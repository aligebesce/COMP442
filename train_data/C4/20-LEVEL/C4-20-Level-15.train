Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of  of this now doesn't there  in Europe?
Yes.
This right wing element which is
Terrible!
"It's frightening really because you think well  you know, I mean  you said the years well that couldn't happen"
Well
again but  but how long does it take before it does happen again?
"I mean, do the other  do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?"
A grand
Well
"scale, if you like?"
"it er  I mean, it's  having grounds now because of the recession!"
Yes.
"That is, that"
Yes.
is what brought it about er in
Setting the stage for
"in one way, in in"
"Although it hasn't  it hasn't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment aren't we?"
In this country?
"Ah but, I mean it's biting in Germany now because they've got all East Germans!"
"That's  yes, yes, that's true."
Biting before that weren't it?
Where
Erm
"they've had to close down the spi ,and that."
"and of course, when, when they  when"
This of course is exacerbated.
but  the going gets tough it's  it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before wasn't it?
"Like on the ruddy  that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!"
You know what you're getting because we've had it before.
"So then I got back on to Gwyllam  and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you  someone there be willing to do the  from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem."
Right.
But he doesn't know any details.
Okay.
Er you know I mean just like we don't.
We don't know dates or anything yet do we?
No.
So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr .
I think that's probably the best.
And just let these do the transporting because this  this fella honest to god he was doing me head in.
"Erm  saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it."
Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times  trying to impress me.
So let's stick to Mr .
We know where we are with him.
"Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that."
Right.
Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
"And we, we've got to wait for erm  Mel  to be in tomorrow."
Haven't we?
Yeah.
And we're obviously going to ask him to
"He, he"
to go ahead with it.
"looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after  the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme."
Mm.
They have a sort of programme of their own  on er doing counts on roads.
I mean  a and most of it's done through the county councils.
"So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment."
"Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided  Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us."
But it's still cheaper than a pub.
"Yeah, yeah."
So we'll have  a couple of drinks and that's it for tonight.
Mhm.
"Jane said that last week, cos I thought it was a disco, cos when it first described it me, it was real crap, and there was this colour guy and his friend, and all they wanted to play was  black, they looked like they got no bones when they were dancing."
"You know like, dislocated themselves."
It's really
"Really, oh no."
"And in fact, all they played all night."
"The funny thing was, I find this really amusing, the bloke who was running the disco, he was putting loads of records on, then going dancing."
"Really, excellent."
How was he doing that?
"Yeah, he really did, and the record would end, and then he'd plonk back."
So they were just playing the music that they liked.
It was only those two dancing all night.
"Oh, what."
"That's what made it so obvious, because it was, he would put the records on, and then come out and start dancing, and I thought I'm not going that  No, they played that,sh what's it, shake, shake, shake the room,"
bought that.
"Oh, she didn't, oh remember the other day,Take That."
I didn't ask.
Oh.
I didn't even  supposed
Would it?
"She said, yeah."
"ought to see  lounge, she's got Take That disco, and Take That"
"Oh, Jesus, she's driving us up the wall."
She's trying to go out and get tickets to see 'em.
Is she?
She's got tickets.
"That's the trouble, but we got a note through the door this morning from our friend Kerry."
Don't buy the Take That tickets.
"I'll explain later,and she's  last night ."
"But then again, if, even Kay over there with  she said something about er, oh we've been out, but, I told you I went to a  last Monday."
Yeah.
"and she said something about, oh we've been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God, she said he's turning into a right old man, and you know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't,"
Exactly.
"She didn't realise what she was saying as such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know."
"Yeah, well he is, what ten years."
Thirteen you got from 'er.
Thirteen years difference.
"She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's twenty-nine."
Same age as our Kim
Yeah.
"Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year, won't she?"
"You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just leaving it."
yeah.
He's really forty-three this year.
Don't work.
"He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be thirty this year."
"The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about,"
Look George
"if yo if one's fifty over sixty,"
He's plucking his feathers out.
then it works.
"But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does."
But when you get into your forties
"Well, it's like, I mean like,"
It works.
I'm  me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago.
"I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even two and three years ago and  somebody'd said to me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said, yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out all night, do what you want."
"Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a  apartment."
"Yeah, that's right, yeah."
Yeah.
"And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went to see Squeeze."
No.
As we was just coming home.
"She stood there  yabbing at the end of the counter, when are you coming out!"
He said oh for God's sake shut up Kim!
So she said er  shut up your fat    !
She didn't!
"He said I've told you before he said, if you ever say that again he said I was gonna knock your head off!"
And anyway I  walked past him and he went back and he was sh moaning at her  so erm  two of the old boys he'd been working with said whatever's all that about?
So there.
I said oh another one!
"I want well out of it, so course she come in  got changed, so he said to me I would like you tomorrow  to have a word with Robin  about stopping her coming down  to us he said because erm  it makes me feel very uncomfortable he said  and we had that hassle he said  it's a load of nonsense he said  I've forgotten"
Well I suppose it does make him feel uncomfortable.
"Yeah  he said I've forgotten about it  Blue's forgotten about it he said, but she won't let it rest he said  he said it's Well she's a child, she's only a child Geoff that's"
Yeah.
why.
Yeah he said I'm not having he says.
"She's like a spoilt child, she's gotta learn to"
"Yeah, he said"
from there soon.
"That's what he said, he said she can throw a tantrum he said and get everybody sort of feeling sorry for her he said, as and when she wants he said."
"Well I suppose it probably wasn't tha , a complete pack of lies Geoff."
"Yeah  so he said I I want ca , Robin to stop her coming down here he said."
So you've gotta be the one who tells him.
Yeah  so Ivan said
Well I think he's right.
"yeah, so Ivan said to me, he said er  he said well I do I suppose you have noticed he said but whenever she comes down here he said  the whole line stops  I said I quite agree  I said well let's be honest about it if he's knocking out the meat he , it's gotta stop  cos he  stops"
Jonathan !
"he stops talking to, stops to talk to her I said and obviously if the meat isn't coming out the box, the meat isn't coming out of the box!"
Well that's right.
Well that is right innit?
Yeah.
But she's like a child really  you gotta pity her really haven't you?
That's right.
I think you did send this is  intending it to be a postal application  Mr ?
"I did, yes."
"But er, your worships  to do it by your colleagues until today  because er  Mr   indicate on the  application form  that er  he will not be  in fact, operating the bar himself but it would be somebody else."
"In fact they, your colleagues wanted more information about"
Yeah that's a
Who will be operating bar Mr ?
Well  I'm I'm on er Mr Martin .
Actually I did  operations between the village hall and the Crosskeys and Mr Martin  is on the  pub for the last sixteen years you see.
Well that concerns this this gentleman to extend the licensing.
"Oh yes sir, definitely."
I'll I'll be going to the village hall  but I me I have to
"The Crosskeys that's why I put Martin , perhaps I've put the wrong thing on you see."
I'll be in charge of the bar actually.
So physically you will be exercising something degree of supervision in the
"Oh that, yes!"
Will you be there when it's time to close Mr ?
"I will, yes."
You see there   in particular to young people.
You are aware of that?
"Oh yes, that, that's why !"
Then this application be granted.
"Right, thank you very much."
Thank you.
Er
"Thank you, thank you very much."
"Application number fifty four your worships, the  a temporary authority in respect of Quick Save Supermarket."
.
Jacqueline  is the applicant your worship.
Are you representing ?
Right.
Could you take the oath please?
Can see me tonight can't you?
"Ah you are going to be so arsed, it's going to be so funny."
"I won't be that bad, I won't have any ci er  get one  gotta get some, have to  now cos we're not gonna have any."
I doubt if I'm gonna get  Phyllis is there.
Phyllis and Johnnie  .
"I call them  but it's not, it's ."
Oh I've got a sore knee ooh
It's no wonder!
"I've got fluid on it, it hurts."
Ooh
"Well you go to sleep bef when they've gone, when they go out"
"Yeah, have a bit of a kip for a bit can't I?"
I doubt if erm we'll be down here before she goes up to mine  I don't reckon.
When?
"Yeah she is, she's dropping in"
"for after, after mum and dad go  have the hand slapping and the  yeah they've gone!"
Anyway I wanna have a bit of a talk to her.
What about?
Well about all this business with Shrimpy.
"Yeah but you, you must admit Shrimpy's trying his damn hardest."
"I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for half the things she was talking about last night, I mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour trying to go to sleep"
"Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other, in the same room, just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other ."
Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just .
"We all know he still fancies her  he's just trying to, you know  keep it  he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to be back to  what, what they were."
"But flipping Scott, mister interferior"
Interferior ?
Yeah interferer.
"Flipping  no, it really annoys me that does."
They're always going on about how much Shrimpy  gets other people involved and  can't  stick up for himself aren't they?
And bloody  Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man.
What sort of things are you gonna say anyway?
"Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy  which is true"
"Now it looks like, ah just stopped moving again, straight line, fixed speed that, this looks as if it's accelerating."
"It's very, it's deceptive if you're not working out what you're doing and relating it back to the graph, and relating it back to physics, to an experiment you're doing, someone's checking the clock every second to see how much further it's gone."
"Oh well, in the last second it went another ten metres."
Last second it went another ten metres.
It's going at a steady speed.
Fixed constant velocity.
"But here, that's still where it was last time I checked my watch."
Yeah.
Not moving.
So that's a steady speed.
And it stops.
"That's, it changes  abruptly."
From a steady speed.
It doesn't need to brake or does it just?
Mm.
"If it's a physical body, to change speed, it'll have to have to brake."
"And the s what would, so, that's a fixed speed."
There's another str another straight line  .
"There's another straight line, another fixed speed."
Which one is faster?
"Every one second,ten metres."
Every second that's going more than ten metres
Right.
So that
So the steeper it is?
The faster.
The faster it's going.
"So at this point, it's almost flat."
So it's going very slowly.
Now what's happening to its speed?
Accelerating.
Yeah.
That's three sixty five please
Two four five  sixty five
Thank you
Thank you  Thank you.
You haven't given me the bits missing from the Mirror.
Well that's erm
Well I'm sorry but my Daily Mirror was dev delivered this morning without the television supplement and without the comic and I want them
the actual page?
The whole supplement that come on Saturdays
That part
That part wasn't in?
This part was not in.
"And there's usually a free comic as well, and that wasn't in either."
And that's the second time in the past four weeks that those pieces have been missing from it
Well
"No, I don't need the whole paper."
I've got the rest of it.
I canna gi' you one under there though
"Well you're going to have to because when I pay for a paper, I want it to be complete, so I want that piece and I want th that piece, no wait a minute, where is it?"
Which is the television?
Where does this start?
That's forty change.
Thanks a lot.
There we are.
"Right, so I've got the two pieces that are missing from my paper"
"Well, I've already paid for mine so I'm going to get"
"Well, you'll just have to tell them that it's missing but when I've paid for a newspaper I expect to get all the pieces that I've paid for and I've already paid for mine, so this I'll take."
Thank you
Hello
Hello
Hello
raises a lot of money through sponsorship  few people committing money every month.
"Twice he became a tutor, but he neglected his work."
"In one case he had an affair with the mistress of the house, which led to his dismissal."
"He had a period as a railway clerk at  Bridge, but was dismissed because of a deficit of eleven pounds."
"As Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans say, it's impossible to know how the money disappeared."
"Embezzlement forgetfulness, inefficiency."
Did Branwell grow up.
He promised to much.
He was his own worst enemy.
"Like the prodigal son, he wasted his substance in riotous living."
"Er, it's a bit of back background then about Branwell."
You know anything about Branwell.
isn't it.
Mhm.
"Erm, that his father didn't make him go to school."
Mm
"Er, there's a suggestion that he had mild epilepsy, and they tried to keep it quite, and his father tutored him at home."
So he didn't have a normal life a boy of his circumstances in those days.
"Would have, yes."
"It was more lonely, there weren't other boys around him."
Mm.
Mm.
"There weren't other people around him, except his family."
"Yeah, So,"
Didn't help an unstable character.
"That may have contributed, yes, yes."
yeah.
Any other
Plus the rather powerful father figure.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Which tend to
"What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating."
"I think what we would do  supposing we didn't, supposing we just had  heavy vehicles and light vehicles?"
That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it?
"Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had  three classes."
"Motorbikes, cars, light goods  H G V including two three and four axle and buses  for the, for the whole count, now for the samples  Rob didn't even want it classified."
It was just a vehicle regardless  of what it was.
Yeah.
I suppose we could do a classified count  er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we?
Yeah.
"Separate, on another day."
Yeah.
Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side.
Erm  perhaps the thing to do is to look at  how it varied in nineteen eighty six.
Did you get that report out?
Yes you did.
How it varied between the two sides.
There's three thousand one hundred there.
Mhm.
That's two way.
On a twelve hour day.
"So assu you're talking about, well supposing that 's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction  over twelve hours."
So you're gonna want to interview  forty percent right?
How many do you think you'll need?
"Do you think you'll need  if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team?"
A half.
A four.
We did have  we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out.
I'm only thinking that  you've got somebody counting?
Yeah.
There's one person counting?
Two.
Two people counting.
Yeah.
D'ya know what I mean?
"And, and obviously it was ridiculous, every second word I was having to look up and then I'd get all that and it moves onto the next one."
Yep.
Which is ridiculous.
Anybody had
this experience?
"Erm  okay, the first word was erm  it talked about alchemy."
Any other problems with the language?
"Either  other areas where it's very specialized and you had to look up words, or other difficulties with the"
Yeah.
language?
It's not everyday English.
It's not everyday English.
"What at the moment, at th right, so a lot of, erm"
Yeah.
Ah but that is a good distinction.
Stereo.
Erm  ahead  in the sense that
Yeah.
we're used to a lot of Shakespeare's archaisms because he was studying them at A level and Shakespeare's got so a special sort of band of them that he uses.
"Even so, I  they can go and look up that lot of words in Shakespeare."
But Johnson  they're often old words  that are totally out of use  erm  and  we're not even used to Johnson's vocabulary because
it's not taught in schools.
At least not part  the mainstream part of our culture.
Any other reasons for the language difficulty?
"Or that the speech is difficult or the, any, any reason that there's a, a page that's difficult to read?"
"Er, it strikes me with the, with the comedy, he's trying to be so funny that he shoots off at all these angles and not having"
Aha.
"left, sort of boundaries."
Okay.
"So  erm  well, you might like to say that"
Yeah.
"Oh yeah fifty, sixty pounds."
And how long would it last them?
About the same time as us?
Yeah.
I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place.
Right.
Yeah if you have to moan about that you shouldn't be driving it in the first place.
"Motto, what?"
"Motto of the story is er  er don't, don't buy expensive cars if you're gonna want to run the thing though."
You've spent all your money on this car.
All of a sudden you realize
"Well like that new advert for the Rover he says don't, I keep thinking my back  my back tailgate's  flapping or  I keep hearing, you keep hearing creaking don't you?"
"A creak here and you think what's that, what's this, what's that?"
"So that new Rover has been built so everything fits perfectly, right?"
So nothing rattles.
What do you mean nothing?
No toleran er the tolerance is you know minimal.
Whereas the tolerance here'd be  I dunno eighth of an inch here eighth of an inch there he says  the advert says as soon as you have tolerances like that then thing work loose and start rattling and creaking and
E E.
you can hear it go E E er E.
Yeah.
"you imagine cruising in a car, lovely car like that  and it makes no noise."
"Just cruising away and it just like glides, and you glide you know  like, like Papa's Citroen type  that kind of suspension."
Yeah.
Is this a new Rover?
Crikey what was that?
A Rover.
Was it that Rover?
Yeah.
"Was this a new, is this a new Rover ?"
Carving everybody up.
"You know, he'll come running  glasses."
Yeah.
I can't do it.
"And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there."
"I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there."
"I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other."
"When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double."
"I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like  pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean,he did it to me when  did it to Johnny."
He probably thought  like.
"He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him."
"Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways."
I haven't got a lot of patience.
"But where  where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered"
Yeah.
"Where, when I start, Albert's"
"He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder and madder, and me dad used to love it."
"But looking back, you know, and now, that's what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up,but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I should just, I should, I mean, how can you change his temperament."
"I mean, I should just turn round and tell him where to go, but."
I think Colin winds you up summat chronic
I know.
And instead of just
Ignoring him.
Ignoring him.
"You don't, he  and he  going through bloody"
"Yeah, I know."
What
A  where
No.
Bird pooh on window.
"But,I mean, er,"
Where the birds have poohed on me window flying past.
Oh God.
Oh aye.
No it's not as if you're all close is it?
No.
And I mean we haven't seen them since ours hardly have we?
No
Watch this fool.
Ram him off the road.
Oh I had a really good day today.
"I didn't go till about  half ten  ah no cos I had a few letters and stuff to write first  and I thought right I'll just take me time  and, cos I wanted to  I didn't wanna go faster than  you know than I should, I should have done sort of thing cos I wanted to time it properly."
Erm it took me an hour and a quarter.
And it's exactly sixty miles into the middle of Caernarvon.
So I
"And that's where the survey's gonna be, right in the middle is it?"
Well no but that's where I had to go.
See you can allow a few extra miles for getting
Oh.
to the others.
So you wanna allow yourself a  an hour and half really don't you?
"Do you think, or not?"
"Well I don't think so because that, I mean there won't be any traffic hardly"
No.
when I'm going so I'll just allow the same.
And then I should do it in an hour.
You know  I'll be leaving at about half five.
"No, not b about quarter past five I'll be leaving, five to quarter past."
That's allowing a  a good hour and a quarter.
But it's not gonna take me longer at that time of the morning than it has done today at eleven o'clock or so is it?
Coming home it took me a bit longer cos it was all that delay at the  hill.
Oh aye that's right I heard it on the radio.
Yeah oh it's pathetic .
"Oh no the rest of it, it's not too bad, it's not a bad journey, it's quite pleasant really."
So I went straight to the  county offices and saw the rooms you know where we're going to
"No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about"
Oh I'm not sure
the
Oh dear
places you can go to
Mm
which is a fallacy
"I thought it was Barry  there, he looked a bit like him."
"No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy."
"E T get down, down."
"Down there, there's a good boy"
"If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice  if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it  you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are."
"in the U K  mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping"
Joking aren't you camping?
Well that's just what it looks like here  you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Mm
Yes
well
"Oh I see, yeah, yes it's"
Mm
"It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol"
Well for us I mean it's
and then the ferry across
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast
Yes
"but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel"
Oh yes I think so  a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us?
Yes I did mentioned it erm
Did you to Ken?
Well you were there weren't you too?
"I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether"
More than half the people don't want any help at all.
"Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily."
"erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating."
"they're both, press it hard  right that's going."
"Press the one, the black one behind there to switch it off."
So we're on now are we?
Come on beauty
Have you made any tea?
No.
"Oh dear, oh dear oh dear."
Oh you   hello little doggy.
"Try cooking this ham, do you think they might like it then?"
Sorry?
The ham.
The dogs.
Try cooking it.
Oh.
Well wouldn't be able  tempt them into er
I mean really they should    they don't mind
Well that's the availability of the things isn't it?
I think you might have to er  take him down the road  afterwards  when it clears up.
Oh you're not going to take them with you?
Well  See how it goes
It's going off a bit now isn't it?
Oh no.
Erm  you do realize this ham is already cooked don't you?
No.
No.
"Thought it might, they won't eat it like that, that's"
Have they not eaten anything at all?
I haven't given them anything yet.
Who's A T S?
Tyres and .
"You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope?"
"Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them."
Precisely for that reason I should think!
"Well wha what he said was  he went up there  there's erm  could they  put on the front wheels  to the back  and the back wheels to the front  didn't say anything  the bloke said, well we can't charge you."
Oh.
And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that.
So this is isn't what it's all about?
"Well, that's how it all come  see he owes them a hundred and seven pound  and er"
when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it.
Oh.
Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it  he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said  we can charge you  but we can't charge you labour.
That's ridiculous innit?
"Yeah, so he said well  charge me for wheel balancing then or something  no he said, we can't do that."
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
So he said will you do it for nothing?
And he said it's not a charity case!
Could you pay him to do it?
He says no.
Said fair enough  he said and with that I come out the garage.
"Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?"
He does now.
So erm  he's phoned up me   your money  cos he said they daren't put me in court you see.
Well that's a ridiculous  thing to do!
"Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further?"
Yeah  yeah well you see what he said was  he could not see how they could warrant   him  that sixty odd come as interest   justify doing it.
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Possibly about a year I think.
Cor!
My God!
"So he said, I'm not having that!"
"Right, okay,my boudoir, I've just seen a few things  together."
"I should get changed, really, but I'll,"
No.
"what I'll do, is I'll  if I give you my clean shirt, you take it round to yours."
"If I want to change, I'll put it, the only thing is, if we do go up the bar, I think I'll be a bit warm, in something like this won't I?"
"Yeah, that's the trouble isn't it?"
But it's so cold out there.
"I know, it's a bloody, it's such a pain in the arse, because you freeze  to death, bloody getting up there, and then when you get in there, it's so bloody hot."
So start with  what the hell  which is really quite aggravating really.
Sorry?
"It's quite aggravating, innit?"
Mm.
"right, she did take that book with her, didn't she?"
Yeah.
Was she supposed to then?
"Right, lipstick, lipstick, lipstick."
lipstick on your collar    told a tale on you
really.
Oops
You need some more curtain hooks.
"No, I don't."
No.
Is that how many there were up there?
Yeah .
Or have they nicked some?
"They  they tended to spread them out a bit, about the house, you know, just willy-nilly, where they were wanted."
"They're just normal ones, aren't they?"
"Oh, I expect so."
"I know, does look a bit silly, doesn't it?"
"They shouldn't be  like that, we should, like, be able to pull cords and curtains as well gathering them a bit."
They are gathered even now.
"You probably can do in that, I just haven't mucked around with it."
"Right, does Saria had a form, she must cos you said she's booked, Peter have you g , Peter you've got forms have you?"
"Don't think she has got a form, no, Alma have you got any spare forms for that."
"No, I think I've distributed them all, didn't I?"
Mm.
We could get one from British Section couldn't we?
"You think, I thought you said she's booked, she hasn't booked."
"Oh no, she's definitely wants to go, but she hasn't actually filled out the form ."
"Well, she's, she's going to it ."
"Erm, yeah I think she said she'd get one directly."
Erm.
"I think er, I guess that any individual members would get them in their, erm journal."
Yes.
"I might, I might, yes, we, I, well, I'll, looks like it ."
"I'm an individual member, perhaps I've done, got round to opening the  ."
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure, they, they have been there  ."
That's possible .
.
Quite happy you know telephone them to send on
"Ah, right, well, we'll just check, yeah."
"Cos that's  when, when, when we get to that nearer the date, we could, we could just, you know, when you're confirmed that you've been booked and you're definitely going, erm we could look at the finances and see how much we could afford to, to give, erm, something to each person to help with,eit either with the accommodation or, or the transport."
Mm.
"Cos the accommodation is quite a bit, isn't it?"
"It's fifty , sixty or more, probably more this time."
No .
Seventy six pounds .
It's seventy six pounds .
Mm.
More of sixty five last year.
"Mm, yes."
Erm.
"That's nice, I'm, it's very good that people are going anyway, it's got"
That's for the whole weekend
"Imagine what it'd be like, when it's really cold."
"And I thought to myself, oh gosh, just drive up there,"
Yeah.
it's only a ten minute drive.
Yeah.
I picked the right time.
"See that's the thing, if I wanna go and do my studying, I can't just go, I have to  and, and dinner starts at erm, if I've got a lecture, my lecture is sort of one o'clock."
Just before one o'clock and the bus goes at five past one.
So I haven't got time to get any dinner.
No.
See what I mean?
"Well, what about"
No.
"So I have to get a bit, er jump on the bus, and then erm, either get something to eat at their college, but then, by that time, you see, cos dinner starts at quarter to twelve, it's all gone."
"And we went there last time, and all they had left was chips and this fatty stew."
"Er, that's"
And that's it.
"No veggies or nothing, no salad."
No veggies
No.
Oh dear
"So, it's, alright it's not a major problem, but that's the only difficulty with it is it's not, it's good having the bus service where you don't have to pay, right, if you don't, like I didn't realize the bus went at five past one, and I was all ready to go, and er, it was ten past one, and I thought, oh no, so I had to wait till three o'clock."
Do some work.
That's a bit silly really.
"Yeah, and then the next bus from six o'clock, is eight o'clock."
And that's the last bus home.
You would have thought these buses would
"It's only a ten minute, it's about a ten minute journey from Digby to Southlands."
Fifteen to Southlands to Whiteland.
"It's all round in a circle, it's not like then, I don't know why."
How peculiar.
"Yeah, it is a bit of a pain."
But er I don't think we need to go to that er length with you.
"I've still got those erm, you know, the little purple tablets?"
Yeah.
"That dissolve in water,"
"Yeah, to soak them."
Mm.
"You could, you could go back on the Permitabs if you want."
"It's not desperately moist, although certainly one of them is cracking quite a bit, and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a soak ten minutes a day."
Mm.
"If you want to try those, you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is a little, just short"
just short of a gallo yeah you need a bowl.
"Yeah, but then you get the right concentration."
"If you use too high a concentration, it irritates and it stains even more than the dilute stuff does."
But that may be worth a go if you've got some Permitabs left.
Mm.
But I think we'll use some Dermavate Have you got plenty of Dipabase
Yeah.
Good.
"A big tub, yeah?"
Mm.
That's fine.
"Is it alright to put that on, you know, when it's broken?"
The skin
"Yes, you've got, you've got to be a bit careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it, they tend to irritate."
"It won't do the skin any harm particularly, but it can smart."
And
Mhm.
that might be one good reason for using the er the soaks.
"The other think I'd recommend, is, using a fine pair scissors, is take off the scaly bits, the bits that stick out, cos they're the bits that catch"
Mm.
and hurt and
Yeah.
Yes.
Bring that ball here!
You got no bloody chance!
"But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!"
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
"You know, but they should be  criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't!"
Well when when  if if the Labour party criticised  and they do criticise
"Oh they criticise Ken, yeah."
"The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on  and you see it happening on the parliament  and on your papers."
Well you read your paper don't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer
We we'll watch
"which is, they get some  they do some pretty good"
"But how often do the  I mean, they  they don't give you  they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week!"
Oh no they're  or there's certain ar
they only pick
a certain subject or
Yes.
whatever that's been thrashed.
"As you say , we'll see."
Well  he's gone on  seven days of the week  complaining about so and so  we'll just narrow that down to one article about his  his complaint that they may just make a little note  he's complained seven times about this!
So you see a little article
That's right.
he's not complaining!
"Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example"
the low wages
Yeah.
"we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France  I in"
Yes.
Italy.
Well yes.
"Oh there we go, that was mistake number one  George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?"
"Inflammable, ain't it."
"Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him insurance, this this, the premises are insured with him,"
Yeah.
"so I thought, well, if he's already got, er, part of his insurance without having"
"Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal."
That's where  cardboard and paper.
Yeah.
"Sasha come in here, shut door."
He's not coming in.
"But er, I can't understand why, because I mean, let's face it,he he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable"
"No, what they're saying is."
"Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity, nobody can breathing it in who's in"
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"They're frightened like, in years to come, like, they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat like that."
Yeah.
"I, it's health and safety, yeah."
er.
"Through the health and safety, but."
Eighty four we had this extension put up.
Yeah.
Sasha come in here.
"But, after saying that,"
There's a draught in
"what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gonna use"
Yeah.
and then find out all about
What ya got?
Don't know.
"them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the company said this and that."
they told him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the only ones that probably need to get made  are census stop if required etcetera.
So there's only three of those.
Yeah slow census and  whatever.
"So presumably if, if  Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon  you know, the rest can sort of fit into place."
"Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and"
Yeah.
Yeah like
you know and
you see yellow ones don't you?
On the motorway and stuff
Yeah.
they have survey on.
"But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little"
Yeah
plate on the bottom that says survey.
yeah.
"Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that  I'd have thought it would be alright."
Yeah.
"Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know?"
"Yeah, I see what you mean."
We might be able to get round it.
I'll see what this fella says.
"Well I mean I was saying to  this bloke well  can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no  no can't think of anywhere."
Well you could try Clwyd or something but   can't think everybody you know.
Clwyd might well do some.
I wonder
Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring.
He's at Cheshire.
Oh yeah.
Who do we know at Clwyd?
Davydd .
Who?
Yeah.
"and er, he's got to do the drinks."
"Oh, that's good, isn't it?"
"So he gets twenty five pound for the for the night, and he hasn't got to start until about nine o'clock anyway   so erm that's, that's something for him to do, isn't it?"
"Oh, that's really good."
Yep.
"erm, Jay's sister, Tamsin it's her twenty first on Monday, so he was, like, write out her birthday card, right, and he was like, trying to write something funny, so he was constructing this thing, like reading it out to me, and  half an hour when I first got there."
Yeah.
"And er, it was very amusing, but repeatable, half the things he wrote in it, and erm, it's very, it was very good, but, he is quite good at that when he sets his mind to it, it usually takes him about three days to do it, but he does like to er, write messages in people's cards."
And er
"He's a laugh, your brother."
"He's a nut-case.  up to him  seems a  it's Mark, I couldn't believe it."
"It was like, get on to those bloody phone people, he said, I was on the phone to them for half an hour, yesterday, he said  haven't turned up, he said, and I organized m I work around  and everything."
"He said, and then I got you to come along, he said, and it's all for nothing."
"It's always the bloody way, innit?"
"And I said, well go and pick the phone up  Oh, yes, we have got a phone, actually"
Before you start whacking your breasts.
Mm.
I haven't had a phone all week.
"Which it isn't the easiest thing, when you've just moved into a place, is it?"
No.
"I mean, erm, you know, at least we're all sort of easy walking distance of one another."
"Like we council with our daily contacts through college, but"
That's true.
"like, you know, everyone's far away from them."
"Exactly, they"
"Quite a distance, haven't they?especially for emergencies."
"It's worrying,"
Mm.
isn't it to think that
Yeah.
someone can't get hold of you.
"you can't tell him nothing  he would say  oh no no no, beer's no problem, beer's no problem no  it's not that experience, not that experience, I said well you wanna smell yourself Cliff!"
Cor God!
Well I still   alcohol.
it does.
Yeah alcohol
And your guess is that  he said er  bought something
Guinness is a heavy drink!
Yeah he's
That's surprising he don't have such a bad head!
No he said er
Ah  Cor!
Well fancy being a like that all that time  it's bad enough when you've been out on a binge and you get that headache then.
"Chris  Ivan said to me, he said  Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday  he said last night, I tell you, I said   I said no, no I didn't!"
Well how are you all gonna get home?
"Oh yeah he don't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home."
I said well I hope you enjoy .
"Well it isn't worth it, you can't afford to drink and drive can you?"
I know.
"Mel's got her lights up, did you see them?"
Yeah well   yeah.
"Mm  yeah talking about that now he's out the way  basically what he was gonna say was, as simple as this"
.
well it don't matter does it?
Oh alright then.
Yeah  no he was just saying that head office  they'll dictate to them like anybody else  so he said  I've got to have  erm  the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
"I thought you'd done that, you was gonna do that?"
"Yeah but I haven't  that's what he saying, but he said what I wouldn't do is ju , don't just say right phrum  there's"
What do you mean?
"there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right  sort of over the next month  but he said basically I cannot do anything until  erm  the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I can't do anything for you until then."
Did you tell him that?
Who?
Malcolm.
The acceleration there is say forwards.
One two
"And for every one second, you're going forty metres per second."
So you're going at a steady speed.
Per second.
"It's, it's a, it's an acceleration, it's metres second to the minus two."
"Now are you happy with that, because most people aren't?"
Okay.
"We'll come back to that in a minute, but  let's say  a rocket, or a car, which would you prefer that do?"
Car.
Car.
Constant acceleration car.
"Erm  no frictional resis resistance, you just put your foot down and it's, you know where a car accelerates from rest"
Mm.
and then after a while the acceleration reduces?
"The speed is still going up, the acceleration, and eventually it reaches a top speed and it stays there."
Mm.
"Okay, it's zero acceleration, it's not getting any faster."
Mm.
Erm  how would we measure that?
A constant acceleration.
Say we had an accelerometer.
An acceleration measurer.
Mm.
"Which  force on a weight or something  can feel acceleration, I think you can, my son said you can't but I think you can"
"So, acceleration is a constant."
What's your eventual top speed?
"It just, just keeps going faster and faster and faster and faster"
Infinity.
"Infinity, speed of light, when you hit something."
It's pretty high.
Mm.
Another one at Holgate Road fifteen erm York Road Acomb twenty.
Walmgate twelve pounds and Hull Road twelve pounds.
Er Fulford Road eighteen pounds.
Presto Main Street Haxby eighteen pounds.
Another couple at Acomb for twenty pounds and then they also give just a cost for Ripon and Scarborough.
So I don't know about anybody else but that's cheaper than I expected it to be.
Yes absolutely.
And the fact that they're several in Fulford that I'd say are very good sites.
I always read them erm when I  about Fulford .
At Fulford Road or Fishergate would be the best one to go for.
Yes.
Are these the sort of the like to the end of bus stops?
Well from what I can gather the cheaper one on Fishergate is a bus stop size one.
There's one actually at the bus stop by the Police Station and there's another one on the corner of the erm just before you turn into  Terrace there's there's a free standing one outside the shop there.
And I think the eighteen pound one is probably the big one on the side of Jacksons building.
Erm actually high up you know full size billboard.
Which I'd say is less useful in fact than the little ones.
I think the little ones might  noticed.
Cos I mean I all whenever I'm going travelling into into York and they've changed that billboard I always look at it.
Yeah.
People in cars will notice the big one a lot better .
Yeah that's true.
Which is our target audience
Obviously yes.
wait at bus stops.
Right could be a policy decision this couldn't it?
Anyway I suppose before we decide we really need to know how much the National Party are going to charge us if anything for the actual posters and what the posters look like.
Yeah.
And how many posters they what size and shape of posters they're doing which will affect which site of course.
That's right.
no good.
So I'll give
Mm.

Mm she doesn't seem daft yeah.
"She's not clever cos she's  bearings ,"
Erm it it it no
she doesn't seem engineering clever.
No.
But she's not daft.
No but but you're gonna help them.
Yeah yeah.
You're going to your object in life is to help her do the job better.
Right.
And explain to her.
And by sitting down and having a technical and commercial conversation together
Mm.
you can sort of chair that that
Mm.
meeting and help her to understand
how much we're helping them through this  .
and appreciate how much else we can do.
And and okay if we're a pound or two different.
We're forty minutes up the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we can't e e I've had a couple of months of stock on the shelf for 'em.
Yeah.
"In fact I must admit, I hinted to Dave  if if linear will do consignment stock for , why shouldn't we if we're only forty minutes away."
But I mean that's the last thing I wanna do but
Yeah.
"but even then we could have consignment stock here in effect cos they're only forty minutes away, we could throw 'em in the back of the car and have 'em delivered."
"Well that's what we've got we've got consignment stock here, it's on our premises"
Yeah.
Well that's daft innit?
"I says I don't, I says when am I gonna be able to go to town I says and afford fifteen quid for another bloody rail?"
I says you
When you've already got some up.
Yeah!
She wants me to take them down and swap them for one.
Steve'll go mad.
Yeah.
Bloody would an'all.
I thought you crafty sod.
"She wants them to extend to eight feet, well these don't extend to eight feet, they extend to seven."
Oh.
"And I thought no I'm not, Steve's just cleaned them up."
Yeah.
He spent about two hours in with them.
"Have you seen what he's done to ends of them, they've gone silvery, he's rubbed and rubbed and rubbed"
Rubbed too bloody hard .
and he's rubbed all colour off it.
They've got silver ends on them ones.
I said
I says can't you rub harder on other piece.
He ain't done them ones yet.
He's done these ones.
"Well they, are they not silvery then?"
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off
Ah!
"on ends, so he took the two ends off, cleaned the rails and he was sat on settee watching telly rubbing away and rubbing away and I says hey you gonna put them ends back on?"
And he'd been rubbing for that long they'd gone that colour.
Like my Steven with my new non-stick pans.
I remember.
He took all the black off.
He scrubbed and scrubbed till it all come off didn't he?
mm.
"And she said er  well it does take time for them to dry out doesn't it, she said?"
"But I, there was people in it last week!"
"Yes I know, she said!"
Well if she's covering
I said well there's no way I
she is paid to cover the boss!
"There's no way I'd of slept in it, I said and not  I wouldn't of done it!"
"Let alone, old age pensioners, I said!"
And you know  we've been to a few caravans
Go in that end bedroom and feel the bed!
"that feel a bit, caravans that we used to go to were like this chalet."
The chalets we used to go to  Mrs er  I can't remember her name now!
But her boys used to run steam roller outside middle house and I used to take them in.
She used to see  that the beds were aired.
She did see to them!
She put oil heaters  in the caravan  and she kept the  the mattresses in her bungalow!
She'd only got about eight caravans then.
"And  then we went in and had a caravan  somewhere up by Aberystwyth, Ginnie and me, and you kids."
That was an old farmer's caravan weren't
Yes.
it?
"But it wasn't too, that was too damp to sleep on!"
"who won the bloody war,roof up weren't it !"
"There wasn't, there wasn't a cup and saucer each!"
Remember?
Mm.
And these are no better!
"I mean, caravans are caravans, call them what you like!"
Only one saucepan we had!
And it was stew everyday if we didn't go out for dinner!
Ah!
"Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to"
I saw Mr Bentley
Mm.

No.
"but er, he said oh try the guy"
Try?
"the chap in Mold, whatever his name is"
Robert .
"I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well"
Mm.
"so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the"
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over.
"Mm, I don't think so  but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all"
"Nobody's interested no, it's a shame"
"said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er"
"Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the"
Yes
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall
"Hawkesbury hall, yes"
"by the school, yeah"
"but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be"
"Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe."
Is it?
"Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it"
Oh oh they've just locked
but er
locked it up because er
And I was to show him what to do and I made sure that all .
On the first day I made sur I stayed with that man all day.
As I said I stayed with that man all day.
Although I wouldn't t in interfere with  show him how to do the job and  er I would make sure he understood the job.
If he asked me such and such I'd say now this is how you do it.
"If he said to me, after I'd shown him, that he understood it, I would say alright, show me how you do it."
And then that way the man learnt.
Mm.
The man himself learnt.
"And usually the man telling me he understood if eventually when he starts the job, he hasn't understood at all, he's just saying so, but I wanted to prove to the man himself that he could do it and prove to myself that he could do it."
So I was in a safe  and so was the man.
But
So you were given the responsibility then to train people up?
given the first in this .
Now then that were left on the
Did erm do you still keep up your union er membership right away when you were

Mm what did you go on to do after that?
After the business folded?
Was there anything like erm redundancy money or anything like that payed at that time when the place
Er
folded?
And can you remember what year it was?
Oh it's about
Just roughly.
"fifty, fifty seven I think."
It was somewhere thereabout.
Mhm.
And they didn't have all this er legislation about redundancy money or anything then?
No no.
"And could you tell me when and where you were born, please?"
"Yes, I was born in  Lane at  Lane on the eleventh November, nineteen seventeen."
And erm could you describe the house you were born in at all?
"Yes, it was a tt a very large semi-detached house  with erm a smallholding attached."
My father was a miner but loved his garden and we had a big smallholding
Mhm.
"all garden, and at the bottom was a streamlet, then had trout in it.."
"So did you live with your parents, in your both your parent in your early life?"
"Yes, erm, that was where I was born and er then when I was five my father erm hit a bad patch and he sold the house and er he decided to become a shoemaker in Baysford."
And he and my mother had a disagreement about this and er the result was that my father became very ill and I went home to Grandma.
And you you lived with your grandparents then?
"Yes, and then my father, when he had recovered a bit, he came to live with Grandma."
Mm.
"And we I had a brother, a younger brother, as well."
Mm.

Did you ever get any feeling of sort of distaste from anybody about about y your mother leaving home?
No.
No.
"My father was  shall we say, well respected and er no, there was no There was never any query about it."
Mm.
"So, you lived with your grandparents then."
Was your grandfather a miner as well?
"Yes, my granda this was my second grandfather because my gra my own grandfather had died, before I was born, and my grandmother had married again and he was a he was the arm-setter at  Colliery."

She's not in till nine o' clock.
"Well they  anyway, were they?"
They were
"order it specially  cos it's not a book you'd ask for often, is it I suppose."
"Yes I know er yes I er er I er er I, I think it's a good thing  that people, if they ask for information, you've got to buy books to get them."
But what's aggrieved me is that he's just waltzed off with it  and not
It looks like he just  and come here just to get a book.
"I'll ask him  and he's, he's just ignoring all the er"
That's right  a letter that we're taking him to court

"Okay, a course on presentation skills."

I know  has so several of you have already been on a  training course so you'll know the sort of er way in which we work and the way things happen.
erm let me just let me just ask you first of all what  is the value for you and for the company of of developing skills on presentations.
What's the value?
Respective clients
"Indeed, indeed so that's what you might use, yep  What's the value, I mean what does it do what does it do for the company first of all?"
Promotes it
"Promotes it, so it's about image isn't it?"
They had a working committee didn't they and a sub
It's East Herts isn't it?

Was it East Herts?
"East Herts, yeah."

The work's  committee
district council meeting.
"Well I know at district  council there was two environmental groups, was it the officers group and the  members group."
Oh.
I wonder which group
Herts county council.
Cos when I was on the Hertfordshire Environmental  of the group which has folded
"I've got all this money in the Abbey National and there's no, no group any more, I think I'll have to keep"
Keep quiet.
I'll have to send it off to .
But anyway it transpired that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible.
Because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done.
Oh.
I suppose that was one way of nothing being done.
"Yes, they didn't communicate."
The officers group and the members group that was right.
And what happened say
They would never
were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft?
No no I don't think ever I can remember.
I th well I think er there was once or something but he he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on.
Mm.
You see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on.
No they would never they would never blend together.
Mm.
Like whiskies  blend .
No no they would never.
They were they were very very fine people.
And and the tinkers that came there.
Mhm.
Er wouldn't want to but from from  there was there was one lot.
And there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths.
They would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your sc er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there.
So they were all and very industrious looking.
But they had for the winter time they their houses to go to.
Mm.
And they were just coming round in the summer.
Mm.
And their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm.
Did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers?
Not really no.
You've never heard the term summer walker?
Er er no no I could never say that.
Or mystery folk or?
Er well
Celts.

Well that sort of people that was coming.
But what if they don't.
You've lost all your  ain't ya.
"Ya, so that's  the end of the world."
Even if you find out they won't.
No.
Why don't you get a free  put on market.
"No, the on the company's, that's coming up with all the money got to"
Oh aye.
do the valuation.
"And they ought to form  value of what, so they know how much it's worth, what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the valuation."
It's just another way of making a bit more money out it.
That's it.
"Well, it's same as when you buying and selling 'ouses."
"You  when it comes out, when, the people that's, mind me cigarette, darling, the people that's gonna buy your 'ouse, who, mortgage company comes out and values it, they've got that to pay as well haven't they."
Yeah.
"The same as, I, them that buys our 'ouse, they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money, we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down there."
Yeah.
"It's only money  I mean, how long are they 'ere."
Yeah.
Ten minutes.

"Well, I tell you what, if you walk over to Annette's."
"If, if you want to go to the bar, walk over to Annette's after you've finished, because we probably won't go up until about nine, half nine, would we, and then we'll go up with ya."
"Well, we'll wait until you come round, and then decide what to do."
"okay,"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"And then you know, if you've coming back, I'll drop you back home."
Thank you.
Rather than walk back on your own.
thank you.
Have fun.
So  he's seventy eight now  she's probably about the same I think.
Mm.
But they had a Mini before the Metro and er  the day they bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if you buy a Mini in the next few days
give you a free colour portable with it.
Oh.
"Of course they didn't get the portable with this, they rang them up, said where's my colour portable    said I'll put you on to the manager  anyway  they had some deal that night that erm to launch this Mini Mayfair or whatever it was  wine and cheese thing  so he went to the wine and cheese thing  and  worried he was gonna kick up a fuss  so they gave him a telly anyway ."

"He's a penny pinching old bugger he is, god!"
I can't quite imagine
No.

Yeah   What about ?
"The dust wagon came up to the warehouse today, the usual   they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin in the back"
Oh yeah.
and the hydraulic hose on the back of the dustcart broke  there was hydraulic fluid all over the
all over the car park.
So the driver said can I use your phone?
He came in  and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet.
He got through to the  base camp to find out when the  chap was coming to fix it.
"Five minutes later he came in trying to tell  tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just  you know, brains"
Mm.
Hand picked for the job I should think.
Well we didn't notice the footprints until he'd left.
Mm.
Yeah  of course once they get to know where you are
This is it
and you don't o do you open weekends?
You don't open Saturdays now?
"We don't, no."
No.
Are you going to?
No we don't.
I know they don't like it
"No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos"
Oh hello
"Hello Margaret, well"
"twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to"
and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in
Most of them don't do their own now do they?
No
"We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop"
I
"when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away"
Yeah it's a
I don't fancy doing by hand
"Well, even that little one of mine"
"No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before"
"You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know"
"Yes, yes, oh yes"
"and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and"
"and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree"
"they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade"
"Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah"
"that's right, yeah"
I think
"bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day"
"Yeah, yeah"
"How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?"
I don't know
It must of had a good iron in it.
"Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me"
Yeah and I used to see them many a times in
"and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least?"
"Oh I, yeah"
I noticed they had some Philippine mahogany doors in  Do It All
Mm.
"on Saturday and yet, that you have to be careful because  they they have that I've forgotten what her name was on on Wogan saying next time you go into a D I Y store and you see a mahogany toilet seat  you know don't boy buy it think of the forest."
Well if you go into a D I Y store you'll find it's a mahogany stain  I don't know if they really make mahogany .
It would be very expensive
Yes you'd probably gauge by the price I would think.
Yeah.
Plastic
plastic.
plastic one.
Erm  oh
Yes actually  this cycle thing .
Cycle parking is actually  I wish they'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you didn't have to sort of tie it up to some lamppost or something
"Yeah, yeah."
There's hardly anything
I mean they could give you a decent stand to put it in cos I hate those ones at Sainsbury's.
"Cos if you've got anything heavy in the bag, the bike falls over."
The ones at the library  as well.
Er and they ought to have a little shelter over it to stop your saddle getting wet  if it rains .
"I've got, I mean I've got my spots where I park it, I, it at Woolworth's and outside the post office  because it keeps it dry."
And out of the way.
All the roads into town are just awful.
"I mean the Dunmow Road, Hockerill"
Oh yeah.
You know  really scary.
You know you get asphyxiated with petrol fumes and then you get the danger of being  thrown off your bike.
cycling
Yeah  they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to Hockerill lights.
I
You must to  cat.
Just walk  slowly in the middle of the road.
So that there's no way they can take overtake on the right or on the left.
"Like, I really felt abused."
I mean at the time
Ya.
"I felt sorry for him but  I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it."
That's
The next
isn't it?
the next time you see the girls in the choir
I'll bet they'll turn round and say
"Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then"
be careful of whatever his name is.
he was then saying erm  now what about a concert this Friday?
"Erm, there's such and such going on."
"And there's one er  a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm  I'm away those weekends."
"I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend"
"Yeah, let's not."
and he said erm  have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
"And he said, hadn't you better check?"
"And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm  I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way."
"I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?"
"I said, I'll see you at choir."
But we don't get to see each other at the choir
"erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill."
"I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm  pressure!"
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said
"Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from"
then he said I'm lonely.
"Yeah, so said it was that  spaghetti Bolognese that did it."
Makes you thirsty.
Mm.
"Well, it's probably"
Mm.
it's probably that.
Maybe it is a flu going around then.
Well these all need to be  well I mean quite often this stuff we can
Throw?
"no, no, half of this stuff we can actually  keep bi , or or leave, leave for them because it's actually  relevant information."
What leave them bills and everything?
No I mean it's
And guarantees?
"Well it's no damn good to us once we've moved, is it?"
"Ooh God, they've had the house at a cheap rate anyway!"
They can damn well pay for these stuff if it breaks down!
That's not the point!
Just stop it!
Are we taking the cooker with us or not?
"Not the cooker, no."
"So they get i ,we will work pay for all our appliances and stuff?"
Eh?
Will work pay for all our appliances?
"Not all of them, no."
"Well a lot of , yeah?"
And water softener as well?
All those big salt pebble things I have to fill up every week in the ?
Well I guess we may get a  we may get ourselves a  waste disposable unit.
Good!
"Get one of those we got  in, particularly in favour of those."
Does she like them?
Stick some raw eggs and things down there.
"No, there's always been a mandate workshop, explaining why, you know, what our mandate is ."
"You, you did give once to a group a few years ago."
"Yes, I've done the mandate workshop, yes, and I've done it with other groups too."
Mm.
"So you've covered a bigger region in the past, not just Stortford."
"I, I have about five or six groups, I can, I can go and give talks  ."
"So even if we don't  call on you to, do it, you won't be called  ."
And I have a lobby workshop too.
"Amnesty's mandate what, what the  don't do, or do do."
"Will there be any erm talking about lobbying, be in, in erm  before and er ."
I don't know .
Done any .
.
So the er lobbying workshops is the
.
That's why they're being cancelled
"Epping Forest and Redbridge are doing, erm, they've got some lobbying workshops"
"Mm, presuming it's got that in mind"
"Yeah, I mean he is  ."
.
"Lobbying workshops would be that combined, erm  there is er, a one page journalist leaflet which we can order a pound for a hundred, that's it, that's all our journalist  friends ."
", yes that's , erm  yeah, I, last month I received the er, this booklet on the  trade and they seemed to be coming out to doing campaign on erm a collection between British training and goods, er and their use abroad erm, and they now, they've got a, a booking form for a fringe meeting at the A G M, if anyone's particularly interested attending."
"Shall I pass, shall we pass this one ."
.
"Yes, the report on this, this book."
"Yes,there are, there are feature on the, just highlighting a couple of case for these, I imagine a problem book"
Yeah.
"and, there is ."
"It is a good book that I, I've read through that, it's quite an informative."
It was in one of the Sunday .
"It's called the M S P, the Military Security Police, mm."
Security
"Having came to the  he was hungry, so he was glad to be h hired by a local farmer as a swine herd."
"Even the pods he was giving to the pigs, he would have liked to have eaten himself."
"He decided to go home, and offer to be a servant instead of a son."
"But his father was overjoyed to see him, and at once threw a party."
His elder brother coming home from the fields and hearing dancing enquired what was going on.
"When he heard the explanation, and that even the best calf had been killed, the fatted calf had been killed, to help the party he was furious."
And that is understandable.
"At this point, we are then asked to consider, does the elder brother become the family black sheep, is there a sort of change of position."
I don't know what
I wouldn't think so.
No.
a brother.
The story makes its point to the finish.
Mm.
Mm.
"So th they,yo yo you couldn't see a situation where the person who er was previously in disgrace, was no longer in disgrace, and the one, the the the brother, then showing je jealousy, was himself in disgrace."
Sounds like fiction.
Sounds like fiction.
"No, it's just the father's attitude that changed, not the way that"
Mm.
Mm.
"Well, he, he was repentant, he was only repentant because he was hungry."
"Yes, yes, yeah, yeah."
"Can you stop being a black sheep then, did did did he stop being a black sheep when he came back."
"Was that the end of the story, as Trevor was saying."
"Well, he certainly gave the father the opportunity to say, I told you so."
Mm.
Mm.
"Done, Yeah"
Mm.
Or he could say I was one
"I was one of the black sheep, but I'm no longer."
"Many would say that as George the Sixth, he succeeded where Edward had failed."
George had discipline.
"A sense of duty, a loyal wife and children."
"Affection bringing with it devoted support, brought success from a role undertaken reluctantly."
Edward said he could not fulfil the role without the support of the woman he loved.
Some family black sheep are making a bid for affection.
"Edward had the attention of the whole world, but without adequate personal affection, it was of no avail."
"On December the eighth, nineteen thirty-six, time of the ab abdication, the Times published a singularly apt quotation from  A Hopeless, Throneless King, Loathsome to Men Below To God's Above a Sad Example of the Slights of Life."
What is your view of the way Edward was treated after his  abdication.
"And none of us admits to being alive when all this happened, we, that goes without saying."
Absolutely.
I did see him as a six year old child.
"So  yes, as a"
"Visited our town, our  town."
He was a six year old child.
"Erm, I was a six year"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah."
So wh wh what do you think of the the attitude that was displayed towards him after the abdication?
"He was very, very, generously treated."
Far too generously.
"I mean, he he could  five hundred thousand pound on a Christmas present to his bride."
My God.
Mm.
"He was more or less paid to go away and keep his head down, wasn't he."
Yeah.
No matter what the cost.
Most of the cr
"Now it's all over,attitude, push it all away."
Yeah.
"All the here , a lot of the hereditary jewellery never, never got found."
No.
No.
Ha!
"I mean, even in France, and I mean, in fact, in fact"
"East Germany, poor devils they"
"in France it's more  it's worse  in in  some respects because er  it seems to be more powerful the erm  the rate of  you know, the feeling of ."
"I mean what can you, what can we do?"
"If, it's happening, I mean  what was the Soviet Union I mean it's"
"Well I said to Margaret, I wonder"
news on it  it's death and destruction there isn't it?
All these minority
I wonder
groups.
"with the Western Groups  after the euphoria of saying oh there, well we've cracked it now!"
We've destroyed communism.
Are they now regretting it?
"And, I don't"
To some degree.
Well
"No, no I think they've"
"And, and the fact that they don't know what's gonna happen, how to contain all this"
Well I think in some respects
stress.
"they, they wanted the downfall of communism"
Oh they did want it!
but  nevertheless it's better the devil you know!
"But, having said that  you know, that  I should imagine that the military  are  regretting it."
"Well I mean, the military will definitely"
"regretting it, in in   the west"
Didn't actually want it to go this far.
because it means  a reduction in forces in in  all these
Yeah.
"countries  erm, and as you say, I mean ha  you know, whether they're American generals or or  the Soviet  generals, whatever  er they're all, they're all feeling the pinch now because er"
"Oh I didn't mean that, I mean"
Because there's so many.
"She keeps on about all the time, every time I'm there."
Where you going now.
Whose house are you going to.
"It's almost like I'm a refugee  I felt right  I'm like, you know,"
"When you go home now, to which house?"
Where are you going.
"We were walk walking to erm the, down the high street and a plane went over, and erm, I think mum must have been saying to her about Aunty Jill being on holiday, and she went, ah, there's Aunty Jill in the plane going to the city."
It was really funny.
"I said, where did she get that from, my mum went oh I don't know."
"She went, yeah, my Aunty Jill's gone to the city, she's gone to a city."
"And then she said to me, and then, when I was going, she went to me, would you like to come on holiday, I went, then she went, because of me and mum and dad, we went another day to holiday, we went to beach, and er, mum said, that, yeah, mum said that she was saying, erm, to her, why, why is it not, what was it she said, about the weather, mum was moaning saying it was cold, and she went why, why aren't we go on holiday, mum, and mum said we can't, we can't afford to go on holiday, and she ah, why don't we go to seaside when it's cold."
"Mum says cos it costs lots of pennies, she went ah, another day, we'll go another day."
It's really funny.
She's got no concept of time.
"No, she hasn't  age, because she thinks she's  she's been a big girl, and she's now a little girl."
"That's right, yeah."
"She thinks she's  er, when I was like you, when I was a big girl,"
Yeah.
I did things like that.
Yeah.
Whereas not I will do things like that when I get older.
"Yeah, she thinks that she's been big already"
"Yeah, when I was, er she says when I was as big as Rebecca or when I was a big Joanna, it's always the name."
What did she say she did
"Just like,"
"got something on, or you got something."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had one of them
Yeah.
when I was a big girl.
She is.
"She'll bite you, and our Whisky can"
"She scratched him outside, didn't she."
"And, if she were here three and a half minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em fifty quid."
Yeah.
Bloody ridiculous.
It's all a bloody money making racket.
"Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want er, they always having valuations, they are, they come and value it, and then they give us money."
That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got.
Yeah.
That's another reason we're daren't send it off.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business."
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
Yeah.
"Trust them, because it's in their  at the moment."
"Well, I still believe in  and I don't pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no you can't get insured, and so that means  others."
You haven't lost anything have ya?
"Well, just er disappointment, I suppose."
For what
"Well, yeah,"
"Then again, I mean, I"
There's always summat else you can go and do.
"You know that, doing that, fabricating, and things like that, you know like actual welding and that type of  Er, we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would"
No.
"No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for 'im."
No.
And it kills your eyes welding.
Benjy.
"But as he said to me, why don't you go  welding."
"I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is,"
Yeah.
so I said well why's that then Norren?
"I've got used to doing it now, you know?"
Yeah
Well she said she's got a lot of scrubs to do and all that business
Yeah
"so she said while you've been doing that she said she's been sort of gassing to anybody you know, so she said it's been mentioned by management and they said oh well she'll be able to sort of hovering while she stood there you know, time, time to natter she could be erm, got time to do that."
"yeah  so I said oh I see, so that was that, so I think they've got a, a meeting in a couple of weeks and they'll sort of tell her discreetly that she has to carry on and do it what she's been the"
"time sort of thing you know, so, said it's been noticed that like"
and all that you know?
Yeah
"But erm, you know, get"
it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know
Normally
that is the same thickness as what this I think  can you hold that dear?
I'm surprised Joy didn't say something about it yesterday actually Joanne
Perhaps she didn't have it
she done quite a bit of hovering really
"Oh that's good then, yeah"
Is it alright now?
"Well, yeah"
It'll only pop out I suppose won't it?
Well it have to pop out but it keeps popping back in again that's all that is
Sorry
"alright thank you, prefers than what you done last time"
"Yeah better than that, yeah"
How's your mouth then?
Alright
Where's the other lighter?
There in here
oh I see.
Where's Samuel
where's Samuel's?
"I know erm  I thought I wrote to the electricity board in, I wrote to somebody  about erm how er things should be labelled about how efficient they are when using electricity."
You took part in the er electricity efficiency didn't you?
Yes.
"Yeah but didn't, we didn't write to our MPs though."
I thought we were
"supposed to write to somewhere else  was it  the department of the environment or  now what would it be, energy?"
"We wrote, wrote to them cos I've got a reply to that letter somewhere with a great wad of information"
about various fridges and
"Yeah, yeah"
and things.
Yeah
So I can't really say we've written to the MP can we?
We haven't found out about company car fleets have we?
We tried.
Well I tried and then I was let down by the group.
I don't remember anything about that one
We arranged it  two days or three days and each was cancelled
March ninety one?
. In March this year?
It was this year.
Last year.
Last year.
I didn't think we'd done anything about that this year.
But that was last year.
Yeah.
But we haven't done a march  ninety one then.
Scanned the local press for power station applications or authorizations  H M I P.
Written to Michael Heseltine about acid rain?
May ninety one.
Written to your MP to ask him her to press for strict E C standards for C O two emissions from vehicles May ninety one.
when was that?
Wasn't that on the talk?
Let's throw the keys away
I was saying to David this morning there was a  on the police  that was good
probably terribly naive
oh it says something like J R Green a number which doesn't exist and any tradesperson could have the name address type of trade and a real phone number
course they would
yeah
You could change the signs quite regular though couldn't you
Painter and decorator one day and er butcher the  other
Quite easily
"throw, throw some paint over the back and everything  paint running out the back"
Mm yeah
detail like that
Hear that
"rubbish really, not our problem, anybody else want to bring any points up"
No no
"We've got dates for the meeting, I've got two suggestions, one is that I can't see any point anymore why"
here here
and it's  to one
"yeah, here here"
"better headquarters,"
"yeah, where where"
"S thirty one, if we book it in advance we can get in S thirty one downstairs  in the canteen, cos we're only an hour and half, two hours meeting"
yeah
We can be finished by quarter to twelve
"Good idea, any items of agenda for Sergeant , who will be organising the next meeting in S thirty one"
Okay yeah fine twenty eighth of March
Hang on
He's on holiday
bloody right
The meetings
coming for comments like that
There's an S L O's meeting on the twenty eighth of March
Mm.
They were talking  pedestrianizing
"I think that's been on, on the cards for a long time hasn't it?"
Yeah.
Pedestrianizing and they've never done it.
Sorry!
Erm  Wh have we done anything about the environmental charter?
Because I  started doing it a long time ago
"Yeah, yeah Bob did that didn't he?"
It vaguely Yeah and we presented it and then it fizzled.
The group  fizzled out because we presented the charter.
And that was the aim of
It asks here have they adopted it?
Erm
wouldn't or we aim to still try.
Well  .
"I I think, I've a funny feeling that  did  adopt it but quite how much that means I don't understand."
"Well it's awful, having to do this  questionnaire we, we've done ."
All these workshops that have been going on that we haven't been to.
Well they just kind of recognized the principles don't they but they don't ensure that they'll actually put them into practise.
That's what adopting means  it's not actually committing .
"Yes I thought they had, yes."
How about these questions.
Does the group have a constitution?
No.
Does the group have an office?
No.
We've got our plastic box!
Plastic?
"I know I know everybody will be disappointed but I couldn't get  cardboard ones, stick it all in."
We bought the storage boxes anyway to keep all the .
No but you can't really I mean that's what  supposed to have it like an actual proper office.
"your letters look nice and neat, mine are always scraggy, I can never understand them."
"Dear Helena, I don't really  rea really know how to put this but I've had  I'll have a go."
I'm sorry about being in a mood on Saturday but I wasn't really in a mood with you.
I'll now tol t no  I know I told you that I was  that I was feeling
"That, that's"
sorry for someone not Emma or
he's done a sentence wrong there.
one like that .
Yeah.
I care for Emma more than I can say but I also care for you and I'm really sorry if you were hurt.
At the moment everyone has been talking about other people behind people's backs.
I didn't tell you what Emma thought because I  don't   is that a blank page?
Yeah.
I don't think a person told  I don't think a person told to  apologize isn't rea really an apology so I think there must be a reason why you didn't and so told me on Sunday why you didn't .
What a load of waffle.
"Oh I know, he just waffles."
I was going to apologize for being  stupid on Sunday when you both disappeared.
"Me and Andy looked all over, looked for both of you."
Last night I had a few things on my mind to be able to  apologize.
I'm sorry and hope we can still be friends .
I read it and I just went  what! for a start and then
"I went, and then I went  well he can't have looked around for us too well because we were walking by the side of the road."
But  yeah he probably come past  no he probably went up there as we come down that corner  by erm Ipsleigh and when they come back we'd probably gotten here by then.
"But we, I mean we were walking by the side of the road all the way up Greenlands Drive."
"What did I say, Scott then had the cheek to something me?"
"Wish me, that was it wasn't it?"
Scott's not your best friend at the moment then?
"Oh you may not have, you may have gathered that like anyway."
Erm enough  enough  of slagging   slagging  the little shit I think
The little shit .
shit stirrer.
"No, yes, shit ?"
Er   ha !
Wimborne market every Tuesday  and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.
"Used to have  horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday."
Ha!
You wouldn't think that there was a  enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?
But  mm.
"Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars."
I can remember  first motorcar that we drove in   old Charlie  's.
"Old Charlie's  car  wooden spokes, wooden wheels  solid tyres  and he used to sit up right in there  same as I am now, like in a box  and the old chauffeur   was the chauffeur driving along."
And I suppose they go along about  I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.
"Just, chug, chug, chug, chug."
At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
Oh yes!
Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
Mm.
Er er er  er er er
"I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?"
Yeah.
Mm.
And when you see them racing on the television!
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Ah!
But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.
Now you see  in my days on the railway  sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di it didn't reckon to  do much more than that see.
"I know  er, down at Corfe Junction or a  one road across or one another across or  there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road."
"And of course, they had these signs up  about la up close to a signal  er  twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that."
"And er  I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and  he er  he said to the inspector, oh he says er  I've been through Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!"
What!
"Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!"
"But he said, I have done."
"And er  course, that where the restrictions was on see  at the  and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now."
Yeah.
and then someone scores and the guy goes in straight calmly and scores straight away.
You know it's people aren't
Yeah.
"I don't know, it's psychologically sort of still got their mind on going through what's er"
On what happened.
Yeah.
"It's like at school when they're thinking oh no, no and they've scored again."
"It's like you've scored, you're so elated and you"
Fact you you often sort of watch videos of managers.
"Managers are often shrieking you know about what's happening next rather than you know, all their players are jumping with joy all over each other and you think  and they're saying get in your positions."
Do your stuff.
"Don't let it slip straight away, I mean  That was annoying thing is that we didn't deserve to lose three one really, I mean"
Sneak that  that box of sweets in then for mum .
I bet she knows you've done that for her.
Eh?
I bet she knows you've bought that for her.
"Well she knows that we're giving her something, yes."
"I mean we could have been worse, could have forgotten completely."
"I mean it's easy, cos when mum gets all those things for everybody else, clearly she doesn't get something for herself."
Don't know why not.
What did you get her last year?
It was the same thing wasn't it?
"No I didn't get, we didn't do this did we, last year?"
Yes we did.
We always have the tree presents.
Do we?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
You what?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
Very stylish.
What's the time?
"Oh, buggery bollocks  you take yours anyway,get on"
"Erm, so   like all their ideas, on the erm, you know the ideas they were putting"
Yeah.
"were that in, in the borough there's lots of like fallen land, like, you know, Esher Common and things like that,"
Yeah.
"that they thought they could develop and hav hold events on, and er, he said, like we, we came up with some good ideas, put forward some ideas, really good ideas, for things to do on this land, and he said, the trouble is that all these councillors back on to these pieces of land, and he said, er, they don't want people coming along and enjoying themselves on it, because they want to go and walk their labradors on it."
"Oh, I see."
"So it might disturb their neighbourhood, you know, so they weren't very impressed with his ideas."
Ow.
"So er, he hasn't had a very good day at work, a bit fed up."
"But Alfie's coming down tonight, and they're going out."
Does he come down and visit quite a lot?
Yeah.
Does he?
"He's his partner in crime, as he calls it."
Do you think Maryanne's alright about that?
"Oh yeah, yeah."
All friends together as it were.
"Yeah, no, that's doesn't bother her at all."
"I mean, they've been on their own for weeks, so."
"You know, at the w they like to spend their weekends with everybody."
"Yeah, they don't want to section themselves off, obviously."
"I mean, Mike was like, you gonna stay down    and I was, I haven't seen anybody at college all week, so I think I'd better go back, actually."
"But erm, I did tell Maryanne if she wanted to go shopping tomorrow, I shall be around."
"Oh, God, yeah, I've forgot abo mind you Emily's coming back tomorrow, isn't she?"
Possibly.
But she might not be back till Sunday.
"Oh, I see."
"Do wh what do you, personally what do you think she'll do ?"
What Em?
Sunday I would have thought.
"Really, yeah."
day in day day out
True.
and it wasn't one of ours that dropped their whip
That's true.
out there so you know you can criticize .
Talking of the whip I mean we're only allowed to hit them five times over here.
In America they seem to hit them twenty five times
And in all sorts
everywhere they want to
anywhere they want to
Yeah
So  but there it's it's a very interesting point there because a lot of our young boys now the Dow Holland Alan Munroes are riding more the American style.
It's an interesting point.
I don't think he's right in what he says but I think it might have been a bit tongue in cheek as well.
They certainly weren't saying it about Lester Piggott on Royal Academy a couple of years back either.
No but I did say about it Lester Piggott on  a few weeks ago .
Yes.
Lester Piggott when he won on .
Mm.
And the next    .
Very good.
Very good impression.
Talking of Lester Piggott he of course was the winner of the first ever Channel Four personality of the year trophy which we awarded for the first time last year.
He was a guest on the morning line at Newmarket and there it is that magnificent  trophy which is valued at five thousand pounds.
Now we couldn't have him in this year to give the others a chance so this is how you voted for the nineteen ninety three racing personality of the year on Channel Four and let's take it in reverse order starting with the person who finished fourth.
In fourth place one of the hardest working and most successful trainers in Britain Jack Barry.
He polled nine percent.
In third place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing Peter Scudimore.
He polled eleven percent.
Runner-up the ever popular Willie Carson.
Willie received seventeen percent of the overall votes.
So who did you vote for?
"Mm, but, urgh."
"I got erm, three of those, erm, you know, those diet, sort of, erm, what they called, you know the yoghurts with the two dips bits in it, you know, three of those for ninety nine pence, in Iceland."
"Oh, that's good."
Mm.
"Yoghurts are expensive, aren't they?"
"They are, that's why I got that offer for three big ones."
"Actually, they did have six for fifty nine P in Iceland, but the date was up on them like, Sunday, and I thought, I won't get through all the them."
"Once they start going off  it's not really worth having them, so."
Bought me trusted cottage cheese.
"Some parsnips, some carrots, cucumber, onion, apples."
"Didn't get the  plates, I'm gonna get them tomorrow, it's too awkward to carry   but I generally get nothing exciting."
Just the bare essentials.
I've got masses.
Really.
"Like, I've got half a pepper, and a piece of cheese and some, some kind of sp spread."
spreads.
"Erm, a loaf of bread I'm sharing with Teresa."
"Two packets of Cuppa Soup, but I'm not sure that it wasn't Cuppa Soup, cos I've said to Thomas, I'm not  at the moment."
Really?
"Erm, so cheese on toast, and Cuppa Soup for you, then."
"Probably be nothing, actually."
"I eat, I went, when I went round to Maryanne and my  baked bread next door, I like I went down, I went in there before, before I went upstairs into the flat, and bought a, a roll for twelve P."
"Oh, yeah, that was good."
Mm.
"Soft roll, and then erm, I had a Viennese Whirl with it, and I sat and had that with my can of Diet Coke that dad bought a can of drink on the train this morning and never drank."
"Did you have lunch in a park, did you say?"
"Yeah, we had a piece of quiche,"
That was nice.
"and a hot chocolate,in this park in London."
"It was really nice, we had a good old drive around,"
Mm.
"Hampstead, erm, round Hampstead, round Highgate, had to drive up there, it's so nice."
Playing with me knobs.
Look hang on I've got one queu are you all right there Rachael?
Hello.
"Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street?"
No I don't actually cos I'm  nothing like her .
Erm
You look similar.
Well that's er that's a insult.
It's not.
It is.
Yeah.
I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually.
You were very pleasant.
"And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up."
Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company.
Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that
featured the last er three years some of the  other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator
experienced in running open topped tours around cities.
Could you hang on just a minute don't go away just stay there hold on.
Ah Rita.
Yes James.
Good.
Sorry about that
Still here.
What?
I said I'm still here.
You had to go off and make his nosh didn't you?
No I didn't he's in the kitchen being a very very domesticated husby and he's making own nosh.
He's not is he?
Yeah he is oh heck I've got to get the news in haven't I that worries me.
Well don't worry if you ask him nicely he might even make you a bacon sandwich.
Would he?
any financial commitment.
And it doesn't change the contract.
So I mean
B t t
"The reason why, no, the reason why these, these"
but they do.
procedures were written is because in the past we had that foggy situation
Mm.
Mm.
"and I wanted to clarify that, and make sure that our procedures actually were back to back with contract procedure."
"So I think in terms o of this particular erm procedure, we're okay."
Mm.
"Where, where we're not okay is in the point that Jim has raised, the general point and that is, what do we mean, what do we d define as a project engineer?"
So junior junior R Es then will not issue V Os.
Unless they're delegated t to do so within the contract and I rely on you to make sure that whoever is delegated to issue
"What if they're,wh what if they're below M S two level?"
No no.
No R E will issue a V O.
They might do if they're M S two I mean  the project engineer
If it's the project engineer.
Yes.
Yeah.
Fine.
specifications here Trevor?
With regards to?
On one two or
Yeah.
three?does it use the word th the term
No.
project engineer?
Definitely
not in the erm er in the M S ones.
"Yeah, right."
"Right, is there anything else?"
"So, yeah there is."
Erm  things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about?
I haven't done anything about that.
Right.
Erm
erm statutory undertakers?
Bus companies
Yes we'll need to write to all those and  we'll need to write  we need to write to the police
Yeah.
on  in two guises don't we?
Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn  partly because of the emergency services aspect.
Yeah.
"So we need to write to the police to er  I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police"
Yeah.
which is I think in Colwyn Bay
Yeah it is.
"and  but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm  traffic inspector at wherever it is."
I'm not sure
Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay?
What what
Just write to the Chief Constable.
I think we need to write three letters.
"One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade  just saying  we're proposing to do them."
Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites
Yeah.
and the dates are on.
Yeah we'll do this
But that's normal.
"general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm  once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know"
"Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates."
You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that.
Mm.
The kid hadn't done much
Get an extra two years for missing.
"the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt  serious ."
You know I had a moving traffic accident
Yeah
"wasn't trucking there, you know  or owt like that."
No sense of humour.
Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day.
Can you get the cogs off that?
Why?
Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine.
I don't think so.
Oh pity.
So what you've done to bend the wheel?
I haven't.
"The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel  and some compensation"
Scrounge the wheel!
How do you get them off?
He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools.
Ring spanner things with the
Mm.
keys on the outside  pumps and things on it to  I wouldn't bother.
A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid.
"A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on."
"Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you  you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on."
Mm   that fellow don't go to the police.
Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel  compensation
Unusual innit.
It's very expensive that's why it's unusual.
Sixty nine ninety nine.

"They all think that's like  he said they think oh stand up in the corridor, that's alright, Amy said  if you don't  if you have a holiday, you don't get no money"
Absolutely!
Well like they're

"that's what I said to Ron, I mean I've never known  I can't remember the last time I when I used to work for Colin for ten years  trying to get a holiday out of Colin was like trying to get blood!"
"Oh you can't have two weeks at once you know  but over there you gotta get rid of your holidays before December, you gotta get rid of them otherwise you lose them."
"Take them, you've got to get rid of them!"
Mm.
"In the end I couldn't get rid of them, I had two days off  when I was ill  and I had as holidays  to ge to get them  sort of settled up you know."
To get what?
That's like this woman at work
To get .
okay
"Hey bud, where you going?"
I was supposed to be going home
"Example a thousand pound  normally two and forty eight pounds, now only forty eight pounds"
What?
D'you think it's the wheel of fortune?
"Well it says it is, it's been"
It's a whole page spread  from such an established reputable company.
"All prices are fully inclusive of double glazing, grade one security p v c delivered ."
I don't know.
It doesn't say anywhere there's a guarantee  .
Cheshire.
I wonder if it's the same address as when we got ours?
Well we should have guarantee somewhere in the box there
"I mean it's it's, how long is it since it was supposed to have gone bust?"
Well it's years since I thought it had gone bust
I thought it was about ten years
Wasn't there somebody from  who got
I can't remember.
"When we got that, when we had ours and er they said if you if you found someone else who would like who would have  you would get seventy five pounds back and you gave the thing, who was it who was thinking about it?"
Was it erm what did they call?
Isabel?
Isabel?
.
Wasn't it her?
"It might have been, I can't remember"
Wasn't it just before or after her husband died?
It's been that long I don't know.
Her husband died when we were .
It couldn't have been that.
No.
Well I phoned Shirley and she said she's fine.
Yeah.
"if they don't, that's it."
"They don't come and look at your 'ouse, they come have a look at what they can do with it, you now, have a look like, why you got extension and,"
I don't mind beds being untidy and things like that.
No.
"I mean, you don't look at, your not, who's sleeping in your bed."
"When ours were, it was a right state when we looked at ours, but we still said we'd have it."
"Mind, it's just that, it's worth nowt as we've  name it."
We'll get it right one day.
"One day, Karen, one day."
When the moon comes up and it's in two.
When the
You got two moons.
"Yeah, all I wanted was go in and, now we're bankrupt and we're nowt where we are."
If we were well off we could get it done.
"You'd be employing, you'd be employing builders to come in and do it for you."
"Yeah, that's what I said, it'd be nice, wannit."
It would.
your half of next door to get some
"Remember, remember, if you want taking anywhere, it's er, is it four pound ten an hour  chauffeurs."
Yeah.
"What I mean you have to put petrol in, I mean, it doesn't"
"No, you have to put petrol in."
"Do you hell, not at four pound an hour."
Walk.
"One fifty an hour, driving."
"Ain't it four fifty an hour  chauffeuring, and he puts petrol in, and taxes and insures car."
Bugger off.
Back of the bloody van.
"You can't go in van with ya, with ya suit on, and"
"Oh, you've got to, you go play your part."
"You got to have a chauffeur, you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to make it worth me while coming off dole at forty pound a week."
That's just it.
"If we're to be, if we end up being audited on that, then we will fail the audit because we do not do that."
That's what I'm saying.
That is supposed to say what we do and what I'm saying is
Yeah.
we don't do that.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it I'm saying we don't do it.
Well I'll leave that for you to manage.
"And, and procedures procedures should not say what we don't do."
"I, I agree with you."
They should say what we do do.
Or .
Or what we ought to do.
Yes.
Oh no.
No.
No.
Ah!
If if we're not complying with the procedures that's a different
"Well it, I mean if we go down that"
a different ball game.
path er Jim then we're gonna have er five or six set different volumes of procedures.
Yes.
Because we all do things slightly different at present.
If that is necessary then that is of course what happened and indeed in many cases that is exactly what happened.
There is nothing wrong
You have a dif
with that.
"But, but, but"
you have a different quality system for different offices.
But Hughie is
"Well you, you have to do in some cases ."
You will
the reason why we're the reason why we're doing this now is is to
Right.
try and achieve that objective.
Mm.
Not t to drop it straight on them but to say.
"look, this is one we're introducing this is the way we in in intend to use it."
Mm.
"I mean there might be the odd situation, the big job, where the Q S would need to go and"
Right.
get involved in the measures on some of your work.
Well he doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.
He hasn't done yet.
"You can't have that, he doesn't."
Have a word with Dave  and ask him himself
Dave Dave was a party to this s
"D Dave, Dave wrote this"
procedure.
did the change.
Well you may be certain he didn't consult with me.
Yeah.
And that's the point I'm making.
Mm.
"These procedures should be manag you know part of management consultation, not part of the  Dave writes it, if he like says, well that's what we'll do for B E S, and then, and then I'm told, oh, that's what we do for B E S, I tell staff, and that causes a great deal of unrest in staff."
Hey Jim why?
Why
back on him?
Jim.
Cos I haven't had an opportunity to do it to
"Why should B E S be a different, a different situation from bridges or works?"
"Well in, in theory certainly probably there is no reason for it, but in practice, it hasn't happened yet this is the point."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two two
It is.
"It's, it's sort of following the demise of part of er Trevor's empire."
Thus making it even cheaper.
For to a smaller an empire.
"I should use that word, that was used very loosely that word  cheap."
What?
Cheap?
I mean  I'm briefed
on that.
Mm.
Okay.
So the urgent work procedure has now been removed to make life easier.
D two
And to let the client know where the job lies within our organization.
Good.
Given a point of
"Straight into a function and that function head will then s write to the client saying, I've got it."
"My project coordinator is Mr X, and then we've got the point of contact established straight away."
"There are quite a few fairly minor changes to the appointment contract procedure but I haven't, I don't pretend, intend briefing those because I think most people can read."
Right.
"So they should be aware there, there are some."
Yeah.
Right?
Er J two stop zero.
Trainees training report file.
Yes.
"Erm there is a requirement that all trainees and new starters within the group, who are having training reviews undertaken, will maintain a training file."
So they know where to find and we know where to find all their bits of reports and the like.
So we got money coming in.
Mm.
our Karen.
"But er, I mean, I says, can't we manage without him, can't you manage by yourself, but Colin says he can't really, because"
He needs somebody.
Yeah.
"Well, Colin's gotta be able to do a lot of office work, he's gonna be out doing quotes, you know what I mean, so he's going have to have somebody there."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Or I would apply for er, family credit straight away."
"get coming in, I'm gonna say, yeah, we've got ten thousand pounds."
"But we don't know how long it'll be, before get any money coming in, and if you go on to family credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our wages."
"So then, what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway."
Yeah.
"You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit?"
"It's got, it's gotta know what  increase, when you running a business."
Yeah.
"Oh, I don't know."
"If you apply for it straight away, could you say you don't know how much monies coming in."
How much money your gonna coming in.
"His dad's in a new business, anyway,bec so you should get forty quid a week at least, anyway."
"Thirty-five now,"
"Is it thirty-five,"
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
Yeah.
It's like everything else
"I mean, that's seventy pound, you wouldn't have had, anyway, ain't it."
No.
Oh.
"I ju I mean, it, now it's just getting me, more depressed than nowt else, I mean, I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah, we've got you a insured."
"And then, I mean, 'cos we daren't say that to accountant know, to have 'ouse valued, 'cos what's point in, I mean, anybody said to us, er, get it sent off, you'll find, you're, somebody will insure ya."
The other thing  I mean to be healthy  it's more important  to dry things and keep them dry for a while than to boil them.
Bacteria survive heat for a short time.
Yeah.
But they don't a for the percentage of bacteria that survives drought  is is minimal.
So you don't need to boil  logically.
"Er if you just keep your hankies  iron them, keep them dry."
"Then they are, then they are sterile."
be bothered.
"Anyway, back to the point."
He said pointedly.
Well  leaflet.
stall.
We've got to get back to the stall.
Yeah er the recycling leaflet.
Who's gonna do it?
It's not gonna be done if we don't get somebody to actually front you know
well
take it on
The  thing is that I  I can do  revamp it on computer.
Because it w you can scan
What ma manually?
No you just stick it on  a photocopier
I see I wa before you do that I'll get in touch with the guy who drew it and if he  if he has got  an original copy he might be able to erm to er
"What, what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out  type that out."
Ah.
"And then you just do a run, you don't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off."
That's one option
Then photocopy the rest of it.
I've got a laser printer yeah so I mean that's what I use for my business.
I've got a Mackintosh and a laser printer.
So I mean
I've got some recycled paper but but
But he's such a dork I'm taking him off it.
And they're letting him keep linear.
Cos linear is just consignment stock and you know  job there.
"Sally  the lass who's taken over the buying for precision bearings, is a great lass got on great with her, and Richard."
"And they want to come and see the factory, they want to go to  yeah, it fell down cos Richard was too busy at the end of last year, fine get that sorted and i Sally was dropped in the crap by  right at the end of last year, came on  five sets of bearings, I could've done 'em in two weeks."
"I said I'll get you in two weeks, wallop wallop  It's alright,to do it, they have 'em back in a month."
"We're alright you know, they only way you'll get the business, he's like that, he talks like that, is if you can you know offer a big price saving."
That I'm afraid that's one thing you can't do
Alright.
even if it means that this year Yeah yeah.
Er
From my own point of view I want the business but bearing in mind what's happening I'm asking you before I do anything.
Erm I
Should I let the dust settle first?
Yes.
So I'll leave it.
E you either either leave it or
"If I quote three or four quid underneath, he'll consider it and we may get an order in a few months time when the schedule runs out."
Do you want me just to leave it?
"I think what you could sensibly say, to them, is, Look, I gather you've had supply problems with"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos I was there when it happened.
And s n a look you won't have supply problems with us.
Mhm.
"And you could say, look what we've done with ."
Yeah
Competitors of yours.
Yeah.
"Competitors of yours, wanted bearings in a week, we got 'em bearings in a"
The problem the problem is that's happened with the design people.
Yeah?
Oh Melissa I'm
"guess what I was watching down there, ah P O R K Y S"
Porky's
"Alright, have you seen"
Have you been screwing that
alright
"have you seen, oh, have you got, don't tell me, something, something coat, my coat"
have you seen my coat anywhere?
"No, sorry love I'm not a lesbian"
Ah
Did he have a big balloon in his belly?
"Well, no, he had it struck over his head mind you"
Oh yeah
who was watching that with?
Well I was watching that with Steven
No word
"No word of a lie, or and the best part was when he stuck his tongue through the hole and they put soap on it and he"
Oh yeah
"and he stuck his dingaling through and the woman grabbed it and she put his foot against the wall and started stretching it, and he's going aaagh"
I've seen it and that and is
oh sugar plum
"I forgot, I got carried away  sorry about that missus"
"I forgot this erm microphone was on, sorry students, I am very, very sorry, please forgive me, please forgive me"
"They must think I was drunk, do you know what?"
What?
"Do you know when I went to Gareth's house and er, he had a you know a house warming party"
"and I was drunk, I think something happened"
"I don't want to hear about it, tell me another time"
"Well I'd like to say goodbye, cos Charlie's coming now, bye then, it's princess Diana, and you know what, I'm a stuck up old woman,oh Willie stop playing with those now"
"Da, da, da, da, da, hello I'm Marie Kelly, welcome to T V AM, where"
excuse me Mike I'm trying to say something
"Well today, poll tax has now gone up one pound, but for the old fogies it's gone down one pound"
So you've got  nine  plus four  Did we do a sample all day?
"No, just in the peak hours they're sampling."
Didn't we do them off peak as well?
We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we?
I don't know.
I mean Jan did those.
I think it was just peak hours.
Er   It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it?
"Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it."
Well I appreciate that.
"Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks"
Yeah.
"and then you, you"
You use the
cutback
"In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and"
I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour  is typical for the day as a whole.
That's not right is it?
Mm  maybe not.
Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you?
Mhm.
Mind you maybe you won't.
"Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic  split to left and right and  straight ahead isn't it?"
"If that pattern basically stays the same  then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down."
Mm right.
But if we did a full turning count how would we do that?
You can't do it can you?
It's not realistic.
You have to do  if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow.
Yeah.
And I've never done one like that.
"We've always  you know, found a way round it."
"well the phrase at the end, I'm just about get , but,"
Yeah
"get the phrase in the end, it's, what we've done is, at the end they go, they do a"
"rolling, rolling down the river, rolling, rolling, down the river, rolling, rolling down the river"
"and they, no, and they dropped  rolling, rolling  see what I mean?"
Oh yeah
"One, two and when you think, you think"
You want another one?
"Ooh I've got one another, it goes  rolling on the river  right"
yeah
yeah
no
"what I found very different, wrong with this"
"I mean you're like me, you want profession, you don't just come out and throw it, like that, you see"
"Oh we used to do one with erm the band, sometimes I'd get it right, others I wouldn't, but like you've just said they come"
"come up after and say, ah, that bit late for"
"I, but you did it for"
"Yeah, yeah, like I come down the other week and I"
Yeah
"I'm getting it, I'm getting over it very, very, very slowly"
"Here are, give us it back"
"I'm not being rude now, I've just come back from the Gambia and I haven't stopped"
"what you've just said now, and I'm gonna go now"
I don't know what the hell it is
"Oh well, I'll have to be careful, I don't know what er, what's, what happened"
"I said, I said to them, oh I hope he don't think I'm"
"but I said because you bring some guy, you'll lend me the room on a Sunday afternoons, up and down"
"you know, put the whistle on, and then bring them up and that'll be me"
"Yeah, I"
"I like do the Tom and, I won't, Tom and Jerry, I might do the Tom Jones one, cos I, I feel comfortable at"
Which I don't
You don't have to be beautiful
"turn that handle, see you later then"
"No I want a pound, lends us a pound Jo"

"I haven't got any money Neil, I just told you"
Ah?

It's not mine either
Just give me your change then
I haven't got any change
"Well, how, your coppers, you must have a pound tucked away somewhere mum, mum"
"Have a game of something Neil, then you won't have to go into town will you?"
Not staying here with you  just because you're bored I ain't
I'm not bored
Eh?
Shut up parrot
me a pound after what I've just done for you out there
Oh wowee
I didn't have to help you
"No you didn't, but you did"
er how often has it not
"You won't get any money, go away"
I only want one pound
Why?
then then reshape the inside.
Yeah.
Er something before I I always forget everything.
The German Friends of the Earth's people told me never to do the washing on Monday mornings.
I mean that's something to put there as well I think.
Because  it's a peak time for electricity and the Electricity Board  er produces according to peak demands.
That's got nothing to do with recycling has it?
No.
I know but
No.
But you do you think honestly though that that really does still hold true because if everyone ha mostly having automatics now you just wash as you go you don't have a washing day or is it specially Monday they
Like I've got just automatically I wanted to do washing this morning.
Really?
I don't.
"I just put it, when it gets too bad you know if haven't got any clothes to"
It's an interesting though.
I didn't know that they produced according to peak
"Yeah, I think it's important to know"
"It's very important to know, yes."
erm  whatever.
Don't do it Monday mornings.
I usually do mine at midnight when I get home!
Yes.
A lot of people do it overnight
Yeah.
but it's not really a good idea because if something goes wrong with your machine
you're not there to deal with it.
I mean I've had mine flood and I've had its thermostat go and it boiled everything.
I mean that would have been a disaster I mean it's only because I was upstairs and I thought oh I can smell boiling.
You know it was like when you boil up hankies I thought what a!
. There was dye came out of everything it was awful.
And another time it was all pouring all over the floor
"It's a way of life, they've lived together that long, like, they don't want to"
"If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she would have left Pete."
I know.
"But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with, was why should I, why should I leave me home and sell up, she said, when all my life, he's had money from the house."
"He'll have the money from the house, plus a wage every week."
"She said, and what will I have, she said, just the money from the house."
"She said, and where do I live."
"You know, he can move back home with his mum, she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum, well then I've got to look for a job, you know."
Mm.
And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete.
Yes.
"Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a wage every week."
Yeah.
"You know, and she worked all them years, and then when she weren't working, she have no money coming in every week."
"Yeah, but she's got all the shares."
"She hasn't, she got rid of them all."
"Aye, not with Bl not with"
"Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that, I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week."
Yeah.
"We'll he had his money he won't have to touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week."
"Oh, aye,"
And he could start again.
Find another woman and buy another house and start again.
Mm.
"I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're not happy."
"They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's he's"
"They've got to do, aren't they, I mean, after all bloody  harm they caused."
"Yeah, you know, you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is."
Yeah.
He's another one.
"But you see when he living with Ange, maybe he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were living with Ange, he had all the women as you know, plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had everything, there was Kay,as well, weren't he, now he can't."
No.
"and er, like Christmas, erm, they have these things on the telly when there's about, every, every night there's like a fifteen minutes' programme, just before the close-down, of like, B B C One."
One?
"And there's people, like famous people of the telly just sitting and talking erm, and saying prayers every night, and walking around a typical area that means something to them."
Oh.
"And we watched it one night, and it was Mrs Hewitt off Eastenders."
"Oh, really?"
"And er, she was really"
"by Michael Aspel, weren't she, or Michael Parkinson?"
between them.
Yeah.
Aspel tomato.
"Erm, and so, we had a good old walk around there, and like this place where she was, I swear it's Highgate Cemetery where she was talking,"
"Oh, really?"
"and like she was pointing different things out about this cemetery, and, I mean, you know, you there can't be many cemeteries"
No.
"like that in, in London and she was in London, but we missed the beginning of it,"
Oh.
"and erm, mum was sorry that Mark had been on about it, she said, oh I bet that's where he goes, and erm, like the park beside it was just lovely,"
Yes.
"the whole thing, really, really nice area, and er, all just minutes away from central London, you know."
Oh.
"It was, it was really good."
Had a really nice three hours.
And er
Oh that was nice.
"Then he's gone off to Coventry, and then over to Manchester."
"So er,"
It's quite  to get on with your bruv .
"Yeah, because you know, we're always messing about, or  around, or, you know, never like you know, together, really"
Yeah.
"Because even when I go up to his place, like it's always been, like dropping him off, always being in a hurry."
"I mean, I sat in his room, had a coffee today, it was like, I actually sat here and relaxed and always being on the move, you know."
You're not supposed to know .
"Oh my, I'm not supposed to see."
Switch it off now for a few minutes.
Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.
The  worm.
Look at these flowers!
So these are lovely!
Mm mm.
Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.
Hmm mm.
Why is it pure gin?
I think Ted would be proud of me.
"Well, my stars say   if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry."
Every so often we all need to wind down.
There you are.
"If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign."
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities .
Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?
I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.
Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
"The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm."
"If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love."
"In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think."

"Yes I would care for when I had to do something, rather than just go straight into that, good"
Giggle
"Giggle, mm, we know all about that don't we?"
I giggle when somebody
I giggle when somebody
erm
"no if you say giggle you're actually saying the present tense, so giggles"
Giggles
"giggles would be better, because it sounds as if they've already chosen"
"we all have a giggle, yes it can be a giggle until, if you're using giggle and a giggle what sort of word is it?"
"a noun, yeah, if you use giggles, then Ashley what sort of words is it then?"
"What, oh dear, oh"
"It's not an oh dear word, no"
It's a verb
Erm  the alchemist is conning people promising them that he'll turn base metals into gold.
"One of the people he's conning is Sir Epicure Manhom  who wants a life of ease and luxury and has been giving  the alchemist loads of money in order to tu to, to perfect this  and  funny enough the alchemist hasn't managed, hasn't managed to do this, to get the person's money."
Okay.
So that's who Epicure Manhom is.
"One day, when he is, somewhere back in act two, one day he is visiting the alchemist he catches sight of this woman, Doll, quite obviously a prostitute, probably an a an absolutely  erm  catches sight of her and says, I must quickly think up some reason why this woman is, is in the house  cos  Sir Epicure Manhom thinks the alchemist is a pure, homely  er priest-like creature yet in fact, he's running a whorehouse."
Okay?
"So,has it's worse than Neighbours ."
"Erm, think  erm  so he's sort of bluffing, okay?"
I'll just find a scene where he does this.
"Er er  in act two, scene three  okay?"
"Er erm  quite a long way, there's that, that line  erm  two twenty."
Okay?
"Face had just realized that Sir Epicure Manhom has  erm  seen Doll, which he shouldn't have done, and  Manhom calls Face out and says stay Lungs."
That's what Face is called at the moment.
I dare not Sir.
Say man what is she ?
Now Face is bluffing here.
A Lord's sister sir.
", pray thee stay ."
And he sort of bluffs a bit more.
She's mad sir .
"Still trying to explain why a Lord's sister is staying with the alchemist, okay?"
She's mad sir.
"Send hither, he'll be mad too."
"I warrant thee, why send hither?"
"Sir, to be cured ."
"You know, he's, he's thinking on his feet."
"He's trying to find reasons for this, this woman to be in the house."
"Meanwhile Sottle off stage is more, is calling why rascal?"
And Face  low you hear sir ?
He's going out to spend some .
Okay.
It's been at the Playhouse in past years though.
"Oh, well maybe."
"No, it wasn't, wasn't at  last year was it?"
Was it?
Well last year I did it at Latton Bush .
"Well what, what's the date?."
The seventh.
The seventh of March.
"Erm, so that's going to be before our next meeting isn't it?"
"So erm, if anybody wants to help contact me  ."
"Yes, what time, how much is, how much the day is it all day?"
I haven't any details either than what she said .
No .
"Erm, shall we erm see, what shall we do about this, it's Saturday the seventh of March, on a Saturday"
As I say I'll take a stall and I'll be there all day if anyone can help me.
"Right , well perhaps I, perhaps people could as actually come and speak to me afterwards, if they, if they think they could help at all, that's International Women's Day and all the local organisations have been asked to take part"
"Certainly , it's, it's for your ."
It was quite good last year.
"Yes, and we could sell our products and that's sort of thing."
"Yeah our things ,."
And that's a good way of advertising our .
"Mm, right, we've got a list, ah, you probably know, there's a list, a list isn't there, of, of sort of sale products, have you had that at all?, thing that came with us, with your, with ."
No .
"Yes I got it, but you may not of had it."
"I will pass it on, I will pass it on to you."
"We, we sell quite a lot of Amnesty products, a lot, a lot of clothing in every"
on tonight.
Yeah.
"Tee-shirts and er sweat shirts and all sorts of things so we can take them along, so that's, that's Saturday the m , seventh of March, if you think you can help at all see Avriel afterwards."
have you got a date?
"Yeah, got a couple."
"Anything you  we got some of those things, tell me, I'll bring it along  ."
Do they need to do the  they've proposed that they  to bypass erm  if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
Well it doesn't say that.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
responsibility not
Yeah.
theirs if they put the bypass in.
"So what came out of this, well it could be"
So are they looking to build a bypass first?
The gut reaction this morning is we could end up  with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link.
Oh that's no good is it?
Of course it is.
Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link .
four percent fee .
"Mind you it's, it's a smaller job."
What's smaller?
"Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway  on the Richard  principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway."
If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough.
So they're serious
"Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this"
so they're seriously looking to  the trunk road network coming down  bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass?
Or is that just
That wasn't er  Ray  's view.
That was this other guy's view.
Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes.
"But which,whi which other guy?"
This Ve Vernon whatever his name is.
The  are proposing this.
They won't want that.
They wo they won't
But the  the guy that's looking after the  schemes
Yeah.
I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
"Eighty gardens, oh  made me laugh."
"Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens."
"Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be"
"Well I expect now, they've got about five ."
"I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty"
"Oh look,tractor  ."
I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
Mm.
And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
Mm.
But if they can use that er beautiful water
Ah right.
"to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well."
I know a lot of people say they shouldn't
Good idea .
"have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go."
"Yeah, I agree, if people did ."
"I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right,were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful,palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of  is it?"
.
"It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?"
What Buckingham Palace?
Mm.
"I don't know, I didn't realise."
"At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building"
Mm.
"and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than"
Well that was Buckingham Palace was er .
Oh yes.
.
Oh yeah.
.
Yes.
I'm finding something totally wrong with   and got shot of it  and then things have been
"Well actually he didn't, but he says"
worse  thinking he'd been to solicitors  but I'm trying to track down anybody!
Just trying to get some information.
Apparently  oh my God tha they're that much within the law.
"Yeah, that's what we've been told."
"They must have a legal section cos this is one of the biggest organisations,leisure group in Britain"
Yeah.
for caravans.
"They, they, they,they own"
They're going to clear themselves aren't they?
You clear you!
More than that!
Apparently
They're not going to
"one man told me, he said"
"well if you think you might get some money at the end of the season, he said, you may find that you'll be paying them at the end of the season!"
"I mean, what's the good of it?"
"Yeah, you see!"
Well we may as well have got that money and thrown it down the toilet!
Gone straight in the bin!
Well that's right!
"Straight away this year, you get a list through  now, do you want winter cleaning done, curtains cleaned,"
Yeah.
"carpets cleaned, upholstery cleaned?"
"Or outside valet, do you want the underneath painted with grease and everything?"
I say we did have it done.
By the time you add all that up  if you're not local.
All your profit's gone!
You'll  you will end up paying them!
Yeah.
to be made out of recycling
Well  well this is what
Well at the moment it's so dear
well what he meant was
to
"th , I mean he said they"
process it.
we are not
Well
we are not dealing with anything that we cannot
In the short term.
sell.
In
Ah.
"other words they were selling glass, and they were selling  metal  back to  whatever  and manufacturers  to re-use  but  in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and"
That's expensive!
"handling all this it's, yeah."
The cost that they were  having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
"But, at the same time  the  normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable  was being reduced  because"
That's right!
these other items weren't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a
Well that's if
"fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that"
Well that  er
But not saving to these
that's if
particular firms
that
that they want.
that's if
No.
Mm.
Great stuff.
So what's the trick to the solo on there?
"I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just"
stuff's no problem but er once it starts  and get the medium stuff done as well
And there's the bit
so that when he gets up
"three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong."
"And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too."
Och it might be  I dunno  it might be with you bending it  that there's a bump on that string.
"Yeah on the, that's a thought,"
I think
Yeah.
But th it's something wrong with
It looks real good with
"That's what I thought, I thought you know fuck  looks like a bloody comic shop for a change."
That's why I stuck all the posters here   think the back issues  loosening up a bit it was getting pretty tight.
Nine hundred series.
"Well okay   Anyway I thought they'd ring here but  couple of people, some, two women   I thought it was Belfast Station"
New window display and everything.
The big guns and the big guns  I found a use for the fucking thing.
That looks good actually    I thought you'd be practising like mad  on your day off.
No.
I was playing last night   Gotta learn this  album I used to have ages and ages ago   fucking .
"I was really annoyed last night, I was getting really     There was all this like down tuning and up tuning like all over the place    That looks like Bart Simpson's dad"
Mm yeah.
got the hair
Probably
What is it?
Going to  tonight.
Are you?
I thought you'd given that up.
"No, back on again."
"Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other."
Oh bring them home then.
Bring them home and tell them that you're taking them home to air.
"And I don't suppose, they're not wet  you see."
"It's different  it's, they're damp  it's different if there'd been a hole and the water was coming in."
They're not saturated.
No.
It won't take them long.
That's what I says.
If those men wasn't working there I wouldn't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low
Mm.
and the atmosphere would warm up  right through the caravan.
Mm.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday
Mm.
"and done their work  and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday  the caravan's great now, the fires are alright."
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Mm.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ain't got the keys.
Cos they're not going to take an awful long time in a good hot room  to dry.
"the only thing again that I'm thinking of  what if we gets them out of the caravan  and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here  and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?"
Well if we rip them we rip them and I'll mend them.
Mm.
They are yours aren't they?
Mm.
Put a patch on them.
"Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said."
There's nobody can sleep in those.
"Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said  erm  yours was erm  the driest of them sort of thing."
Suppose they didn't bother with them.
Well Dave'll be down there today.
"Well not you can't pay on the night, can you?"
Well I suppose   I'm sure Adrian won't mind if I paid him  the day after or a week after or something.
"You're unemployed I wouldn't have thought you could've stood a hundred and fifty, two hundred pounds withdrawal."
No I don't mind  saying it I I'm not gonna ask any more.
What?
Well so that yo about Adrian  after a few weeks it's  you know
Remind me to wash in these cupboards before Sunday.
Yeah.
"Have you seen Jan and Joan dress up to their their Victorian day  Jan came like a an upright stripped  erm working, not working class a sort of governess right she had"
Yeah.
frumpy shoes and a .
Where'd she get the clothes from?
"Oh she borrowed it, and a bonnet and a  white flowers an all and Joan turned up like a  a twenty five year old Victorian fashion model  you should have seen her!"
Black silk skirt  maroon  blouse  her hair done up in a bun  draped with gold jewellery oh  talk about looking the part!
What's wrong with that?
And John hired this thing like a cape
Who's idea  is it?
Was it?
"Oh it's it's quite common, everybody does it if you have a vic if you study Victorians anyone who a Victorian   and they all they did all done out, chairs er table space at the front, they did drill in the playground  they played with tops and hoops in the playground, all the children  the m parents hired costumes from Fairy Godmothers  Fairy Godmother's done a roaring trade especially"
"Ah I should think Fairy Godmothers put the ideas into somebody's head, I would have thought."
That's not
We might
It's just a very good way of er teaching chi I mean children will I mean that's the kind of experience
Yeah.
"you never forget, do you?"
Some of  but you can't do it for something like a Medieval's day or Roman
No.
"day it'd be grim, but Victorian"
Victorian
"people have got a, yeah"
just close enough to sti still remember a lot of the cloths and stuff.
"Oh right, right, just so it's just mum and dad we're ."
Oh I need some money.
I want to believe it.
Now one of these in the morning and one at tea time.
"Twice a day, for the next week."
"One, two, three, four."
"Tell your mum she could be kinder to you, she's got to  for"
even though she's  already.
"Right oh, okay, bye Mrs ,"
Right
cheerio now.
up and call me now  A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse.
Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs.
Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it?
Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O  never mind you know the number.
Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals.
More specifically why we're so cruel to them.
Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics.
Why do we hate animals so much?
If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call  now  sorry.
"Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on?"
She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning.
What are you on?
I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are.
Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel.
But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed.
Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas.
The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan.
"Is this Alan Oritt, Alan?"
Correct yeah.
OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too.
it's too much isn't it?
"But like erm  my mum was saying, you know  she's like  she's  got a, definitely got a good job and like, the kids really sort of"
"You get, are you alright?"
Comfortable?
Yeah.
"sh , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and  goes to school and whatever!"
"But like erm  she said like, he's a really good kid."
Well
Mm.
"I mean  well I thought to myself, God what a life!"
"I mean, I know it's not her fault  but like, every Wednesday she has  all the people from the college bridge  go to her house to play bridge."
I mean the kid's
Poor kid!
just sat there on the sofa!
"I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever?"
"But like, I mean  God, do you know I'd really hate that!"
"I mean, I used to hate it with like  having  flipping  anyone come up to our house when I was little!"
Yeah.
"I remember, I remember once"
Apparently his mum's hardly there!
"Because  the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right  she said she doesn't mind doing  Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays  as well as the weekends  but she doesn't wanna do every day  each week."
"Ma , how much does she go out?"
"I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him!"
Yeah!
I mean  ooh!
"That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum  you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like  they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights  and she said, like  unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go  which is the reason I'm doing it."
So like
Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
"Yeah  say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know  it's too bad sort of thing!"
"So I think I'm gonna change my nights  this, of staying in  to either Mo , Monday and Wednesday or  Tuesday and Wednesday  something like that."
I don't know really!
"But like, like erm  that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to  mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?"
"I told her off for not let not telling us she was ill and she said no, no I'm fine."
She's got her friend Sandy staying with her
When's Gareth back?
"He was he was in the house, I didn't speak to him though."
I just spoke to Shirley.
"Erm, Sandy's staying with her for a few days."
What else did she say?
Did you say about us going down or not?
"No, I didn't mention it, at the moment."
She's got Sandy staying now
"I asked her about the letter and she said she couldn't remember anything about it but she filled in something when they came back from Belfast and she said open it, so I opened it and it's one of these things er if you book to go to Dublin before May the whatever, the end of May, then if you went again in the Autumn, you you get er fifty pounds worth of vouchers or something, you go half price."
It's one of those con things like they tried
"Well,"
"Yes,wh why, I mean why would she go to Dublin"
Dublin
before.
What else?
And why Dublin when i when they were
When they crossed from
when they crossed from Northern Ireland?
I don't know.
Cos they're trying to sell things all the time.
"Anyway, she doesn't want it."
Martin still hasn't got his erm invalidity pension sorted out but he's managing alright at the moment.
He's filled in all the things.
I forgot er I haven't watched the television at all and I forgot to record what d'you call that thing? with the devil in it?
Well it was half way through when I came in
I forgot to I know I forgot to record it for you.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight
Does that rain mean it's off the coast or it's in our area?
And was that minus one just the Western side or us as well?
We'll get to know better with the local news after this
And I should imagine that the  light paper's the backing paper and that I've already glued my work on the   paper and my  my picture is already glued just there.
Can I have my sellotape back?
And I'm now drawing
Sorry.
a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the  work being put on.
Right this is a  decorative line round the sides of .
Does that make sense?
Just a white line.
Now you can make that look even smarter by making a second white line on the outside.
And then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border  for the second line  over the top of it which makes it thicker.
So you've got a thin white line on the inside and a thicker white line on the outside.
That's point one.
"Point two is this, that I made the bottom border there  er  about  be exactly five centimetres."
And I'm going to  put a guide line which is one erm er half  a centimetre from the side there .
"Yes Christine, can I help you?"
I've put two very  faint white lines there in white.
"You could use ordinary pencil, are you alright Bruce?"
Have you lost something?
Aye I was just
You then write your name in block capitals.
What's your name?
Jane?
J A Y N
?
Yeah.
"So imagine you were writing Jayne here  J  now it's a very long name, Jayne  and you have to put the title on there too, so I couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could I?"
"Probably that was a little bit on the, the large side anyway so  I would use lower case as well on this one, a bit like, a bit like junior school writing."
Do you know what I mean?
Then it'll fit on very easily.
You have to use your common sense.
"But you can see how a white pencil on that paper, that's going to look quite smart."
"Without, without the picture."
And the more people that know what good work we do the better.
Provision of photographic services.
Over to you my friend.
Oh.
Provision of photographic services?
Right.
"Erm just to say that, just to confirm the note sent round that erm we will only pay for any photographic services by Intercity East Coast if it has been procured using a task request form in accordance with the same way we procure any other internal B R er service."
Now.
Surely if all we want is prints off existing things all you need do is a request with a DOPACS number?
Yeah.
Surely not you know fill in a task form in for print off a couple of negs.
Is this the external
Yes.
request request for external
Mm?
services?
Well.
B b w w why?
Why can't you just use a task request form that says.
Please p
Well.
I mean
please provide
Prints off the following negative numbers
"four number eight by eight prints off these t off, off negative numbers so and so."
Splendid.
Are you gonna write
And put the DOPACS number on.
You're gonna on something.
Yeah.
Copy it to Andrew  and then Andrew knows when the I B I S invoice comes forward that it's something to be
Then he'll sign it off.
Now we're gonna be  using acid  very very dilute acid.
Nevertheless we have to take proper precautions.
"So, if you would be so kind as to get into a position where you can see what I'm doing without being too close  it means that if we do splash any acid by accident er the likelihood of it causing any problems to anyone are minimal."
Have you come to  supervise Miss  's class?
As it happens it would seem that most of those children are out on an English trip.
Oh.
Perhaps you would like to go and do your own thing.
Perhaps you'd like to stick around and watch this happening because I remember you subbing once for an etching lesson.
Oh it's an etching lesson is it?
Yes can you remember?
Yes
Yesterday wasn't it?
And you thought well I'd better not
I'm not having them running around .
That's right.
I remember you saying.
So perhaps you'd like to  keep them right
Have a .
and make sure I do it right.
But on the other hand if you
I don't know how to do it .
Oh well I meant from the point of view of .
Safe safety point of view.

"Come on, come on, throw them over there."
"I wonder if there's any way you can actually check, you know, where he is, is there any way that"
"Watch me tea, now."
"straight out, or,"
"Well, what what do you think erm,"
Are you worried about how much money it's gonna cost ya.
"No, because money's cost us less."
"Er, you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er, administration and search and survey."
"It's come back, and it's under two hundred."
"Can I have a cup of tea, please."
Then they said I've got to pay five hundred pounds for
"Do what, love."
I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with anybody that's dodgy.
No.
"Er,"
"Now, watch that tea."
Yeah.
That's what he said.
Are you ready.
I don't think they'd deal with anybody that dodgy.
Er.
Bert.
"Are you doing alright, are ya."
"What they do, they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied Dunbar are doing."
"Well, well, this is a broker, but it's a  broker, so that's"
Yeah.
"You see, what it is, it's where they've been behind with their mortgage, we will pay a slightly higher rate, but it's only"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I said do you, do you think there'd be any discount  er with it being a block booking?"
"And she didn't say no full stop, she said oh she said I'm not sure she said, I'd have to enquire about that."
"So  I just thought she's gonna  yeah if it was out of the question she could have said oh no that's it, there's a flat rate so I"
Yeah.
think she's gonna ask
thing is with them Welshies they probably haven't tried to bloody  they haven't got the sense.
No.
"If somebody else was trying to book it, one of those Welshy types, they haven't got the sense to  ask"
"No, I said well I said that  I'd appreciate it cos it's worth a go and she said oh yes I agree with you there."
Which field's Min in?
Not any of these.
So that was good.
Ooh  I can't stop yawning.
"So then I thought oh I'll go and find  er the  offices again, Church Street."
"And we'd gone a roundabout way the last time we were there and I thought oh I'll give it a go, anyway I walked straight down this road, have a look oh yes, turn up here  anyway I, I sort of got me bearings and I thought oh yes it's just down here  he's in the field just down there."
Is he?
Do you wanna go or not or go straight to your nan's?
"Go straight to nan's, call on the way back."
If it isn't too late.
Couldn't see him.
"Erm  so I went straight to this place and there was a fella downstairs, his secretary was  erm out on her lunch."
"Anyway I said oh  I said you're not expecting me, said who I was and where I was from."
"I said I called in to see either Michael or the secretary, Mirelda her name is."
Mm.
And er so he said alright.
"I said I'm also gonna be che cheeky and see if I can use your toi he said oh yes he said, go and help yourself he said there's a kettle down there, make yourself a drink, make yourself at home."
So anyway I thought I won't have a drink cos if  this secretary wasn't there I didn't know how long she'd be  so er but I di I went upstairs to where we had the meeting with Mike the other week.
And erm  Joe his partner was there so I had a really good chat to him.
What do you mean his partner like?
Is it just like a little firm?
And this Michael's one of the partners in the firm?
Yeah.
Subtract them that way round.
They'll go out.
"And we've got three point one squared, minus"
Two point nine squared .
Two point nine squared .
Mm.
"Which will come to, if we add them it's six times nought point two."
The gradient will be one point two.
That's a bit better because a gradient of one is forty five degrees and we s we said it should be more than that.
Erm  one point two.
Find out which ang what angle has a tan of one point two.
Tan minus one .
One point two.
Fifty.
Fifty.
"So you were, you were closer to seventy."
"You see how hard it is to see just from the graph, from a, from"
Mm.
"a sketch, if you plotted it on paper, but this is without plotting it, we're getting it quite accurately."
"Erm  maybe someone says it could be useful for you to try it again, without any help from this page at all."
"So we've got Y equals X squared, minus one."
And we want the gradient at the point where X equals three.
"But we want to get very very close to it, like only nought point nought one before it and nought point nought one after it."
So what value would ?
Around the point where X is three.
Erm so you'd need  nought in the middle.
"No, I'm not thinking of drawing a sketch at the moment, we've done the sketch on the other page"
Ah.
"and we're just thinking of  what value are we going to, what would be the value of X point nought one before three?"
Er two point nine nine.
Okay.
"Oh well, according to that it's cloud."
"At least it's a white cloud, not a black one"
Did you see your mother?
"No but I get a message, will you tell my brother, no don't tell my brother, they said, she said to one of the nurses and they said, your brother?"
"No, my son."
I said well what did don't you have to tell me?
"She said, we're not gonna tell you."
So I didn't get to know what what they didn't have to tell
Oh.
What was she doing tonight?
I don't know
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
Sally was quite intrigued by that
We'll have to get her a set of books.
"There's some bottles, jars, for the bottle bank as well"
"You know the last time you  the erm, the last time you missed the television pages, television supplement in the  out of the Mirror."
I don't think they believed me.
And it's erm it'll be twice in a month and Chris is back again as our paper boy.
The other one was so useless but according to the er that new manager in the paper shop everyone else got theirs.
So I said I'm sorry but I'm not included in everyone else and he gave me one.
The Radio Times?
Why?
Because it's got all the
Ah.
Are we staying up all Thursday night?
"Well, it's up to you ."
"Of course, well you could stay in bed all day on Friday  And I could take the kids to schools and go back"
"I need to go, I need to go into the Co-op and Iceland."
What shall I get for your mother?
I'll get some chocolate biscuits I think.
"You would think she would put on a lot of weight, wouldn't you?"
Let's hope he gets off the floor.
"walking across roads a risk, ain't it."
Yeah.
It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it.
"It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power."
I got
"I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all."
"I can tell you that, now."
Oohh.
What?
Oohh.
"You feel like  er, that's whose, like ex soldiers  throughout the company, and he said to Colin er, he said, how many people are you thinking about employ , our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he says, he says, well how many people are you thinking about employing, he says, only only me and me  like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work to keep two of going, he said, I thought you employed about six."
"So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em."
"Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker"
"Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya."
Yeah.
That's it.
"He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but  the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose."
"Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it."
"There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford,"
Yeah.
round about here.
"Mind Lee's a, Lee's a good worker, he says that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can"
"Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm."
Yeah.
"You know, I mean"
"Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working with him when he were at er  over in Brad oh, here's Richard now."
"Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him,"
"Oh dear, no but he is, Richard is the one with the  comical magazine,laughing bursts two incomes."
I think that's part of
Yes.
"Look, slow down, or you're driving me mad."
"No, would you tell me what sort of word it is remembering what we did at the beginning of the week"
"yeah, but that's the, what it means, I want to know what kind of a word it is"
Yes I know it's spelt
Is it a verb?
"No it's not a verb, come on, what is it"
A noun
"Yes it's a noun, it's a name of something isn't it?"
"Because we were doing that at the beginning of the week, a scare, you could actually get"
"right, so can you put it back into, into a sentence again then"
Shirley?
"You've got a scare on, I saw Dracula"
"We've got a scare on, we saw Dracula, yes, that was it."
Right what's the next word?
Share
"Share, what does share mean?"
You share out
"You share out, can you put that in a sentence?"
I like to share out my sweets
"Oh that's lovely, I like to share out my sweets"
digging
"Digging, they're going onto double Gs now, why would it be double G?"
One put dig and then and then -ing
"Yes, but there is a rule isn't there"
Oh yeah
"Ah yes, Trevor"
"because, because, is it cos of erm, if you put D"
"no, not quite, you're nearly right, come on"
Is it because the I sounds like
"yes you would actually get, a magic E right, or a magic I making that vowel right say its long name, so it would be quite difficult to say dig giding"
"Right, lets try the next one, what's the next one?"
er bigger
"bigger that's for the same reason, there you've got an E, and so because you've got the E we can double the G to make the I go on, go on say short for"
And did you
"So erm  I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's  reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music."
"So I thought, oh maybe I'm  reading too much into it."
"So I met him on Wednesday evening  Tottenham Court Road tube station  and er  chat, chat, chat."
"He, he talked so much we missed our stop."
In a very loud voice!
Did you?
Yes.
"Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!"
Oh oh!
"Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on"
Oh yeah.
"that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him  and I did not fancy him in the least  erm, it really made my skin crawl."
"And erm  first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching"
Mm mm.
"and moving away, like, hint, hint."
"But he liked gripped me on the arm and then  his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?"
. Oh it was just a nightmare!
"I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this."
"But, you know  I think it, I thought it was his  dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath."
"It was, I don't know how it smelt"
of moth balls.
"And he kept guffaw and going,"
and get this awful blast of moth balls !
Really?
"It was, it was a complete nightmare !"
Oh.
"And I, I wasn't prepared"
I wasn't prepared for   for it at all
Go on.
"because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving  and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?"
"And I pulled away and I said, well erm  I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it."
And the bus left at a quarter past eight.
Hour and a quarter.
I could have travelled home.
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
"Honestly, it was just sitting there, we were just not moving."
"Well, you probably know what it's like, I was just sitting there."
"Is it, is your parking permit saying what college you're at?"
"Yeah, I have to."
"I'm not allowed to park in their colleges, other colleges."
See what I mean?
Yeah.
So I can't drive there
Said you can't get on the bus either .
No.
That's what I said.
"Well, the good thing is, where Southlands is, which is on the south  which is a very nice area."
"Well, it's not that nice, but there's a hell of a lot of little roads, all around it, it's not a like Roundtree is, is it?"
"It's just on a little main road, but it's situated almost in this housing estate."
"They must say, God they must get pissed off with it, so I've already looked around, and there's loads of parking places,"
Mm.
"there's no yellow lines, there's loads of little roads."
That's true.
"I mean, I could park it there, if Nicole didn't want to drive."
"But the, the bus, the erm  staggered."
"You got a bus at eight fifteen, and you got another bus at one o'clock, and you got another bus at three o'clock, and another bus at six"
You serious?
"and, and if you wanna come home, there's supposed to be a bus at half past four, and our lecture finished at quarter to four, so you like, three quarters of an hour to get to the bus, right, and then it didn't turn up."
"So we had to wait for the next bus, which was six o'clock."
Oh no.
It's a long time.
"We were sitting like this, sitting on the pavement, with our umbrellas up"
Oh!
in in a will or something
Yeah.
so they have the house and move into house
Then they pay a lot
but they're gonna taxed so heavily that they can't afford to live in it  under this new tax!
They've just gotta sell it!
I thought well  how  what a bloody shame!
Terrible isn't it?
"Mm  I mean er why don't they do it on like the square, how big your house is because that way you could  I know it's not far when  people who live in a great big old house  don't have to pay as much cos if this  I mean Uncle Trevor and Aunty  they've got a massive great house  haven't they?"
Have yeah.
But if this  because it's old or something they don't have to pay so much   the
the
rates
"The rates, yeah."
you know?
Yeah.
"But if you only went on the square foot it don't matter how big it was  well that's like, surely that'd be fairer?"
That's right  it wasn't
"Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have  don't have actual  they haven't got money  but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property ,though it don't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?"
If
No.
"you've got no money  we haven't got any money  but, you know"
Doo doo doo doo
I mean why should I I
Why should you be condemned just because you've put your money into your house?
"Yeah that's right, I mean some people don't"
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now .
Yeah.
Oh!
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you don't get taxed on that
Phone!
"Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it?"
"And it's only an hour or so away, so  perhaps you should say that"
get a weekend in
I wonder where there is a cheap place to
where you can old furniture.
"Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored"
"No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture"
Oh no
all furniture
you've got no chance
mm.
"No I mean, what is he, different"
"in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is"
"Oh there yes, no I meant in this country"
Not on par with ours is it?
"I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find."
"Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any"
"A lot, yeah"
from southern Italy at all do you?
Oh you see a lot of them from erm
"Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's"
paediatric coast don't you?
"farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them."
You see them for Rome don't you?
"Not very often, not in here"
Is it tours?
"Not very often, not really"
"Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm"
"mm, what's the other one?"
Catonica
Is it Rimini?
"Rimini, Catonica all on the"
Not guilty.
"Also, that on the twenty first of June you've used the motor vehicle  at Worley on Accrington Road when there was no test certificate in force."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
"Also, that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
"And, finally that you failed to produce a test certificate."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Has he produced these documents to you Miss ?
No sir.
Have you got the insurance with you?
Yes.
The test certificate with you?
Everything my solicitor  was outside.
What?
"I give them to that solicitor that, I were talking to."
Which duty solicitor?
His duty solicitor's
Oh!
Mr .
.
likely to receive custodial sentences.
in this instance.
I can't see any harm  .
Would you like me to show the the prosecuting solicitor?
Well perhaps it'll save time.
.
Mm?
Knowing business effects it.
No  take them off.
One girl nearly got knocked off going up Newtown Road.
It's really quite narrow as you're going up there.
What about the  all the cars all parked round corners everywhere like up at Havers.
Mm.
They could do something about that.
Have you every cycled up there?
"Not round Havers,wh they park where those, those sort of shops are  they they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them."
And of course you meet something coming the other way  wrong side of the road.
Oh yeah.
What annoys me is that everybody parks on the pavement as well.
Mm.
Seem to disobey all laws there are about parking.
"It does, it doesn't really help us does it?"
Do you wanna pass  these around as well if anyone wants to look.
All the replies  got eleven or so replies that I've had for that questionnaire.
There are a few people  willing to help  aren't.
"But I  haven't gone really as I hoped cos I'd envisaged having the membership list with sort of names of who'll make cakes, who'll help on the stall and then know who to phone"
Yeah.
"when I wanted some help or  who to invite to meetings but  because I haven't got a reply from everyone  or most people, it can't work does it?"
Is that all the replies you got?
sent more than fifty out.
I did sixty and Caroline copied even more .
She's a good girl.
Did Georgina reply?
"Erm  did actually, yes."
"Yeah, cos when I phoned she said she's still quite interested."
Mm.
Yeah I thought she was
but she said if the baby .
And  I've got a local group summer questionnaire which I couldn't really fill in.
. Isn't it awful!
I thought I'm just as bad as you know everybody else really.
"Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it."
Mm.
"So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they?"
Mm.
Did this one?
No!
The loop's attached to the end of the strap!
"It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn!"
"So that meant I had to get  the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!"
"So like, you can imagine  I had to have all the strap completely undone  so like  the, the buckle was like down here!"
And above the knot!
Comfortable then?
"Well  it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like  it was really weird because like  you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you  and then like  not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think  why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump  on half the top of her boob, you know !"
It's like a lump there!
"They're thinking, mm, a shame !"
"But like, it was alright then because like  means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time  and so  I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on  like  for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic  love bite around my neck !"
But like er
But I mean
So that was alright really.
"But, I couldn't believe it cos I  he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?"
"And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't"
Yeah.
like them!
Same as me!
"I goes to Scott, I really really  hate love bites   and er  and he goes, yeah and me."
"The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party  Fran , Franny someone, he's  actually a bloke !"
Ooh that's
"I said that's   he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk  and he gave  Scott, Noel and Ian  a love bite  like  for a joke !"
He just decided to do  just for a laugh!
"Oh, how sick!"
Ah what a gay !
"I know like, anyway  but like, Scott had gone home  said to his mum  like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck?"
"Cos some people  er er  may think, you know, the agreement because I have split the load you can still charge me the same price and it may not be the case."
Right.
Next one.
What's the question  ja Andy?
"What is the cus , sorry, what should"
What should
the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
What was some of the answers there?
"Janey's put, name, address, from another consignment note filled out and service requirement"
and weight of the consignment.
Yeah.
So what we were looking for was something more  er erm
Did I answer that one?
No.
I didn't get round to it.
"Anybody get what we were looking for in the, yes you should?"
What should the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
"Well obviously the delivery name and address is important and the consignments, so you didn't get that wrong but there was, what we were looking for  as well a full written declaration of the nature of contents of any consignment containing dangerous  infested, contaminated"
Aha.
or fragile goods.
"In other words, is there anything, did anybody pick up"
You got that.
"Yeah,"
unusual
I did.
"I might have given you one there, that looks good enough."
Oh.
Did you get that there?
I did a part of it.
Oh
I reckon Justin's got enough cos
What
Regional railways have asked for that as well.
Have they?
Yes.
Erm that that
Well Dennis er Roger's been doing for it for Leeds North West haven't you?
He has.
Yeah.
But he's been doing it manually haven't you Rog?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be be because I don't think you can trust the forecast reports from DOPACS.
"I think y yo you could blip from month to month er, er as a priority slipped in or changed, or a person slipped out or, or somebody forgot to zero something or y"
It's too fragile isn't it?
It's far too fragile.
Mm.
"It it's there for us to, to use as a, as a sore thumb exercise to ask questions but, but to actually do anything er, er as critical as saying, we're gonna spend twelve thousand pounds next period and eleven thousand pound the period after and fourteen thousand the period after, er I don't think that's"
computer system's tying your hands behind your back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
"So, so really"
"we're gonna have to have a manual involvement or override there by the project coordinator to, to, to"
"Well if, if you remember we, we agreed with Keith  he would have a think  that and a talk to"
Yeah.
Roy er Roy
You'd remind him about it Hugh.
Yeah.
"But what I'm gonna suggest is that again we go back to the client, and say basically, this is what we think we can provide is that good enough?"
Mm.
This is what you want.
"If we give you that we can give you it in a certain way, but it is not necessarily meaningful."
Mhm.
But I oh I used to go to the country dancing.
So was there a drama club going in  when you came here?
No.
That would be finished up?
"That was finished up, mhm."
"What about the  one, was it still going?"
When you came here?
"I don't think so, I can't remember  eh it going then."
Because I think it was Tommy that said it was really after the  one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here.
"Yes, but er it was actually Mike  that got it back up here,Mike  and Grace , John  's first wife that started it up."
"I can remember Leslie coming home, I think I must have been expecting Doreen at the time, that was in, that was early early on, nineteen, well that was nineteen sixty three, and he was, he had heard that had I had been in the Gatehouse Drama Club, and er he said, Would I be interested in com in coming to the Drama in  if they started?"
Leslie said he would need a special part for me then.
But that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up.
They were very good for it's first
Oh the first concert oh yes
those kind of people.
The f I often find that really the first year it was more fun  and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and
A bit more like hard work really?
"It was really, there wasn't so much fun in it, it was all more serious."
And when Bobby  was there it really was
I remember
Oh yes.
He and Andy  together were very good .
"Mhm, yes, oh they were, aha."
"Bobby was really, he just kept it going really."
Sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people ?
"It , it just needs a character really, just to keep it going."
And he really was a character.
"somehow in the drama, even though it's so long since he passed away ."
There's nobody can replace individual people .
"There no, no, nobody at all."
And do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe a bit more of a strain you know the competitions and
"I don't want any more s in instances where the quantity surveyor thinks he's got a certain fee that he's working to, only to find out later"
Hear hear.
on that somebody's knocked it down by half and not told him.
"Because that causes all sorts of problems on the  report and, and bad blood all round."
Course it did
It's not what team work's
"I mean I, no."
"I would reiterate that my objective is a very simple one, and that is to give the client the most cost-effective service we can."
"Er with this instruction, it will get picked up on the quality"
Co in accordance
er check list.
Good.
Good.
"Could I could I, could I ask that B E S be taken off the distribution codes."
We do not use quantity surveyors for that purpose and indeed the quantity surveyor is not geared up to do any measurement for us.
So you want that
The answer to that is
rewriting then?
No.
Because I think that there should be no reason why the Q S shouldn't provide you with that service in the same way as he provides anybody else Jim.
Unless there's
"But he's, but he's not geared up to do it."
But you've got erm a  Q S then.
We have.
I'm not too sure that means  .
"Well I think, I think  bloody robots"
we all were.
in there like.
electrical  away isn't it?
Mis yeah.
Mister Metal.
That's wound the buggers up.
He wants every single penny accounted for  before he starts doing anything.
But she's that  we
"He had er, fourteen and a half thousand pound once in a building society four year ago  there's nine hundred pound left in his bu er, building society account!"
They want to know where that is.
"She,"
"The solicitor, nobody else, just the solicitor."
Er  he's got some insurance policies  one's for eleven hundred pound  right?
And they're gonna pay that.
And that's gotta go straight direct to the solicitor.
"Also, he's supposed to have had an insurance policies  but General Accident said it's only for a year  and he took it out in seventy seven to nineteen seventy eight."
But he's still got the policy  life insurance on it.
He was insured with the Co-op.
He was insured with the Co-op.
Oh that were a  that'll be  bound to come.
So that's
I don't know.
"Yeah, he won't pay Mrs  insurance money out yet will he?"
"No, he, he, he, he's gotta pay it to the solicitor."
It all gotta go to them?
It's all got to go to solicitor.
And that  fourteen thousand five hundred pound every single penny's got to be accounted for.
Well who's gonna know about that then?
The bank.
Building society he put it in.
The solicitors who gave him the court order  for them to release all the details on that.
And even that car he bought  the
Who?
the solicitor can take it off him
The solicitor wants to know why
And he'd bought a car had he?
Yeah.
For a boy.
"I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute."
"So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than   thereabouts and er that was it."
"But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the   ."
"Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did."
"He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then  he says he didn't carry on, like."
He hadn't been doing  and er  reckon he  and er  think I'm  and that was it  so  right    Been driving since he was  nineteen
"two or three months ago, I think it was."
"I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what  and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since  you know ."
"You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own  fine ."
"So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine?"
He says I am gonna cop it off me mother  cop it of his mother.
You're always going too fast!
I told you before!
"He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad!"
Mm.
slow down.
"Yeah  obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard."
"He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people?"
"Mm, yeah."
Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front.
Mm saw him coming  have to get it  cos Neil's mum was cross about it.
Oh well  he was only just finding out what the rules were.
There was a gang of us chatting with him.
I come up with six points.
That made his day.
He says have I got a fixed penalty?
I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty.
"Know somebody who got one, like."
"No, only a bloke  I've never seen one  had one."
"Yeah, that'd be Richard."
Mm only he's got to  take his licence and insurance in.
As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court  so  it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious.
On their own
singularly
That's a long word isn't it?
Singularly yeah that's not so bad
What's it mean?
"Something to do with singling,si si singing"
We  we can have a game of count down masters
Count down masters
cogitation  don't follow that one up
Mm
"Come on oh the loo, how much further is it?"
I'm getting desperate
Ah desperate's a good word
"Desperado, singular desperate"
Mm
Latin for desperado
"Oh dear   oh it's down about here when, did it the other day, and the woman just drove out straight in front of me from another lane"
Lovely
"I just, I mean, why bother having roundabouts I ask myself"
Well it was a woman come on
Yes it was a woman
"women don't comprehend roundabouts, driving cars"
Oh
"you should know that by now, nothing is ever"
it is an excuse
What?
er don't put your ear piece to the micro to my blooming sweets
I'm not keen on  ear droppings in my sweets
"They're not mine, don't worry"
"Mm, I know"
"I love it, I love it."
So why have you started taking up the bag?
X is going to go up when Y is a million.
X X is a million.
X is a million.
"What, what would Y be?"
A million squared.
Yeah.
"So th the minus one doesn't make a lot of difference, so as X is very, when X gets very big, it'll just look like Y equals X squared,taking one off if"
Mm.
you're working with millions of millions.
"So it looks like Y equals X squared, moved up a bit, more or less, as a good approximation."
"I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be  is more or less big enough."
Mm.
"Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five,over here somewhere,"
Mhm.
behind your shoulder.
"Yeah it'll actually be twenty five minus one,"
Minus one.
but it's a good enough approximation just to see what it'll look like.
So how do you work out the gradient?
"Well you see, it's pretty flattish isn't it?"
"The gradient of a curve is the gradient of tangent, so we can draw a tangent where you wanted it at that place."
It would be the gradient of the tangent.
Mhm.
"If it was at the bottom where it's flat, where you just, you're just coming down, and then you started to go up again, just at the bottom there, it's, it's zero for"
a moment.
"But what would the gradient be there, and how would we find it?"
Er
"It would, it, up here."
"So could you do an approximation, a ver just a very rough guess."
"I mean does it, does it lie over that way or has it sort of gone back on itself?"
Lies over that way?
Yeah.
Oh I seem to remember something like that.
"Erm and the car just broke up in half and that was, that had been  er  welded but like the police are saying as  well as soon as they sort of get wise to what they're doing and they find a way to  er you know, get on to them, they devised something else."
"And the people doing it in these garages erm, you know like respraying and  doing all the welding and everything, really he said some of the things they were doing  if they did it legally they'd make a  good go of it"
Mm.
they were that good at what they were doing.
"Tell me was I dreaming  or did I see a sketch on T V where there's a car driving round, down the road being chased by the police  and the driver said to the passenger er here take this  and he says what's that for and he says it's to steer the car, presses a button  and the car splits"
It's an advert for Malcolm.
the car s the car split in two.
yeah.
A yellow car.
It's an advert for that film called Malcolm
Is that what it was?
about the
Yeah.
retarded lad that invented all these strange  and he did bank robberies with a remote control car.
"It was an advert, it wasn't"
But I did see it on the T V?
Oh you did.
Oh that's fine.
Straight after er  the advert for Del-boy when he says and you know what you can do with that.
Even talking about  trailers now.
Trainers?
Talking about te television trailers.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Not just the programmes.
There was a programme on about trailers the other night as well.
"Have you seen the, the advert for these trainers with no laces, you just tighten the thing up."
Puma Discus system.
They're out on the twenty  of March or something.
Mm.
I wonder how much they're gonna be a pair?
Dunno.
How many people have said that they're going so far?
Well er me and Steve and Mark and you you're going
Yeah.
too aren't you?
So that's four of us definitely going to.
Erm Alison  says she'd like to but her you know it depends on this that and the other.
Yeah.
I I'm definitely going to  I picked this up from the information places.
It's got all a list of all sort of bed and breakfasts and
Oh.
holiday flats and things.
And the holiday flats in here are quite expensive.
But bed and breakfast are all very cheap.
Erm you know.
Where whereabouts is this is it?
I don't know she didn't say.
Didn't that's one thing I don't know .
Cos if it's two or three miles away it's gonna be a bit of a problem.
Yes that's right.
Erm I I need to check that.
How how much erm are the B and Bs?
Well quite cheap.
I mean about ten pound is the cheapest and perhaps even twelve .
The the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get.
Because if if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them.
And if there's four of us there definitely then that's we only each have to cook once while we're there.
Yeah.
to get out of conference  to go to cook.
If it's close.
Yeah.
If fact it's it's I found it in the past to be a welcome very welcome break from the atmosphere because you can't hang around in in the dining hall without talking a Green Party.
As I remember it conference tends to run through until  new clients so.
Yeah.
And also for doing the programme.
Yeah?
"And you want a task schedule for organizing  this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Erm  how is that then?
Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute?
Carry on on that basis?
"Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps  that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale."
Well obviously we've got to progress into that.
We need to prepare some  zone plans and gazetteers maybe.
Yeah.
"Erm  oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er  we could be looking er  towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that."
"There's no real reason why  you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that."
Yeah.
"Erm  y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work."
Okay.
"Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it."
Erm  so you need to build up a picture of what you've got  erm  but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me.
Er in principle.
"Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network  erm  Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run  things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting."
So there'll be two sides of it c er
"Well there, there won't be any  will there?"
Erm
Mm.
But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture.
"What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips."
Which is what happened on Ormskirk.
Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme.
"But there's no reason, and on  as well."
Alright?
That's what I mean.
Just say no and if he  again say no.
when I come out .
"When I , but he won't  I put them all out, in fact ."
.
Ah  oh.
Go on.
No I won't  cos the police were at the car  no  .
Sounds like it were a robbery.
"come out again  police come out of the ca er er they were at the car there  oh I said that's my car, he said oh yeah, I said yeah, he said, what's your name?"
felt like it.
"checked with his radio, he goes alright then  phoned back to the police station on his  radio, he said it's not stolen the owner's now here  he said, can you please get it moved?"
"I said well I'm trying to  I said this bloke what happens to be my oldest brother I said, and he won't even tow it for me!"
"So he said, oh why not?"
"Steven thinks that just be I only just got in he said, I'm having my tea  and he said there's no way I'm gonna do nothing like that at this time of night when I've been fourteen hours at work  So then he stormed off back home again  so he said well you'll have to move it cos it's obstructing the dual carriageway  someone might come round that corner fast and hit it."
"He said it's not an offence he said if you've broke down, you can't help, he said  but you've gotta really move it  so I went round to Paul  and  there was about seven or eight blokes that pushed it all the way round to Bernie's."
No you don't forget Helen  he could come down
I don't forget things like that.
"and ask for any help in doing his car  don't go to work  or can he borrow this, just say  no I'm sorry  you couldn't help us  and I'm your sister  so now I can't"
I know
help you.
He has been like that for  since he's been with her  he has
I know about it.
"He used to help us with anything  before he got with her  he'd always help me  he always looked happy, now he"
Mum mum mum !
"But now he's with her, he don't wanna now."
"Well, you can just do the same with him."
I
You're not that bothered are you?
Well no  but I like to think that Steven's still my brother.
Yeah well I  my son but he don't treat a mother.
But he's not he's not that when he's with her.
that yeah can I answer that
Andrew.
Now you would court martial them well I put it to the S I B
S I B what's that?
That's the Special Investigation Branch .
Special Investigation Branch.
"All the allegations I made, all the beatings I took, I'm bleeding  they investigated nothing, and what the brigadier said, the brigadier is talking nonsense."
He knows that the Army is w widespread in the Army and he .
"It's like everything else you  company commander, you tell him, he throws it out the window."
He sends you away  make you feel happy
"Do you know I've served in the Army for thirty three years and I've commanded every thing at every level in the infantry which both these gentlemen have been in, from a platoon right up now to a brig er brigade and I can honestly tell you that I haven't seen more than a couple of incidents of bullying in the whole of that time ."
You're a commissioned officer
The point is the point is that's that's a good point what you've said you don't see it.
That's the whole point.
You come at a barrack room as an officer
Mm.
"or a corp it doesn't matter,"
Mhm.
You'll see it.
with rank on your arm
Yeah.
the soldiers i that room will act a different way
I I agree.
when the door shuts
I understand that.
a different way again
they will .
"I can understand that , I can understand that."
But it's a matter leadership.
And leadership in the Army is some
Leadership has got nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Leadership
They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night.
Yeah.
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money.
"Er, asking if there's anything we co , look at him walking about with that"
"Everything, everything, what oh, papers have got, has got Legal and General on it."
Mm.
"So, I thought, well"
Yeah.
it can't be a a dodgy
I don't think it'll be anything dodgy.
It won't be dodgy.
Oh.
"But you can always, easily find out"
"What usually happens, though."
"All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring."
"I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like."
"You know, if it's a variable company."
Yeah.
"Things like that, you could do that."
"Different companies take over, I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound."
"We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we?"
Yeah.
"Changed companies three times, that time we had that four thousand pounds."
"You told me about that, yeah."
Well  said that it will be a sm a really small building society.
"He says, that, 'cos er, it's not"
Well.
"Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates, and small building societies are wanting to get going"
"You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house , they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year."
Yeah.
"Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left."
On the money that you owe.
Makes a little noise click click click click.
Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita
Hi.
Lovely Rita meter
Oh don't please.
I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious.
Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me.
Oh they don't.
Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere?
Where am I.
I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe.
Ellenthorpe.
Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning.
"No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone."
So what's this about snow at Thirsk?
Well they can keep it we don't want it.
Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought.
I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out.
Probably.
Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad.
It's not?
No it's not bad
No Okay.
I've just got to get something do you mind?
No go and get your chips or whatever.
No I've got I've got  I wanted t
It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered.
Jolly well ought to as well.
Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home.
Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on.
Have you?
Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back.
If we do this it will be a lot more meaningful.
Is that acceptable?
Yeah.
One point
Fine.
that occurred to me where we could
"perhaps give them some flexibility, is that we could say, if that's not acceptable to you, we will delay invoicing."
"Cos now we don't have to pay interest on our fees,i if, if, if a jam's spread over six months a a a and it might risk and slip to nine months, we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money."
Mm.
Don't like the sound of that.
Er
"the project engineer sits down and manually, let's be honest."
No.
Cos he's gonna just divide it by the number and it's it's
It's it's a very minor part of the operation.
Mm.
I think you've got a little bit careful with lots of our jobs which have got
very very small fees attached to them.
Yeah.
Yes.
which
"It's, it's hardly worth doing."
"at the present time we're saying to  on the monthly report we're saying to the client, we've spent three thousand out of five thousand, and their anticipated final cost is going to be five thousand."
Yeah.
And i he knows when we're actually gonna finish the job and therefore
Mm.
he can almost do that sum himself.
Yes.
I agree.
Er er I think on a bigger job i it it's perhaps a different story.
The trouble is Dennis a lot of our
little jobs.
"But it's certainly er, certainly a valid question."
Yeah.
Woodrow Wilson
"Well, that's what Freud"
also  subject on.
But I know that  such a talented writer.
"You know, I mean, I was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after I'd read the book  I mean, anything I read about, I immediately say, oh yes, of course that's true, you know."
So.
"Well, next week, will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books, won't you?"
Yes.
"In which we shall be looking at, er another famous figure, but, but, er an even more remote and one, some people might say,mytho mythological one, namely Moses."
"So having done Woodrow Wilson this week, we will do Moses, next week."
We'll look forward to that.
"Is anybody Jewish, by the way?"
Right.
"Well, one year, I must admit, somebody in the class stormed out."
"The person started to read their paper on Moses, and I thought she was doing a good job of it, this guy suddenly got up and said, I'm Jewish, I'm not listening to any more of this, and stormed out."
"Oh, I don't see that."
"Erm, what is the most,"
Right.
"Er, that is in,that is in er, Hampstead,."
If you wanna get there
I'm just
"the easiest way to do it, is to take the underground to Finchley Road Station"
Finchley Road Station.
Mhm.
"And when you come out of Finchley Road Station, it's in a place called ."
"I may be able to give you a thing about it actually, if I've still got one."
"You can visit it, it's open  it's best to phone up and find out when they're open, because they're not open every day."
And they  interesting?
"Well, there's  I mean it's interesting, erm, it's Freud's you know, collection of, of classical and antique ."
"They, they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there, but it's not quite true, actually, it was earlier on."
Mm.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah.
Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics  for them to do in Liverpool?
Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you?
No.
"And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get"
Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it?
"you could get  nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether?"
Yeah.
At two on a page is two thousand sheets  plus however many you'd only get one on.
So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't  out of the way really.
And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway.
No.
"Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones."
"If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they?"
Yeah.
"Excuse me, by the time you run a"
Cos we hold the original  to that.
To the interview
Well we'll need some  anyway.
Yeah.
"We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three  so it might be worthwhile  doing a  copy of it."
Doctoring it
Oh I see yeah.
to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for
Oh right.
Yes .
We'll have a look
And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we?
Good.
"I'll, I'll dig it out after."
What was that one?
it was about death penalty wasn't it?
.
"there's all sorts like, like recruiting, making contact with the schools, er, lobbying, er, there, there about ten or twelve different workshops now, almost on almost every aspects, so and that would be something that we could give, if, if these weren't  ."
"But there has to be one guarantee in  because I think once we had rather good one, about six people kept, you can never tell how many  come, I mean you'd want maybe bigger, more than, more space in this room."
"Well, we've, have got another room maybe we might sometimes be able to use haven't we?"
Well we could use the .
"Or your dining room, yes."
it's probably better that
"Mm, we often need to use one more than one room for those."
Mm.
Mm.
Though we do seem to be doing quite well in numbers.
"Yes, we have lately, yes."
Better than last year.
"That suddenly, I mean it means you divide into smaller groups quite often, and, and have discussions on  you can, yeah.."
Speak on what you've got.
"No, might be my speech, do we need a, meet, meet in a more public place, erm."
"No, no, we can't."
.
"But you, erm"
.
"Yes, yes, you, you."
"Erm, your business would take care of itself if we have that pressure of booking it,."
I honestly think it would.
"I think if anything, I'm sure it would."
"Yeah, mm, sure."
I think.
I'm sure that it would  make us more careful the months before.
"Mm, mm."
"Right, going on the streets think it would, going to find that many people that, that could speak to"
That was
Mm mm mm mm.
"he's very  fast  er, deduced  comedy."
There's a lot going on  at a very fast speed.
Which makes
Well I thought it was quite farce like.
Sorry?
I've seen the play and I thought it was quite like a farce.
You know
Yeah.
like
Okay.
But
"this is rather what  what it, makes it difficult is that  I had a copy as well farce  right, but don't say farcical."
That's got different meanings.
"Er, like farce  okay?"
As in this.
Any other things that made it  made it difficult for you to read?
So it's only the language?
"The language, if it had been translated in modern language there'd be no, no problem?"
Were there are any reasons?
"It's supposed to be a play, I suppose you have to watch it."
"When we were reading it I found that I was just reading it as a book and the  and that all the coming about you forget who's in, who's there and who's not there."
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
"More, again, much more by the shape of it, an intensely visual dramatic play, that relies on you being able to see"
spatially  in terms of space  on the  stage.
"People knocking on doors, people hiding behind things, people coming on in costume."
"You know, on the page you can't work out  why erm,is suddenly called  erm  nuns, somebody called the Captain, you know, you, you, you think these are three different characters."
"On the stage you wouldn't make that mistake, you'd be able to keep track of the identity."
"So, another reason  that just adds that  is the element of disguise."
"In Shakespeare  you know, you haven't got that many disguises going on."
Yeah well that don't help with getting your money though does it?
"No  and what's happened is, he's been up the bank  and er  the thing has"
Saved his money.
"and the thingo's gobbled up his card  as he said, well if it hasn't  gobbled your card  then  no problem."
If it has
There's a problem.
"we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week  so  he said well it definitely has."
"Did he say, I'm desperate for my money!"
Yeah  so he said well  what do erm    and he said the woman up there didn't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Why did it gobble his card up then?
Well because A T S  had gone  straight to the bailiff  and the courts  to freeze his account.
Ooh my God!
Mm  because his account was frozen  as soon as he put his card in  it took it in!
Oh!
"So he said, can I get a new card?"
Could you have that done to you then?
No.
You couldn't have that done to you?
"Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done."
Well no cos I ain't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card  but bank said he put the cheque card in  and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he
Alright.
could draw it up to a  a thousand pounds  on that card  I mean
"And you said he's only just paid it, well"
"That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I wouldn't of paid it!"
He says I'd better go and check the money  so he said erm  but what he couldn't understand was  they wrote to him and said that  they haven't paid the cheques  but they didn't say anything about freezing his account!
"Well they should by law, surely!"
Well  dunno.
So he said erm  I said to the woman  I went to the court this morning  so he said   when you explain to me  he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad  tha he said I owed sixty two pound  so he said I said to the woman   in the  court  how can I pay this  the sixty two pounds  when you've frozen my account?
"She said, that's your problem!"
"And we just, he knew a lot of the, he was interested in si singing and he just knew the words and and just sang round about the house."
Mhm.
And he just sang too.
You know that's how he he learnt.
So what were his favourite songs?
"Oh dear, he was  what would you say, I don't know  He liked the kind of  ballads, er he was a more a kind of bay he liked a ballad, so I really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that, just if a song interested him he just"
What do you mean by ballad kind of songs?
"Well more the slow, er songs, not the fast."
The love songs and things like that ?
Things like that.
Mhm.
"but I I never sang anywhere, I just sang round the house as well."
Mhm.
And it was really er I think it was really the pantomimes that I started singing
Was it?
"here, oh yes."
I never I never went out
Were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then as well?
"I was in the  Drama Club when I was when I stayed at home, but we didn't do pantomimes, we we did plays, one act plays, and three act plays, we did three act plays."
We never did pantomimes.
"And er  but that's the only time, you sang at weddings."
"So I said, Come on Mabel, sing."
Or my father would sing
So how long did you live in  for?
"We've , into the village, we lived out in the countryside till I was eight, and we come down into the I should say town shouldn't I, we come down into the town when I was eight and I was there till I was twenty two, and I came up here, when I got married."
"Mhm, is Leslie from this part of the country?"
"Les is from  oh well he was, I think he was three when he came up here."
"He lived in, he was born in Castle Douglas."
Mhm.
But I think he was three when his father was sh came up here to work.
What did his father do when he came here?
"Electrician, you know he still worked for the the electricity board ."
Mhm.
the ins and outs.
Mhm.
But that happens all over.
"Mhm, what's the pay like compared to other factories in the area?"
It's quite low.
Is it?
Mhm.
Because er  how many years ago is it?
"Seven or eight years ago we, we, we're on piecework, we made our own wage."
"Er and most of us had in excess of a hundred pound, maybe a hundred and six, a hundred and ten pound, but when this guy bought place over, there was a kind of flat rate, and we'd to drop sixteen pounds to ninety"
Mm.
pounds.
"Well at the time you're thinking, God that's better than twenty or twenty five pound if you were unemployed,"
That's right.
"on the brew, kind of thing."
Mhm.
"So you jumped at the chance, but it is, I think th th poverty wage in Europe is it not, not about a hundred and forty, a hundred and forty five pounds?"
"Well we're nowhere near that, nowhere near that."
"Mm, that's right, mm."
That's why when I hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty K a year I'm going  it would pay me two or three years  for God's sake.
You can look after me then.
But saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime.
Yes.
And most people do.
Mm.
Because er i from the management point of view if you have got four hundred people and you work a lot of overtime that saves you having six or seven hundred people.
Mhm.
And if you want to cut back you can either cut down on your workforce or you can cut down in the
Mhm.
overtime.
"In my department just now they're working seven days a week,"
"That is  their own fault  because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying  they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it"
Mm.
they must be selling it
Well they will do.
"them very cheap  because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling"
No thanks.
and it said  about tin cans and aluminium and that  and it was costing them less  excuse me  to use recycled  you know er  used aluminium
Mm.
and used steel cans and that  it was costing them  less to use that  than it was to use
Brand new stuff.
yeah.
Yeah.
"So, I mean  to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but  that my first thought is that they must be buying it very"
It's gotta be profitable
they must be buying it very cheap then?
Mm.
Mm.
"So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it  are selling it to them very cheap  so it is their own fault!"
I think initially er
It's only it's been cheaper to
now has got a cost more  in the initial
Well it does
"stages  until it's sort of, set up, until  everyone is sort of you know  geared into doing this  kind of  you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the  goes there"
"Well yes, because they're not"
"and all the companies that are responsible for  for re-using it  and all the  distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there  you know, once that network is going then surely"
Oh yes!
it's gotta be  useful because  instead of going  you know  from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being  ever seen again  it's going
That's right!
"in a circle and, and  surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up?"
"And it's a, it's an ongoing thing"
Yeah!
"You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean  it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have  three bins."
Mm.
"This government says ooh we can't afford that, no, it's a  it's a gimmick!"
The Yank says we will!
Bingo!
"And look, this used to be"
We could of held them to ransom!
one of the best education systems in the world!
And I mean
"I know, it isn't now!"
won't be here now  well you could  sliding right
I know!
down the scale!
Mm.
We're terrible!
We're way behind
"Germany, France"
you can only cut back
Russia
and prune back so much in the name of efficiency before  sooner
Well
or later things su suffer!
"There was, there was a programme on Channel Four there to I was watching  before I picked my book up  and  they had Conservative  Labour bloke and the independent er  Liberals  and these were supposedly  they have on on er Channel Four a a programme called Week in Politics  anyway  this night, this, tonight they were doing a  a fu , they had a floating audience, supposedly a floating audience"
"You mean, they were under water?"
"flo ,fa floating vo er voters"
Oh!
"er  until, until the end  and they had a poll of er  who  who has been persuaded to vote  for  the three la , you know, what had they done to"
Oh they had to  to say who they supported and
"vote for the three, that's right  and there was one  one put their hand up for  he persuaded them that Ne , Neil Kinnock would be a good leader, that was it  er  so one put their hand up for him  one put their hand up for Major  and she had the cheek to say"
that that is only because I'm a Conservative!
"And it was supposed to be , if the audience was supposed to be voting"
and I mean  but the  quite  the majority of them  er  put their hands up for  Paddy Ashdown.
Yeah  he's a very persuasive   character
Picture puzzle.
Can you work out today's picture puzzle?
This horse is running somewhere  today.
Okay
I wonder where?
I promise three extra ice creams

Something to do Miss er Sara Lingfield I wonder where that's running today?
O eight nine one double nine double one double four   win a hundred pound do you win a copy of this book?

Peter Niven rode a five timer at Ayr in nineteen ninety two.
Eighteen eighty nine the Foston selling plate at Derby was declared void after the whole field got lost in the thick fog covering the course and ended up running round the back of a cricket pavilion.
Have you been round the back of a cricket pavilion recently?
No.
But there was a  one day in which Frenchie Nick Nicholson erm brought all the tail-enders across and  had been told the one thing he shouldn't do was be last he was thinking I'm not last and  behind you then he came in in front of him and he was last.
I love it.
Lovely story.
Anyway that's it from the morning line.
I'm off to Windsor they're off to  Cheltenham and everywhere else.
We'll see you next Saturday.
We'll give you the result of picture puzzle then.
Till then from all of us  bye bye.
See you next week.
Good afternoon and welcome to On the Record.
"We know what the Conservative party thought of Michael Heseltine this week, they cheered him to the echo when he strode on to the platform at Blackpool."
But what does Michael Heseltine think of the party?
And of the direction it has now taken.
"In today's programme he gives us an exclusive interview, the first since his heart attack four months ago."
There's that other roundabout isn't there?
You know where the horses were in the field?
That was a four armed roundabout.
Just down from
Yeah.
the station house place where we parked
You'll find that erm  the flows there are very low.
So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people
I reckon
doing that?
I reckon
"Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right."
Treat it as a crossroads  perhaps.
"I reckon  si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem."
I think you'll find the flow is a  a low
it wasn't busy when we were there was it?
"No I mean it may be, you know you  i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four  not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought."
No.
Okay I'll take four people
And erm we're going very round very slow.
And the visibility was good and everything.
"So I'd have thought that erm  you could put four or six, four or six people on that."
And actually if we just counted this  to through traffic wouldn't be too much
Hello  right.
your pudding?
What erm  have you heard any of it?you have.
What did it sound like?
It's good.
We both just said that it ne you'd never think that you sound right on  tape.
I always think I sound high pitched.
sounds all like bloody  what she does say.
Yeah
don't we?
Well we wanna know whether we were gonna try and do them all in that week?
Twenty seventh of April.
Monday Tuesday Thursday.
I think the plan that goes to  to the police  thank you  needs to show the i interview sites on it.
"You remember we had, on the Ormskirk one we did one that had a study area on it?"
Yeah.
But we also had one  that showed the individual locations.
Yeah.
And I think that was the one that went to the police.
Right.
"Er and the fire brigade and, and so on."
Yeah cos they'll want to know.
Well that's it.
Yeah.
"And all you're doing is warning them that they will, the things will be there and we'll make sure that if a  emergency vehicle comes along  erm"
But they will know your precise dates won't they?
Well they'll want to know precise dates.
I can't remember that we did actually.
"No I don't know whether we do give them, even  the precise dates."
"It isn't really much use then is it, just giving them  a rough ?"
Well it's only a warning.
"Well we'll have a look back in, I'll have a look back in the file and see what we did last time."
"Erm  Do you wanna do that, have a look at what we'd said in Ormskirk"
Yeah.
on that side of things?
Yeah.
I think I wrote to them if I remember rightly.
Well I didn't.
Erm  now we need to do something about layout plans.
So we need to get some  if we're going to work on ordnance survey ones we'll need to sort something on that.
Have to have a chat with   Anyway you're not in an immediate rush to do that are you?
We've gotta devise a new land reform law.
What's our priority?
"What, what, what really is the land reform  to achieve now?"
of feudalism
You've gotta
Right.
Yeah.
Protect commerce and industry.
protect commerce and industry.
"Yeah, I guess it's all"
Just looked after  go on.
Erm  well  erm it's that
Yeah.
we are now in power  but I don't think  that presumably proved that we can run an economy efficiently
Mm.
and
once we've got that then we have the resources from that I think to introduce other programmes that take
Mm.
"quite a long time to implement, for example"
Mhm.
erm
"Wh when you're saying to run the economy, do you mean the rural economy or the economy, you know, China as a whole?"
Well let's say we've moved on to and we're into nineteen forty nine say
Yeah.
and we've  in nineteen forty nine
"and  w w w we are either half controlled or we're, we can now see that you know the civil war is, is going so quickly our way that we are going to have control  within a year or so we are likely to have control over the economy as a whole."
D does that begin to make a difference?
Yes because now
Right.
Yes.
So we then have to coordinate our policies
Mm.
"Tom , give me one end of a cord here ; I will so truss me this sea-thief , hand and foot together , like a basting turkey -- marry , I will so bind him up -- and thereafter I will so beat -- so beat him ! ''"
"And so he ran on , winding the cord meanwhile about Dick 's limbs with the dexterity peculiar to seamen , and at every turn and cross securing it with a knot , and tightening the whole fabric with a savage pull ."
"When he had done , the lad was a mere package in his hands -- as helpless as the dead ."
"The skipper held him at arm 's length , and laughed aloud ."
"Then he fetched him a stunning buffet on the ear ; and then turned him about , and furiously kicked and kicked him ."
"Anger rose up in Dick 's bosom like a storm ; anger strangled him , and he thought to have died ; but when the sailor , tired of this cruel play , dropped him all his length upon the sand and turned to consult with his companions , he instantly regained command of his temper ."
"Here was a momentary respite ; ere they began again to torture him , he might have found some method to escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure ."
"Presently , sure enough , and while his captors were still discussing what to do with him , he took heart of grace , and , with a pretty steady voice , addressed them ."
"`` My masters , '' he began , `` are ye gone clean foolish ?"
"Here hath Heaven put into your hands as pretty an occasion to grow rich as ever shipman had -- such as ye might make thirty over-sea adventures and not find again -- and , by the mass I what do ye ?"
Beat me ?
-- nay ; so would an angry child !
"But for long-headed tarry-Johns , that fear not fire nor water , and that love gold as they love beef , methinks ye are not wise . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Tom , `` now y ' are trussed ye would cozen us . ''"
`` Cozen you ! ''
repeated Dick .
"`` Nay , if ye be fools , it would be easy ."
"But if ye be shrewd fellows , as I trow ye are , ye can see plainly where your interest lies ."
"When I took your ship from you , we were many , we were well clad and armed ; but now , bethink you a little , who mustered that array ?"
One incontestably that hath much gold .
"And if he , being already rich , continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storms -- bethink you once more -- shall there not be a treasure somewhere hidden ? ''"
`` What meaneth he ? ''
asked one of the men .
"`` Why , if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of vinegary wine , '' continued Dick , `` forget them , for the trash they are ; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the name , that shall , in twelve hours , make or mar you for ever ."
"But take me up from where I lie , and let us go somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon , for I am sore and frozen , and my mouth is half among the snow . ''"
"`` He seeks but to cozen us , '' said Tom , contemptuously ."
`` Cozen !
cozen ! ''
cried the third man .
`` I would I could see the man that could cozen me !
He were a cozener indeed !
"Nay , I was not born yesterday ."
"`` We 'll try , '' promised Cyrilla with dancing eyes ."
When the door closed behind Mrs. Plunkett the three girls looked at each other .
"`` Cyrilla , that idea of yours was a really truly inspiration , '' said Carol solemnly ."
"`` I believe it was , '' said Cyrilla , thinking of Miss Marshall ."
Dorinda 's Desperate Deed Dorinda had been home for a whole wonderful week and the little Pages were beginning to feel acquainted with her .
"When a girl goes away when she is ten and does n't come back until she is fifteen , it is only to be expected that her family should regard her as somewhat of a stranger , especially when she is really a Page , and they are really all Carters except for the name ."
"Dorinda had been only ten when her Aunt Mary -- on the Carter side -- had written to Mrs. Page , asking her to let Dorinda come to her for the winter ."
"Mrs. Page , albeit she was poor -- nobody but herself knew how poor -- and a widow with five children besides Dorinda , hesitated at first ."
"She was afraid , with good reason , that the winter might stretch into other seasons ; but Mary had lost her own only little girl in the summer , and Mrs. Page shuddered at the thought of what her loneliness must be ."
"So , to comfort her , Mrs. Page had let Dorinda go , stipulating that she must come home in the spring ."
"In the spring , when Dorinda 's bed of violets was growing purple under the lilac bush , Aunt Mary wrote again ."
"Dorinda was contented and happy , she said ."
Would not Emily let her stay for the summer ?
Mrs. Page cried bitterly over that letter and took sad counsel with herself .
"To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for the summer really meant , she knew , to let her stay altogether ."
Mrs. Page was finding it harder and harder to get along ; there was so little and the children needed so much ; Dorinda would have a good home with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother heart to give her up .
In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for the summer -- and Dorinda had never been home since .
"But now Dorinda had come back to the little white house on the hill at Willowdale , set back from the road in a smother of apple trees and vines ."
"Aunt Mary had died very suddenly and her only son , Dorinda 's cousin , had gone to Japan ."
"There was nothing for Dorinda to do save to come home , to enter again into her old unfilled place in her mother 's heart , and win a new place in the hearts of the brothers and sisters who barely remembered her at all ."
Leicester had been nine and Jean seven when Dorinda went away ; now they were respectively fourteen and twelve .
"At first they were a little shy with this big , practically brand-new sister , but this soon wore off ."
Nobody could be shy long with Dorinda ; nobody could help liking her .
"She was so brisk and jolly and sympathetic -- a real Page , so everybody said -- while the brothers and sisters were Carter to their marrow ; Carters with fair hair and blue eyes , and small , fine , wistful features ; but Dorinda had merry black eyes , plump , dusky-red cheeks , and a long braid of glossy dark hair , which was perpetually being twitched from one shoulder to another as Dorinda whisked about the house on domestic duties intent ."
"In a week Dorinda felt herself one of the family again , with all the cares and responsibilities thereof resting on her strong young shoulders ."
"Dorinda and her mother talked matters out fully one afternoon over their sewing , in the sunny south room where the winds got lost among the vines halfway through the open window ."
Mrs. Page sighed and said she really did not know what to do .
"Dorinda did not sigh ; she did not know just what to do either , but there must be something that could be done -- there is always something that can be done , if one can only find it ."
Dorinda sewed hard and pursed up her red lips determinedly .
"`` Do n't you worry , Mother Page , '' she said briskly ."
`` We 'll be like that glorious old Roman who found a way or made it .
I like overcoming difficulties .
"That day the cows wandered father than ever they had done before , and never stopped till they had reached a moor where the heather was burning ."
"The fire was fierce , but the cows took no heed , and walked steadily through it , Covan the Brown-haired following them ."
"Next they plunged into a foaming river , and Covan plunged in after them , though the water came high above his waist ."
"On the other side of the river lay a wide plain , and here the cows lay down , while Covan looked about him ."
"Near him was a house built of yellow stone , and from it came sweet songs , and Covan listened , and his heart grew light within him ."
"While he was thus waiting there ran up to him a youth , scarcely able to speak so swiftly had he sped ; and he cried aloud : ` Hasten , hasten , Covan the Brown-haired , for your cows are in the corn , and you must drive them out ! '"
"` Nay , ' said Covan smiling , ` it had been easier for you to have driven them out than to come here to tell me . '"
And he went on listening to the music .
"Very soon the same youth returned and cried with panting breath : ` Out upon you , Covan son of Gorla , that you stand there agape ."
"For our dogs are chasing your cows , and you must drive them off ! '"
"` Nay , then , ' answered Covan as before , ` it had been easier for you to call off your dogs than to come here to tell me . '"
And he stayed where he was till the music ceased .
"Then he turned to look for the cows , and found them all lying in the place where he had left them ; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards , taking a different path to that they had trod in the morning ."
"This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed , yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there , both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass ."
"Further on they crossed another plain , where the grass was thick and green , but on it were feeding a foal and its mother , so lean that you could have counted their ribs ."
"And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats ; one full of gay and happy youths , journeying to the land of the Sun , and another with grim shapes clothed in black , travelling to the land of Night ."
` What can these things mean ? '
"said Covan to himself , as he followed his cows ."
"Darkness now fell , the wind howled , and torrents of rain poured upon them ."
"Covan knew not how far they might yet have to go , or indeed if they were on the right road ."
"He could not even see his cows , and his heart sank lest , after all , he should have failed to bring them safely back ."
What was he to do ?
"He waited thus , for he could go neither forwards nor backwards , till he felt a great friendly paw laid on his shoulder ."
"` My cave is just here , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor , of whom Covan son of Gorla had heard much ."
"` Spend the night here , and you shall be fed on the flesh of lamb , and shall lay aside three-thirds of thy weariness . '"
"And Covan entered , and supped , and slept , and in the morning rose up a new man ."
"` Farewell , Covan , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"` May success go with you , for you took what I had to give and did not mock me ."
"So , when danger is your companion , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"At these words the Dog of Maol-mor disappeared into the forest , and Covan went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them ."
"At the sight of Covan the Brown-haired they walked onwards , Covan following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left ."
"All that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain , with only rocks for shelter ."
"In ten minutes , Mr. Bhaer and Silas were off to the wood , and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great pasture ."
"Mrs. Jo caught up some food from the table , a little bottle of brandy from the medicine-closet , took a lantern , and bidding Jack and Emil come with her , and the rest not stir , she trotted away on Toby , never stopping for hat or shawl ."
"She heard some one running after her , but said not a word till , as she paused to call and listen , the light of her lantern shone on Dan 's face ."
`` You here !
"I told Jack to come , '' she said , half-inclined to send him back , much as she needed help ."
"`` I would n't let him ; he and Emil had n't had any supper , and I wanted to come more than they did , '' he said , taking the lantern from her and smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her feel as if , boy though he was , she had some one to depend on ."
"Off she jumped , and ordered him on to Toby , in spite of his pleading to walk ; then they went on again along the dusty , solitary road , stopping every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to reply ."
"When they came to the great pasture , other lights were already flitting to and fro like will-o ' - the-wisps , and Mr. Bhaer 's voice was heard shouting , `` Nan !"
Rob !
Rob !
Nan ! ''
in every part of the field .
"Silas whistled and roared , Dan plunged here and there on Toby , who seemed to understand the case , and went over the roughest places with unusual docility ."
"Often Mrs. Jo hushed them all , saying , with a sob in her throat , `` The noise may frighten them , let me call ; Robby will know my voice ; '' and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone of tenderness , till the very echoes whispered it softly , and the winds seemed to waft it willingly ; but still no answer came ."
"The sky was overcast now , and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen , heat-lightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then , and a faint far-off rumble as of thunder told that a summer-storm was brewing ."
`` O my Robby !
my Robby ! ''
"mourned poor Mrs. Jo , wandering up and down like a pale ghost , while Dan kept beside her like a faithful fire-fly ."
`` What shall I say to Nan 's father if she comes to harm ?
Why did I ever trust my darling so far away ?
"Fritz , do you hear any thing ? ''"
"and when a mournful , `` No '' came back , she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan sprung down from Toby 's back , tied the bridle to the bars , and said , in his decided way , `` They may have gone down the spring I 'm going to look . ''"
"He was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him ; but when she reached the spot , he lowered the lantern and showed her with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring ."
"She fell down on her knees to examine the tracks , and then sprung up , saying eagerly , `` Yes ; that is the mark of my Robby 's little boots !"
"Come this way , they must have gone on . ''"
Such a weary search !
"But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead the anxious mother , for presently Dan uttered a cry , and caught up a little shining object lying in the path ."
"It was the cover of the new tin pail , dropped in the first alarm of being lost ."
"Mrs. Jo hugged and kissed it as if it were a living thing ; and when Dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot , she stopped him , saying , as she hurried on , `` No , let me find them ; I let Rob go , and I want to give him back to his father all myself . ''"
"A little farther on Nan 's hat appeared , and after passing the place more than once , they came at last upon the babes in the wood , both sound asleep ."
Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his lantern shone that night .
"He thought Mrs. Jo would cry out , but she only whispered , `` Hush ! ''"
"Many times a shining stone at the bottom of the stream was taken for the slipper itself , and every evening saw a band of dripping downcast men returning homewards ."
"But one youth always lingered longer than the rest , and night would still see him engaged in the search , though his clothes stuck to his skin and his teeth chattered ."
"One day , when the king was lying on his bed racked with pain , he heard the noise of a scuffle going on in his antechamber , and rang a golden bell that stood by his side to summon one of his servants ."
"` Sire , ' answered the attendant , when the king inquired what was the matter , ` the noise you heard was caused by a young man from the town , who has had the impudence to come here to ask if he may measure your majesty 's foot , so as to make you another slipper in place of the lost one . '"
` And what have you done to the youth ? '
said the king .
"` The servants pushed him out of the palace , and , added a few blows to teach him not to be insolent , ' replied the man ."
"` Then they did very ill , ' answered the king , with a frown ."
"` He came here from kindness , and there was no reason to maltreat him . '"
"` Oh , my lord , he had the audacity to wish to touch your majesty 's sacred person -- he , a good-for-nothing boy , a mere shoemaker 's apprentice , perhaps !"
And even if he could make shoes to perfection they would be no use without the soothing balsam . '
"The king remained silent for a few moments , then he said : ` Never mind ."
Go and fetch the youth and bring him to me .
I would gladly try any remedy that may relieve my pain . '
"So , soon afterwards , the youth , who had not gone far from the palace , was caught and ushered into the king 's presence ."
"He was tall and handsome and , though he professed to make shoes , his manners were good and modest , and he bowed low as he begged the king not only to allow him to take the measure of his foot , but also to suffer him to place a healing plaster over the wound ."
"Balancin was pleased with the young man 's voice and appearance , and thought that he looked as if he knew what he was doing ."
"So he stretched out his bad foot which the youth examined with great attention , and then gently laid on the plaster ."
"Very shortly the ointment began to soothe the sharp pain , and the king , whose confidence increased every moment , begged the young man to tell him his name . '"
"I have no parents ; they died when I was six , sire , ' replied the youth , modestly ."
"` Everyone in the town calls me Gilguerillo , because , when I was little , I went singing through the world in spite of my misfortunes ."
Luckily for me I was born to be happy . '
` And you really think you can cure me ? '
asked the king .
"` Completely , my lord , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
` And how long do you think it will take ? '
"` It is not an easy task ; but I will try to finish it in a fortnight , ' replied the youth ."
A fortnight seemed to the king a long time to make one slipper .
But he only said : ` Do you need anything to help you ? '
"` Only a good horse , if your majesty will be kind enough to give me one , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
"And the reply was so unexpected that the courtiers could hardly restrain their smiles , while the king stared silently ."
"` You shall have the horse , ' he said at last , ` and I shall expect you back in a fortnight ."
"When that is done , come to us and we will give you further directions . ' '"
"I will obey you in everything , dear brothers , ' answered Lyman ; and so she did ."
"It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture , and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day 's dinner ."
"The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing , and where the beasts were secured ; so , at midnight , when all was still , they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together ."
"The animals were frightened , and began to neigh and kick , as if they were fighting together , and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it , and that was a thing which had never occurred before ."
"Raising himself in his bed , he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves ."
"The young Stalo did as he was bid , and left the house ; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos , and fell without a groan ."
"Then they went back to worry the reindeer , and the noise became as great as ever , and a second time the Stalo awoke ."
"` The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts , ' he cried to his second brother ; ` go and help him , or I shall never get to sleep . '"
"So the brother went , and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno ."
"The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet , but as the clatter of the reindeer 's horns was as bad as ever , he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself : ` It is extraordinary that they can not unlock themselves ; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it . '"
"Rubbing his eyes , he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls ."
"The Sodnos heard it below , and posted themselves , one at the big door and one at the little door at the back , for they did not know what their enemy would come out at ."
"The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed , where it always lay , but the mantle was no there ."
"He wondered where it could be , and who could have moved it , and after searching through all the rooms , he found it hanging over the kitchen fire ."
"But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone , and went with nothing , except a stick in his hand , through the back door ."
"The young Sodno was standing ready for him , and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again ."
"The two Sodnos did not trouble about him , but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes , in which they dressed themselves ."
Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos ' mother where the treasure was hidden .
With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman 's room .
"She was already up and dressed , and sitting by the window knitting , and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor , laying his head on her lap ."
"For a while he kept silence , then he whispered gently : ` Tell me , dear mother , where did my eldest brother conceal his riches ? '"
` What a strange question !
"Surely you must know , ' answered she ."
"` No , I have forgotten ; my memory is so bad . '"
"` He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there , ' said she ."
And there was another pause .
By-and-by the Sodno asked again : ` And where may my second brother 's money be ? '
` Do n't you know that either ? '
cried the mother in surprise .
"` Oh , yes ; I did once ."
But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing . '
Peter flung out his arms .
"There were no children there , and it was night time ; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland , and who were therefore nearer to him than you think : boys and girls in their nighties , and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees ."
`` Do you believe ? ''
he cried .
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate .
"She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative , and then again she was n't sure ."
`` What do you think ? ''
she asked Peter .
"`` If you believe , '' he shouted to them , `` clap your hands ; do n't let Tink die . ''"
Many clapped .
Some did n't .
A few beasts hissed .
The clapping stopped suddenly ; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening ; but already Tink was saved .
"First her voice grew strong , then she popped out of bed , then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever ."
"She never thought of thanking those who believed , but she would have like to get at the ones who had hissed ."
`` And now to rescue Wendy ! ''
"The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree , begirt -LSB- belted -RSB- with weapons and wearing little else , to set out upon his perilous quest ."
It was not such a night as he would have chosen .
"He had hoped to fly , keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes ; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees , thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir ."
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach .
"There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion , at which happily he was an adept -LSB- expert -RSB- ."
"But in what direction , for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship ?"
"A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks ; and a deathly silence pervaded the island , as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage ."
"He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell , and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it ."
"Slightly , if he had an opportunity , would blaze -LSB- cut a mark in -RSB- the trees , for instance , Curly would drop seeds , and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place ."
"The morning was needed to search for such guidance , and he could not wait ."
"The upper world had called him , but would give no help ."
"The crocodile passed him , but not another living thing , not a sound , not a movement ; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree , or stalking him from behind ."
He swore this terrible oath : `` Hook or me this time . ''
"Now he crawled forward like a snake , and again erect , he darted across a space on which the moonlight played , one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready ."
He was frightfully happy .
"Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP One green light squinting over Kidd 's Creek , which is near the mouth of the pirate river , marked where the brig , the JOLLY ROGER , lay , low in the water ; a rakish-looking -LSB- speedy-looking -RSB- craft foul to the hull , every beam in her detestable , like ground strewn with mangled feathers ."
"Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candy-ball during the game , which evidently sweetened her temper , for the last thing she said on going to bed was , `` When my battledore and shuttle-cock comes , I 'll let you all play with 'em . ''"
Her first remark in the morning was `` Has my box come ? ''
"and when told that it would arrive sometime during the day , she fretted and fumed , and whipped her doll , till Daisy was shocked ."
"She managed to exist , however , till five o'clock , when she disappeared , and was not missed till supper-time , because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with Tommy and Demi ."
"`` I saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt , '' said Mary Ann , coming in with the hasty-pudding , and finding every one asking , `` Where is Nan ? ''"
"`` She has run home , little gypsy ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Bhaer , looking anxious ."
"`` Perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage , '' suggested Franz ."
"`` That is impossible , she does not know the way , and if she found it , she could never carry the box a mile , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , beginning to think that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out ."
"`` It would be like her , '' and Mr. Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find the child , when a shout from Jack , who was at the window , made everyone hurry to the door ."
"There was Miss Nan , to be sure , tugging along a very large band-box tied up in linen bag ."
"Very hot and dusty and tired did she look , but marched stoutly along , and came puffing up to the steps , where she dropped her load with a sigh of relief , and sat down upon it , observed as she crossed her tired arms , `` I could n't wait any longer , so I went and got it . ''"
"`` But you did not know the way , '' said Tommy , while the rest stood round enjoying the joke ."
"`` Oh , I found it , I never get lost . ''"
"`` It 's a mile , how could you go so far ? ''"
"`` Well , it was pretty far , but I rested a good deal . ''"
`` Was n't that thing very heavy ? ''
"`` It 's so round , I could n't get hold of it good , and I thought my arms would break right off . ''"
"`` I do n't see how the station-master let you have it , '' said Tommy ."
`` I did n't say anything to him .
"He was in the little ticket place , and did n't see me , so I just took it off the platform . ''"
"`` Run down and tell him it is all right , Franz , or old Dodd will think it is stolen , '' said Mr. Bhaer , joining in the shout of laughter at Nan 's coolness ."
`` I told you we would send for it if it did not come .
"Another time you must wait , for you will get into trouble if you run away ."
"Promise me this , or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , wiping the dust off Nan 's little hot face ."
"`` Well , I wo n't , only papa tells me not to put off doing things , so I do n't . ''"
"`` That is rather a poser ; I think you had better give her some supper now , and a private lecture by and by , '' said Mr. Bhaer , too much amused to be angry at the young lady 's exploit ."
"The boys thought it `` great fun , '' and Nan entertained them all supper-time with an account of her adventures ; for a big dog had barked at her , a man had laughed at her , a woman had given her a doughnut , and her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink , exhausted with her exertion ."
"`` I fancy you will have your hands full now , my dear ; Tommy and Nan are quite enough for one woman , '' said Mr. Bhaer , half an hour later ."
"`` I know it will take some time to tame the child , but she is such a generous , warm-hearted little thing , I should love her even if she were twice as naughty , '' answered Mrs. Jo , pointing to the merry group , in the middle of which stood Nan , giving away her things right and left , as lavishly as if the big band-box had no bottom ."
"It was those good traits that soon made little `` Giddygaddy , '' as they called her , a favorite with every one ."
"Daisy never complained of being dull again , for Nan invented the most delightful plays , and her pranks rivalled Tommy 's , to the amusement of the whole school ."
asked Jose .
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call the little fish whose life you saved , and she will bring it to you . '"
"So he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones , and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring , and brought it to Jose in its mouth ."
"Well pleased with all he had done , Jose returned to the palace ; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor , she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil . '"
"I am very sorry , ' said the king to Jose , ' I really would rather not ; but you see I have no choice . '"
"While the oil was being heated in the great caldron , Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape ."
"` Do not be frightened , ' said the horse ."
"` Get on my back , and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . '"
"Jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil ."
He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough .
"Then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and Bella-Flor most of all ."
"As for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of Jose ."
"Then Jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day ."
"But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ` It is to you that I owe my life and my crown ."
Why have you done all this for me ? '
And the horse answered : ' I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune .
"And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you , as you had helped me ."
"For , as I told you , Good deeds bear their own fruit ! '"
"The Bird of Truth -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones , y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which , shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns , flowed quietly past trees and under bushes , listening to the songs of the birds overhead ."
"One day , when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets , he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal ."
Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet .
"Inside , lying on a soft bed of cotton , were two babies , a boy and a girl , who opened their eyes and smiled at him ."
"The man was filled with pity at the sight , and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife ."
The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle .
"` Are not eight children enough , ' she cried , ` without bringing us two more ?"
How do you think we can feed them ? '
"` You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger , ' answered he , ` or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea ?"
What is enough for eight is also enough for ten . '
The wife said no more ; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures .
"Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut , and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that , in time , their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own , who were quarrelsome and envious ."
"It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them , and were always playing tricks on them , so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river ."
"He was on the point of turning homeward , with an unreasoning sense of disappointment , when one of Lynde 's dogs broke down through the hedge of spruces , barking loudly ."
"Alan looked for Lynde to follow , but she did not , and he speedily saw that there was something unusual about the dog 's behaviour ."
"The animal circled around him , still barking excitedly , then ran off for a short distance , stopped , barked again , and returned , repeating the manoeuvre ."
"It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him , and it occurred to the young minister that the dog 's mistress must be in danger of some kind ."
"Instantly he set off after him ; and the dog , with a final sharp bark of satisfaction , sprang up the low bank into the spruces ."
"Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further shore , which rapidly grew steep and high ."
"Half a mile down the cliffs were rocky and precipitous , while the beach beneath them was heaped with huge boulders ."
Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four Winds .
"Then the animal halted , ran to the edge of the cliff and barked ."
"It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently broken away recently , and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and looked down ."
He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm .
"A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of rock , below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel boulders below ."
"The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a glance ; the soil on which she lay was stationary , yet it seemed as if the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink ."
"Lynde lay movelessly ; her face was white , and both fear and appeal were visible in her large dilated eyes ."
Yet she was quite calm and a faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog .
"`` Good faithful Pat , so you did bring help , '' she said ."
"`` But how can I help you , Miss Oliver ? ''"
said Alan hoarsely .
`` I can not reach you -- and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send that broken earth over the brink . ''
`` I fear it would .
You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope . ''
`` And leave you here alone -- in such danger ? ''
`` Pat will stay with me .
"Besides , there is nothing else to do ."
You will find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily .
Father and Emily are away .
I think I am quite safe here if I do n't move at all . ''
"Alan 's own common sense told him that , as she said , there was nothing else to do and , much as he hated to leave her alone thus , he realized that he must lose no time in doing it ."
"`` I 'll be back as quickly as possible , '' he said hurriedly ."
Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not forgotten their old training .
"Yet it seemed to him an age ere he reached Four Winds , secured the rope , and returned ."
At every flying step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could rescue her .
But I am still waiting your opinion . ''
I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour .
"He looked me all over with a warlike eye , and I saw the challenge at his lips ."
"But either my youth disarmed him , or perhaps his own sense of justice ."
"Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned , and not least Cluny ; the more credit that he took it as he did ."
"`` Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` I think you are too nice and covenanting , but for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman ."
"Upon my honest word , ye may take this money -- it 's what I would tell my son -- and here 's my hand along with it ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXIV THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE QUARREL Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night , and went down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch , whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage ."
"This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan 's great-coat in the bargain , trotting along under the burthen , far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground , like a stout hill pony with a feather ; yet he was a man that , in plain contest , I could have broken on my knee ."
"Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered ; and perhaps without that relief , and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness , I could not have walked at all ."
"I was but new risen from a bed of sickness ; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion ; travelling , as we did , over the most dismal deserts in Scotland , under a cloudy heaven , and with divided hearts among the travellers ."
"For long , we said nothing ; marching alongside or one behind the other , each with a set countenance : I , angry and proud , and drawing what strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings ; Alan angry and ashamed , ashamed that he had lost my money , angry that I should take it so ill ."
"The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind ; and the more I approved of it , the more ashamed I grew of my approval ."
"It would be a fine , handsome , generous thing , indeed , for Alan to turn round and say to me : `` Go , I am in the most danger , and my company only increases yours . ''"
"But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me , and say to him : `` You are in great danger , I am in but little ; your friendship is a burden ; go , take your risks and bear your hardships alone -- '' no , that was impossible ; and even to think of it privily to myself , made my cheeks to burn ."
"And yet Alan had behaved like a child , and -LRB- what is worse -RRB- a treacherous child ."
"Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft ; and yet here he was trudging by my side , without a penny to his name , and by what I could see , quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg ."
"True , I was ready to share it with him ; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness ."
These were the two things uppermost in my mind ; and I could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity .
"So I did the next worst , and said nothing , nor so much as looked once at my companion , save with the tail of my eye ."
"At last , upon the other side of Loch Errocht , going over a smooth , rushy place , where the walking was easy , he could bear it no longer , and came close to me ."
"`` David , '' says he , `` this is no way for two friends to take a small accident ."
I have to say that I 'm sorry ; and so that 's said .
"And now if you have anything , ye 'd better say it . ''"
"`` O , '' says I , `` I have nothing . ''"
He seemed disconcerted ; at which I was meanly pleased .
"`` No , '' said he , with rather a trembling voice , `` but when I say I was to blame ? ''"
"`` Why , of course , ye were to blame , '' said I , coolly ; `` and you will bear me out that I have never reproached you . ''"
"`` Never , '' says he ; `` but ye ken very well that ye 've done worse ."
Are we to part ?
Ye said so once before .
Are ye to say it again ?
"Tommy in bed , Teddy wheezing like a little grampus , Mrs. Jo quite used up , and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once , and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins ."
"Under his quiet management things soon fell into order , for every one felt that he was equal to a dozen conflagrations , and worked with a will at whatever task he gave them ."
"There was no school that morning , but by afternoon the damaged room was put to rights , the invalids were better , and there was time to hear and judge the little culprits quietly ."
"Nat and Tommy told their parts in the mischief , and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the dear old house and all in it ."
"But Dan put on his devil-may-care look , and would not own that there was much harm done ."
"Now , of all things , Mr. Bhaer hated drinking , gambling , and swearing ; smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it , and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy , with whom he had tried to be most forbearing , should take advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden vices , and teach his innocent little lads to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them ."
"He talked long and earnestly to the assembled boys , and ended by saying , with an air of mingled firmness and regret , `` I think Tommy is punished enough , and that scar on his arm will remind him for a long time to let these things alone ."
"Nat 's fright will do for him , for he is really sorry , and does try to obey me ."
"But you , Dan , have been many times forgiven , and yet it does no good ."
"I can not have my boys hurt by your bad example , nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears , so you can say good-bye to them all , and tell Nursey to put up your things in my little black bag . ''"
`` Oh !
"sir , where is he going ? ''"
cried Nat .
"`` To a pleasant place up in the country , where I sometimes send boys when they do n't do well here ."
"Mr. Page is a kind man , and Dan will be happy there if he chooses to do his best . ''"
`` Will he ever come back ? ''
asked Demi .
`` That will depend on himself ; I hope so . ''
"As he spoke , Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page , and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions ."
"`` I wonder if you 'll like it , '' began Jack ."
"`` Sha n't stay if I do n't , '' said Dan coolly ."
`` Where will you go ? ''
asked Nat .
"`` I may go to sea , or out west , or take a look at California , '' answered Dan , with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little boys ."
"`` Oh , do n't !"
"stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here ; do , Dan , '' pleaded Nat , much affected at the whole affair ."
"`` I do n't care where I go , or how long I stay , and I 'll be hanged if I ever come back here , '' with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up his things , every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him ."
"That was the only good-bye he gave the boys , for they were all talking the matter over in the barn when he came down , and he told Nat not to call them ."
"The wagon stood at the door , and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak to Dan , looking so sad that his heart smote him , and he said in a low tone , `` May I say good-bye to Teddy ? ''"
"`` Yes , dear ; go in and kiss him , he will miss his Danny very much . ''"
"No one saw the look in Dan 's eyes as he stooped over the crib , and saw the little face light up at first sight of him , but he heard Mrs. Bhaer say pleadingly , `` Ca n't we give the poor lad one more trial , Fritz ? ''"
"and Mr. Bhaer answer in his steady way , `` My dear , it is not best , so let him go where he can do no harm to others , while they do good to him , and by and by he shall come back , I promise you . ''"
"` No , I did not , ' she answered ; ` the girl went off with your dinner ."
"She must have lost her way , but will no doubt come back to-morrow . '"
"But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood , and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food . '"
"I will take a bag of lentils , ' said he ; ` they are larger than millet , and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way . '"
"At midday the maiden took the food , but the lentils had all gone ; as on the previous day , the wood birds had eaten them all ."
"The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall , when she came in the same way to the old man 's house , and asked for food and a night 's lodging ."
"The man with the white hair again asked the beasts : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The beasts answered , ` Duks , ' and everything happened as on the former day ."
"The girl cooked a good meal , ate and drank with the old man , and did not trouble herself about the animals ."
"And when she asked for a bed , they replied : You have eaten with him You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Now sleep as you ought !"
"And when she was asleep , the old man shook his head over her , and let her fall into the cellar ."
"On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife , ` Send our youngest child to-day with my dinner ."
"She is always good and obedient , and will keep to the right path , and not wander away like her sisters , idle drones ! '"
"But the mother said , ` Must I lose my dearest child too ? '"
"` Do not fear , ' he answered ; ` she is too clever and intelligent to lose her way ."
"I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along ; they are even larger than lentils , and will show her the way . '"
"But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm , the wood pigeons had eaten up the peas , and she did not know which way to go ."
"She was much distressed , and thought constantly of her poor hungry father and her anxious mother ."
"At last , when it grew dark , she saw the little light , and came to the house in the wood ."
"She asked prettily if she might stay there for the night , and the man with the white beard asked his beasts again : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' they said ."
"Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the animals were lying , and stroked the cock and the hen , and scratched the brindled cow between its horns ."
"And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper , and the dishes were standing on the table , she said , ` Shall I have plenty while the good beasts have nothing ?"
There is food to spare outside ; I will attend to them first . '
"Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and hen , and brought the cow an armful of sweet-smelling hay ."
"` Eat that , dear beasts , ' she said , ' and when you are thirsty you shall have a good drink . '"
"Then she fetched a bowl of water , and the cock and hen flew on to the edge , put their beaks in , and then held up their heads as birds do when they drink , and the brindled cow also drank her fill ."
"When the beasts were satisfied , the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and ate what was left for her ."
"Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their heads under their wings , and the brindled cow blinked its eyes , so the maiden said , ` Shall we not go to rest now ? '"
"Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The animals said , ` Duks : You have eaten with us , You have drunk with us , You have tended us right , So we wish you good night . '"
"The maiden therefore went upstairs , made the bed and put on clean sheets and fell asleep ."
He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion .
Then he went on ticking .
Chapter 15 `` HOOK OR ME THIS TIME '' Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened .
"Thus , to take an instance , we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we do n't know how long , but , say , half an hour ."
Now such an experience had come that night to Peter .
When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready .
"He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it , but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking ."
"At first he thought this eerie , but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down ."
"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion , Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use ; and he decided to tick , so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested ."
"He ticked superbly , but with one unforeseen result ."
"The crocodile was among those who heard the sound , and it followed him , though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost , or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself , will never be certainly known , for , like slaves to a fixed idea , it was a stupid beast ."
"Peter reached the shore without mishap , and went straight on , his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element ."
"Thus many animals pass from land to water , but no other human of whom I know ."
As he swam he had but one thought : `` Hook or me this time . ''
He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it .
"Had he known he would have stopped , for to board the brig by help of the tick , though an ingenious idea , had not occurred to him ."
"On the contrary , he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse ; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him , with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile ."
The crocodile !
No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking .
"At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile , and he looked behind him swiftly ."
"Then he realised that he was doing it himself , and in a flash he understood the situation ."
`` How clever of me ! ''
"he thought at once , and signed to the boys not to burst into applause ."
It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck .
"Now , reader , time what happened by your watch ."
Peter struck true and deep .
John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate 's mouth to stifle the dying groan .
He fell forward .
Four boys caught him to prevent the thud .
"Peter gave the signal , and the carrion was cast overboard ."
"There was a splash , and then silence ."
How long has it taken ?
He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding .
"It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him -- the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable , and gave her power to smile -- and even to laugh a little ."
"When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears , but not while he was here ."
"She would not even let herself cry at night , lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning ."
"On his last evening at home they went together to Rainbow Valley and sat down on the bank of the brook , under the White Lady , where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless years ."
"Rainbow Valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night ; a wonderful grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it ; and then came moonshine , hinting , hiding , revealing , lighting up little dells and hollows here , leaving others in dark , velvet shadow ."
"`` When I am ` somewhere in France , ' '' said Walter , looking around him with eager eyes on all the beauty his soul loved , `` I shall remember these still , dewy , moon-drenched places ."
The balsam of the fir-trees ; the peace of those white pools of moonshine ; the ` strength of the hills ' -- what a beautiful old Biblical phrase that is .
Rilla !
"Look at those old hills around us -- the hills we looked up at as children , wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them ."
How calm and strong they are -- how patient and changeless -- like the heart of a good woman .
"Rilla-my-Rilla , do you know what you have been to me the past year ?"
I want to tell you before I go .
"I could not have lived through it if it had not been for you , little loving , believing heart . ''"
Rilla dared not try to speak .
She slipped her hand into Walter 's and pressed it hard .
"`` And when I 'm over there , Rilla , in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten God have made , it will be the thought of you that will help me most ."
I know you 'll be as plucky and patient as you have shown yourself to be this past year -- I 'm not afraid for you .
"I know that no matter what happens , you 'll be Rilla-my-Rilla -- no matter what happens . ''"
"Rilla repressed tear and sigh , but she could not repress a little shiver , and Walter knew that he had said enough ."
"After a moment of silence , in which each made an unworded promise to each other , he said , `` Now we wo n't be sober any more ."
We 'll look beyond the years -- to the time when the war will be over and Jem and Jerry and I will come marching home and we 'll all be happy again . ''
"`` We wo n't be -- happy -- in the same way , '' said Rilla ."
"`` No , not in the same way ."
Nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way .
"But it will be a better happiness , I think , little sister -- a happiness we 've earned ."
"We were very happy before the war , were n't we ?"
"With a home like Ingleside , and a father and mother like ours we could n't help being happy ."
But that happiness was a gift from life and love ; it was n't really ours -- life could take it back at any time .
It can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty .
I 've realised that since I went into khaki .
"In spite of my occasional funks , when I fall to living over things beforehand , I 've been happy since that night in May ."
"The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide , low-ceilinged living room , furnished with simplicity and good taste ."
"Leaving the two men there , Lynde and the old cousin vanished , and Alan found himself talking freely with the Captain who could , as it appeared , talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds ."
"He was evidently a clever , self-educated man , somewhat opinionated and given to sarcasm ; he never made any references to his own past life or experiences , but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in politics and science ."
"Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like , but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to expect that he was not inclined to be over critical ."
"At least , this was what he honestly thought ."
He did not suspect that it was because this man was Lynde 's father that he wished to think as well as possible of him .
Presently Lynde came in .
"She had changed her outdoor dress , stained with moss and soil in her fall , for a soft clinging garment of some pale yellow material , and her long , thick braid of hair hung over her shoulder ."
She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed to her .
Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table .
"She was as grim and unsmiling as ever , yet she cast a look of satisfaction on Alan as she passed out ."
"One dog lay down at Lynde 's feet , the other sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap ."
"Rexton and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away from Alan , and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream ."
When he went away the Captain invited him back .
"`` If you like to come , that is , '' he said brusquely , `` and always as the man , not the priest , remember ."
I do n't want you by and by to be slyly slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges .
You 'll waste your time if you do .
"Come as man to man and you 'll be welcome , for I like you -- and it 's few men I like ."
But do n't try to talk religion to me . ''
"`` I never talk religion , '' said Alan emphatically ."
`` I try to live it .
"I 'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary , sir , but I shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my reverence for my vocation demands ."
"If I respect your beliefs , whatever they may be , I shall expect you to respect mine , Captain Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't insult your God , '' said the Captain with a faint sneer ."
Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings .
"He did not altogether like Captain Anthony -- that was very clear to him , and yet there was something about the man that attracted him ."
"Intellectually he was a worthy foeman , and Alan had often longed for such since coming to Rexton ."
"He missed the keen , stimulating debates of his college days and , now there seemed a chance of renewing them , he was eager to grasp it ."
And Lynde -- how beautiful she was !
What though she shared -- as was not unlikely -- in her father 's lack of belief ?
She could not be essentially irreligious -- that were impossible in a true woman .
Might not this be his opportunity to help her -- to lead her into dearer light ?
Its name is Ben Alder .
"it is a wild , desert mountain full of hills and hollows , and if we can win to it before the morn , we may do yet . ''"
"`` But , Alan , '' cried I , `` that will take us across the very coming of the soldiers ! ''"
"`` I ken that fine , '' said he ; `` but if we are driven back on Appin , we are two dead men ."
"So now , David man , be brisk ! ''"
"With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an incredible quickness , as though it were his natural way of going ."
"All the time , too , he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the moorland where we were the best concealed ."
"Some of these had been burned or at least scathed with fire ; and there rose in our faces -LRB- which were close to the ground -RRB- a blinding , choking dust as fine as smoke ."
"The water was long out ; and this posture of running on the hands and knees brings an overmastering weakness and weariness , so that the joints ache and the wrists faint under your weight ."
"Now and then , indeed , where was a big bush of heather , we lay awhile , and panted , and putting aside the leaves , looked back at the dragoons ."
"They had not spied us , for they held straight on ; a half-troop , I think , covering about two miles of ground , and beating it mighty thoroughly as they went ."
"I had awakened just in time ; a little later , and we must have fled in front of them , instead of escaping on one side ."
"Even as it was , the least misfortune might betray us ; and now and again , when a grouse rose out of the heather with a clap of wings , we lay as still as the dead and were afraid to breathe ."
"The aching and faintness of my body , the labouring of my heart , the soreness of my hands , and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes , had soon grown to be so unbearable that I would gladly have given up ."
Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me enough of a false kind of courage to continue .
"As for himself -LRB- and you are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat -RRB- he had first turned crimson , but as time went on the redness began to be mingled with patches of white ; his breath cried and whistled as it came ; and his voice , when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts , sounded like nothing human ."
"Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits , nor did he at all abate in his activity , so that I was driven to marvel at the man 's endurance ."
"At length , in the first gloaming of the night , we heard a trumpet sound , and looking back from among the heather , saw the troop beginning to collect ."
"A little after , they had built a fire and camped for the night , about the middle of the waste ."
At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep .
`` There shall be no sleep the night ! ''
said Alan .
"`` From now on , these weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland , and none will get out of Appin but winged fowls ."
"We got through in the nick of time , and shall we jeopard what we 've gained ?"
"Na , na , when the day comes , it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder . ''"
"`` Alan , '' I said , `` it 's not the want of will : it 's the strength that I want ."
"If I could , I would ; but as sure as I 'm alive I can not . ''"
"`` Very well , then , '' said Alan ."
`` I 'll carry ye . ''
"I looked to see if he were jesting ; but no , the little man was in dead earnest ; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me ."
`` Lead away ! ''
said I. `` I 'll follow . ''
"`` We all want to wear the nice things , so let us draw lots ."
Would n't that be the fairest way ? ''
"asked Merry , looking like a rosy little bride , under a great piece of illusion , which had done duty in many plays ."
"`` The Prince is light , so the Princess must be darkish ."
"We ought to choose the girl who will look best , as it is a picture ."
"I heard Miss Delano say so , when the ladies got up the tableaux , last winter , and every one wanted to be Cleopatra , '' said Jill decidedly ."
"`` You choose , and then if we ca n't agree we will draw lots , '' proposed Susy , who , being plain , knew there was little hope of her getting a chance in any other way ."
"So all stood in a row , and Jill , from her sofa , surveyed them critically , feeling that the one Jack would really prefer was not among the number ."
"`` I choose that one , for Juliet wants to be Queen , Molly would make faces , and the others are too big or too light , '' pronounced Jill , pointing to Merry , who looked pleased , while Mabel 's face darkened , and Susy gave a disdainful sniff ."
"`` You 'd better draw lots , and then there will be no fuss ."
"Ju and I are out of the fight , but you three can try , and let this settle the matter , '' said Molly , handing Jill a long strip of paper ."
"All agreed to let it be so , and when the bits were ready drew in turn ."
"This time fate was evidently on Merry 's side , and no one grumbled when she showed the longest paper ."
"`` Go and dress , then come back , and we 'll plan how we are to be placed before we call up the boys , '' commanded Jill , who was manager , since she could be nothing else ."
"The girls retired to the bedroom and began to `` rig up , '' as they called it ; but discontent still lurked among them , and showed itself in sharp words , envious looks , and disobliging acts ."
`` Am I to have the white silk and the feather ? ''
"asked Merry , delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the graceful droop of the other , though both were rather shabby ."
`` You can use your own dress .
"I do n't see why you should have everything , '' answered Susy , who was at the mirror , putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head , bound to be gay since she could not be pretty ."
"`` I think I 'd better keep the plume , as I have n't anything else that is nice , and I 'm afraid Emma would n't like me to lend it , '' added Annette , who was disappointed that Mabel was not to be the Beauty . ''"
I do n't intend to act at all ! ''
"declared Mabel , beginning to braid up her hair with a jerk , out of humor with the whole affair . ''"
"I think you are a set of cross , selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you ca n't all have the best part ."
I 'm ashamed of you ! ''
"scolded Molly , standing by Merry , who was sadly surveying her mother 's old purple silk , which looked like brown in the evening ."
"`` I 'm going to have Miss Delano 's red brocade for the Queen , and I shall ask her for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to get mine , and tell her how mean you are , '' said Juliet , frowning under her gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-cloth for train till the brocade arrived ."
"`` Perhaps you 'd like to have Mabel cut her hair off , so Merry can have that , too ? ''"
"cried Susy , with whom hair was a tender point ."
"`` Light hair is n't wanted , so Ju will have to give hers , or you 'd better borrow Miss Bat 's frisette , '' added Mabel , with a scornful laugh ."
`` I just wish Miss Bat was here to give you girls a good shaking .
"Do let someone else have a chance at the glass , you peacock ! ''"
"exclaimed Molly Loo , pushing Susy aside to arrange her own blue turban , out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give Merry ."
"The fight lasted all day , and the prince 's strength was well-nigh spent , when the dragon , thinking that the victory was won , opened his jaws to give a roar of triumph ."
"The prince saw his chance , and before his foe could shut his mouth again had plunged his sword far down his adversary 's throat ."
"There was a desperate clutching of the claws to the earth , a slow flagging of the great wings , then the monster rolled over on his side and moved no more ."
Muffette was delivered .
After this they all went back to the palace .
"The marriage took place the following day , and Muffette and her husband lived happy for ever after ."
"The Adventures of Covan the Brown-Haired -LSB- From Les Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-"
"On the shores of the west , where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea , dwelt a goatherd and his wife , together with their three sons and one daughter ."
"All day long the young men fished and hunted , while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain , or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets ."
"For several years they all lived happily together , when one day , as the girl was out on the hill with the kids , the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping , creeping up from the sea ."
"She rose with a shiver , and tried to call to her kids , but the voice died away in her throat , and strong arms seemed to hold her ."
Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not .
"Many times the father and brothers jumped up , thinking they heard her steps , but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands , nor could they tell where the river lay , nor where the mountain ."
"One by one the kids came home , and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door , but no sound broke the stillness ."
"Through the night no one slept , and when morning broke and the mist rolled back , they sought the maiden by sea and by land , but never a trace of her could be found anywhere ."
"Thus a year and a day slipped by , and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old ."
"Their sons too were sadder than before , for they loved their sister well , and had never ceased to mourn for her ."
"At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said : ` It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us , and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return ."
"Surely some evil has befallen her , or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest ; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till , living or dead , I have found her . '"
"` If you have vowed , then must you keep your vow , ' answered Gorla ."
` But better had it been if you had first asked your father 's leave before you made it .
"Yet , since it is so , your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey ."
Who can tell how long it may be ? '
"So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two , a big one and a little one ."
"` Choose , my son , ' said she ."
"` Will you have the little cake with your mother 's blessing , or the big one without it , in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow ? ' '"
"I will have the large cake , ' answered the youth ; ` for what good would my mother 's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger ? '"
And taking the big cake he went his way .
"Straight on he strode , letting neither hill nor river hinder him ."
Swiftly he walked -- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain .
"The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed , leaving the deer behind him ; but at length he stopped , for hunger had seized on him , and he could walk no more ."
Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake .
"The country round was covered with forests , in which dwelt all kinds of wild beasts , and the young man and his companions used to spend whole days in hunting them , and he was the finest hunter of all the tribe ."
"One morning , when winter was coming on , the youth and his companions set off as usual to bring back some of the mountain goats and deer to be salted down , as he was afraid of a snow-storm ; and if the wind blew and the snow drifted the forest might be impassable for some weeks ."
"The old man and the wife , however , would not go out , but remained in the wigwam making bows and arrows ."
"It soon grew so cold in the forest that at last one of the men declared they could walk no more , unless they could manage to warm themselves ."
"` That is easily done , ' said the leader , giving a kick to a large tree ."
"Flames broke out in the trunk , and before it had burnt up they were as hot as if it had been summer ."
"Then they started off to the place where the goats and deer were to be found in the greatest numbers , and soon had killed as many as they wanted ."
"But the leader killed most , as he was the best shot ."
"` Now we must cut up the game and divide it , ' said he ; and so they did , each one taking his own share ; and , walking one behind the other , set out for the village ."
"But when they reached a great river the young man did not want the trouble of carrying his pack any further , and left it on the bank . '"
"I am going home another way , ' he told his companions ."
And taking another road he reached the village long before they did .
` Have you returned with empty hands ? '
"asked the old man , as his son opened the door ."
"` Have I ever done that , that you put me such a question ? '"
asked the youth .
"` No ; I have slain enough to feast us for many moons , but it was heavy , and I left the pack on the bank of the great river ."
"Give me the arrows , I will finish making them , and you can go to the river and bring home the pack ! '"
"So the old man rose and went , and strapped the meat on his shoulder ; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river ."
"He stooped to catch it , but it swirled past him ."
"He clutched again ; but in doing so he over-balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids , where he was knocked against some rocks , and he sank and was drowned , and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again ."
"But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man , and was changed into a piece of wood ."
"The wood floated on , and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country ."
"There it was borne by the current close to the shore , and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed , and drew it out , saying to herself : ` What a nice smooth plank !"
I will use it as a table to put my food upon . '
And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut .
"When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof , and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good ."
"The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry , so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot ."
But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her !
"` Oh , you horrid plank , you have brought me ill-luck ! '"
she cried .
And taking it up she flung it away from her .
"`` Consider , '' cried Mrs. Finch , `` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . ''"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"`` Try another drink , '' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"`` If , '' said he , `` a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . ''"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , `` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , '' they did what they should have done at first : chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"`` We are very busy people , '' they grumbled , `` and this would be a big job . ''"
"`` Quite so , '' said Solomon , `` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . ''
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
He sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !
"It was known afterward on the island as the Sparrows ' Year , and so , when you meet , as you doubtless sometimes do , grown-up people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labor , the boat was finished ."
"Oh , the deportment of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !"
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
`` B ... b ... but m ... m ... miss ... th ... th ... they 're ... '' gasped Joe in desperation .
"`` Joseph , are you going to obey me or are you NOT ? ''"
said Anne .
A bolder and more self-possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes .
This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before .
"Joe , with an agonized glance at St. Clair , went to the stove , opened the big , square front door , and threw the blue and white parcel in , before St. Clair , who had sprung to his feet , could utter a word ."
Then he dodged back just in time .
For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred .
"The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain Mrs. Hiram 's nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St. Clair Donnell 's father the day before , intending to have a birthday celebration that evening ."
"The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room , hissing and spluttering ."
Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks .
"Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St. Clair , helpless with laughter , rocked to and fro in the aisle ."
Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics .
"It seemed a long time , although it was really only a few minutes , before the last pinwheel subsided ."
"Anne , recovering herself , sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room ."
"Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch , where Barbara Shaw , in an agony of desire to be useful , poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillie 's face and shoulders before anyone could stop her ."
It was a full hour before quiet was restored ... but it was a quiet that might be felt .
Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teacher 's mental atmosphere .
"Nobody , except Anthony Pye , dared whisper a word ."
"Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum , caught Anne 's eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up ."
The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy .
The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives .
"Chester Sloane , spelling `` odoriferous '' with two f 's , was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it , either in this world or that which is to come ."
"Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea-tables , but the knowledge only angered her further ."
In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible ; so she ignored it in icy disdain .
When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pye 's .
"He peered across his book at Anne , his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery ."
"Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer , scampered over the desk , and leaped to the floor ."
"Anne screamed and sprang back , as if it had been a snake , and Anthony Pye laughed aloud ."
"Then a silence fell ... a very creepy , uncomfortable silence ."
"Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not , especially as she did n't know just where the mouse had gone ."
But she decided not to .
`` Now we must fly round and fill up .
"Come , boys , sort out the green and hand us the flowers as we want them ."
"Then we must direct them , and , by the time that is done , you can go and leave them , '' said Jill , setting all to work ."
`` Ed must choose his baskets first .
"These are ours ; but any of those you can have ; '' and Molly pointed to a detachment of gay baskets , set apart from those already partly filled ."
"Ed chose a blue one , and Merry filled it with the rosiest may-flowers , knowing that it was to hang on Mabel 's door-handle ."
"The others did the same , and the pretty work went on , with much fun , till all were filled , and ready for the names or notes ."
"`` Let us have poetry , as we ca n't get wild flowers ."
"That will be rather fine , '' proposed Jill , who liked jingles ."
"All had had some practice at the game parties , and pencils went briskly for a few minutes , while silence reigned , as the poets racked their brains for rhymes , and stared at the blooming array before them for inspiration ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"I ca n't find a word to rhyme to ` geranium , ' '' sighed Molly , pulling her braid , as if to pump the well of her fancy dry ."
"`` Cranium , '' said Frank , who was getting on bravely with `` Annette '' and `` violet . ''"
`` That is elegant ! ''
"and Molly scribbled away in great glee , for her poems were always funny ones ."
"`` How do you spell anemoly -- the wild flower , I mean ? ''"
"asked Jill , who was trying to compose a very appropriate piece for her best basket , and found it easier to feel love and gratitude than to put them into verse ."
"`` Anemone ; do spell it properly , or you 'll get laughed at , '' answered Gus , wildly struggling to make his lines express great ardor , without being `` too spoony , '' as he expressed it ."
"`` No , I should n't ."
"This person never laughs at other persons ' mistakes , as some persons do , '' replied Jill , with dignity ."
"Jack was desperately chewing his pencil , for he could not get on at all ; but Ed had evidently prepared his poem , for his paper was half full already , and Merry was smiling as she wrote a friendly line or two for Ralph 's basket , as she feared he would be forgotten , and knew he loved kindness even more than he did beauty ."
"`` Now let 's read them , '' proposed Molly , who loved to laugh even at herself ."
"The boys politely declined , and scrambled their notes into the chosen baskets in great haste ; but the girls were less bashful ."
"Jill was invited to begin , and gave her little piece , with the pink hyacinth basket before her , to illustrate her poem ."
"`` TO MY LADY `` There are no flowers in the fields , No green leaves on the tree , No columbines , no violets , No sweet anemone ."
"So I have gathered from my pots All that I have to fill The basket that I hang to-night , With heaps of love from Jill . ''"
`` That 's perfectly sweet !
"Mine is n't ; but I meant it to be funny , '' said Molly , as if there could be any doubt about the following ditty : -- `` Dear Grif , Here is a whiff Of beautiful spring flowers ; The big red rose Is for your nose , As toward the sky it towers ."
"`` Oh , do not frown Upon this crown Of green pinks and blue geranium But think of me When this you see , And put it on your cranium . ''"
"`` O Molly , you will never hear the last of that if Grif gets it , '' said Jill , as the applause subsided , for the boys pronounced it `` tip-top . ''"
"`` Do n't care , he gets the worst of it any way , for there is a pin in that rose , and if he goes to smell the mayflowers underneath he will find a thorn to pay for the tack he put in my rubber boot ."
"I know he will play me some joke to-night , and I mean to be first if I can , '' answered Molly , settling the artificial wreath round the orange-colored canoe which held her effusion ."
"By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king 's ears , and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody ."
So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him .
"And when the young man stood before the king , the king spoke to him and said , ` By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people , you have , in the eye of the law , forfeited your life ."
"But on one condition I will spare you , and that is , if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon ."
"Fail in this , and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '"
"` If that is all , ' said the youth , ` you shall soon have it . '"
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered .
"He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle , when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could ."
"Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable , and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse , ` What is the matter , my treasure ?"
is anything hurting you ? '
"After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse , but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise ."
"But when the same thing happened the third time , the dragon lost his temper , and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating ."
"This offended the horse and made him angry , and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head , he made no further fuss , but suffered himself to be led quietly away ."
"Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off , calling over his shoulder , ` Hi !"
dragon !
dragon !
"if anyone asks you what has become of your horse , you can say that I have got him ! '"
"But the king said , ` The flying horse is all very well , but I want something more ."
"You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
` Is that all ? '
answered the youth .
` That is easily done . '
And when night came he went away to the dragon 's house and climbed up on to the roof .
"Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung , and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up ."
"But the little bells all began to ring , and the dragon woke and said to his wife , ` Wife , you have pulled off all the bed-clothes ! '"
"and drew the covering towards him , pulling , as he did so , the young man into the room ."
"Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot , ` To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him , and when I get back we will eat him together . '"
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him .
"But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him , the prisoner caught her by the legs , threw her to the ground , seized her and speedily cut her throat , just as she had been about to do for him , and put her body in the oven ."
Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king .
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow .
"` That is not enough , ' said his majesty ; ` you must bring me the dragon himself , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
`` Wo n't it cost a great deal ? ''
"asked Merry , who , in spite of her little elegancies , had a good deal of her thrifty mother 's common sense ."
`` Yes ; and I 've got to earn it .
"But I can -- I know I can , for I 've saved some , and I shall work like ten beavers all summer ."
"I wo n't borrow if I can help it , but I know someone who would lend me five hundred if I wanted it ; '' and Ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks ."
`` I wish I had it to give you .
It must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance .
"And to travel , and see all the lovely pictures and statues , and people and places in Italy ."
How happy you must be ! ''
and Merry 's eyes had the wistful look they always wore when she dreamed dreams of the world she loved to live in .
`` I am -- so happy that I 'm afraid it never will happen .
"If I do go , I 'll write and tell you all about the fine sights , and how I get on ."
Would you like me to ? ''
"asked Ralph , beginning enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully , for he admired Merry very much , and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received ."
`` Indeed I should !
"I 'd feel so grand to have letters from Paris and Rome , and you 'd have so much to tell it would be almost as good as going myself , '' she said , looking off into the daffodil sky , as they paused a minute on the hill-top to get breath , for both had walked as fast as they talked ."
`` And will you answer the letters ? ''
"asked Ralph , watching the innocent face , which looked unusually kind and beautiful to him in that soft light ."
"`` Why , yes ; I 'd love to , only I shall not have anything interesting to say ."
What can I write about ? ''
and Merry smiled as she thought how dull her letters would sound after the exciting details his would doubtless give .
"`` Write about yourself , and all the rest of the people I know ."
"Grandma will be gone , and I shall want to hear how you get on . ''"
"Ralph looked very anxious indeed to hear , and Merry promised she would tell all about the other people , adding , as she turned from the evening peace and loveliness to the house , whence came the clatter of milk-pans and the smell of cooking , -- `` I never should have anything very nice to tell about myself , for I do n't do interesting things as you do , and you would n't care to hear about school , and sewing , and messing round at home . ''"
"Merry gave a disdainful little sniff at the savory perfume of ham which saluted them , and paused with her hand on the gate , as if she found it pleasanter out there than in the house ."
"Ralph seemed to agree with her , for , leaning on the gate , he lingered to say , with real sympathy in his tone and something else in his face , `` Yes , I should ; so you write and tell me all about it ."
"I did n't know you had any worries , for you always seemed like one of the happiest people in the world , with so many to pet and care for you , and plenty of money , and nothing very hard or hateful to do ."
"You 'd think you were well off if you knew as much about poverty and work and never getting what you want , as I do . ''"
`` You bear your worries so well that nobody knows you have them .
"I ought not to complain , and I wo n't , for I do have all I need ."
"I 'm so glad you are going to get what you want at last ; '' and Merry held out her hand to say good-night , with so much pleasure in her face that Ralph could not make up his mind to go just yet ."
"`` I shall have to scratch round in a lively way before I do get it , for David says a fellow ca n't live on less than four or five hundred a year , even living as poor artists have to , in garrets and on crusts ."
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , `` Oh , Brownie , how splendid ! ''"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say `` Oh dear ! ''"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie , too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates , she heard the murmur of an angry multitude , she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as `` Slay her ! ''
`` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! ''
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"`` Anything except that , '' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies chanted `` Anything except that . ''"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her , that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"`` I came back for my mother , '' he explained , `` to take her to the Neverland . ''"
"`` Yes , I know , '' Jane said , `` I have been waiting for you . ''"
"When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously , while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy ."
"`` She is my mother , '' Peter explained ; and Jane descended and stood by his side , with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him ."
"`` He does so need a mother , '' Jane said ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"Wendy admitted rather forlornly ; `` no one knows it so well as I. '' `` Good-bye , '' said Peter to Wendy ; and he rose in the air , and the shameless Jane rose with him ; it was already her easiest way of moving about ."
Wendy rushed to the window .
"`` No , no , '' she cried ."
"`` It is just for spring cleaning time , '' Jane said , `` he wants me always to do his spring cleaning . ''"
"`` If only I could go with you , '' Wendy sighed ."
"`` You see you ca n't fly , '' said Jane ."
Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together .
"Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window , watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars ."
"As you look at Wendy , you may see her hair becoming white , and her figure little again , for all this happened long ago ."
"Jane is now a common grown-up , with a daughter called Margaret ; and every spring cleaning time , except when he forgets , Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland , where she tells him stories about himself , to which he listens eagerly ."
"When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter , who is to be Peter 's mother in turn ; and thus it will go on , so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless ."
"_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens,_Version_1.txt.out"
I THE GRAND TOUR OF THE GARDENS You must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow Peter Pan 's adventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens .
"They are in London , where the King lives , and I used to take David there nearly every day unless he was looking decidedly flushed ."
"No child has ever been in the whole of the Gardens , because it is so soon time to turn back ."
"The reason it is soon time to turn back is that , if you are as small as David , you sleep from twelve to one ."
"If your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one , you could most likely see the whole of them ."
"The Gardens are bounded on one side by a never-ending line of omnibuses , over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds up her finger to any one of them it stops immediately ."
She then crosses with you in safety to the other side .
"There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate , but that is the one you go in at , and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons , who sits just outside ."
"This is as near to being inside as she may venture , because , if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment , the balloons would lift her up , and she would be flown away ."
"She sits very squat , for the balloons are always tugging at her , and the strain has given her quite a red face ."
"Once she was a new one , because the old one had let go , and David was very sorry for the old one , but as she did let go , he wished he had been there to see ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The Hump , which is the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run -RSB- The Gardens are a tremendous big place , with millions and hundreds of trees ; and first you come to the Figs , but you scorn to loiter there , for the Figs is the resort of superior little persons , who are forbidden to mix with the commonalty , and is so named , according to legend , because they dress in full fig ."
"These dainty ones are themselves contemptuously called Figs by David and other heroes , and you have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the Gardens when I tell you that cricket is called crickets here ."
"Occasionally a rebel Fig climbs over the fence into the world , and such a one was Miss Mabel Grey , of whom I shall tell you when we come to Miss Mabel Grey 's gate ."
You had better go there and look for it ; I have no more time to waste . '
And he went his way .
"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft , which was at the top of the storehouse , and there he found the wooden chest , so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces ."
` What use is this old thing to me ? '
he said to himself .
"` Oh , well , it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself ; so things might be worse after all . '"
"Placing the chest on his back , the man , whose name was Jose , set out for his inn , and , borrowing a hatchet , began to chop up the box ."
"In doing so he discovered a secret drawer , and in it lay a paper ."
"He opened the paper , not knowing what it might contain , and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father ."
"Putting the precious writing in his pocket , he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside , and he ran out at once in search of him ."
"The debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village ."
"He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed ."
"However , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one ."
"The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man ."
"A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly ."
"He stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison ."
"` Comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ` they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods ."
"I will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also ."
"And now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . '"
"And so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger ."
"But everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left ."
` What am I to do now ? '
said he to himself . '
"I think I had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '"
"At first he was only a servant , who carried the king the water for his bath , and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion ."
"But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him , and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber ."
"Now , when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited , and did not know how to make any for himself ."
"He then bethought him of the king 's favourite , and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother , whom he had so ill-used , would give him his protection , and find him a place ."
"The elder , who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf , and the next day the young man took up is work at court ."
"Unfortunately , the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself ."
"By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where ."
"` That will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands ."
"It stood wide open ; within , every corner of the pavement was crowded with fugitive burghers , surrounded by their families and laden with the most precious of their possessions , while , at the high altar , priests in full canonicals were imploring the mercy of God ."
"Even as Dick entered , the loud chorus began to thunder in the vaulted roofs ."
"He hurried through the groups of refugees , and came to the door of the stair that led into the steeple ."
And here a tall churchman stepped before him and arrested his advance .
"`` Whither , my son ? ''"
"he asked , severely ."
"`` My father , '' answered Dick , `` I am here upon an errand of expedition ."
Stay me not .
I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . ''
`` For my Lord of Gloucester ? ''
repeated the priest .
"`` Hath , then , the battle gone so sore ? ''"
"`` The battle , father , is at an end , Lancaster clean sped , my Lord of Risingham -- Heaven rest him !"
-- left upon the field .
"And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affairs . ''"
"And thrusting on one side the priest , who seemed stupefied at the news , Dick pushed open the door and rattled up the stairs four at a bound , and without pause or stumble , till he stepped upon the open platform at the top ."
"Shoreby Church tower not only commanded the town , as in a map , but looked far , on both sides , over sea and land ."
"It was now near upon noon ; the day exceeding bright , the snow dazzling ."
"And as Dick looked around him , he could measure the consequences of the battle ."
"A confused , growling uproar reached him from the streets , and now and then , but very rarely , the clash of steel ."
"Not a ship , not so much as a skiff remained in harbour ; but the sea was dotted with sails and row-boats laden with fugitives ."
"On shore , too , the surface of the snowy meadows was broken up with bands of horsemen , some cutting their way towards the borders of the forest , others , who were doubtless of the Yorkist side , stoutly interposing and beating them back upon the town ."
"Over all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fallen men and horses , clearly defined upon the snow ."
"To complete the picture , those of the foot soldiers as had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery combat on the borders of the port , and from the cover of the shoreside taverns ."
"In that quarter , also , one or two houses had been fired , and the smoke towered high in the frosty sunlight , and blew off to sea in voluminous folds ."
"Already close upon the margin of the woods , and somewhat in the line of Holywood , one particular clump of fleeing horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the tower ."
"It was fairly numerous ; in no other quarter of the field did so many Lancastrians still hold together ; thus they had left a wide , discoloured wake upon the snow , and Dick was able to trace them step by step from where they had left the town ."
"While Dick stood watching them , they had gained , unopposed , the first fringe of the leafless forest , and , turning a little from their direction , the sun fell for a moment full on their array , as it was relieved against the dusky wood ."
`` Murrey and blue ! ''
cried Dick .
`` I swear it -- murrey and blue ! ''
The next moment he was descending the stairway .
"`` Troth , no ! ''"
"And he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself , recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman ."
"James carried me accordingly into the kitchen , and sat down with me at table , smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner ."
"But presently the gloom returned upon him ; he sat frowning and biting his fingers ; only remembered me from time to time ; and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile , and back into his private terrors ."
"His wife sat by the fire and wept , with her face in her hands ; his eldest son was crouched upon the floor , running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end ; all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room , in a blind hurry of fear , and whimpering as she went ; and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard , and cry for orders ."
"At last James could keep his seat no longer , and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about ."
"`` I am but poor company altogether , sir , '' says he , `` but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident , and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons . ''"
A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept ; and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness .
He struck the lad repeatedly .
`` Are you gone gyte ? ''
* he cried .
`` Do you wish to hang your father ? ''
"and forgetful of my presence , carried on at him a long time together in the Gaelic , the young man answering nothing ; only the wife , at the name of hanging , throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before ."
* Mad .
"This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see ; and I was right glad when Alan returned , looking like himself in his fine French clothes , though -LRB- to be sure -RRB- they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine ."
"I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons , and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need , and a pair of Highland brogues made of deer-leather , rather strange at first , but after a little practice very easy to the feet ."
"By the time I came back Alan must have told his story ; for it seemed understood that I was to fly with him , and they were all busy upon our equipment ."
"They gave us each a sword and pistols , though I professed my inability to use the former ; and with these , and some ammunition , a bag of oatmeal , an iron pan , and a bottle of right French brandy , we were ready for the heather ."
"Money , indeed , was lacking ."
"I had about two guineas left ; Alan 's belt having been despatched by another hand , that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune ; and as for James , it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants , that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny , the most of it in coppers ."
"`` This 'll no do , '' said Alan ."
"`` Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by , '' said James , `` and get word sent to me ."
"Ye see , ye 'll have to get this business prettily off , Alan ."
This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two .
"They 're sure to get wind of ye , sure to seek ye , and by my way of it , sure to lay on ye the wyte of this day 's accident ."
"If it falls on you , it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country ."
"And if it comes on me -- '' he paused , and bit his fingers , with a white face ."
"`` It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang , '' said he ."
"`` It would be an ill day for Appin , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a day that sticks in my throat , '' said James ."
"`` O man , man , man -- man Alan !"
you and me have spoken like two fools ! ''
"It comes -- we may say -- he was your true companion ; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit , for I dare say you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows ."
"Well , well , these days are fortunately by ; and I think -LRB- speaking humanly -RRB- that you are near the end of your troubles . ''"
"As he thus moralised on my adventures , he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction ."
"I had been so long wandering with lawless people , and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky , that to sit once more in a clean , covered house , and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth , seemed mighty elevations ."
"Even as I thought so , my eye fell on my unseemly tatters , and I was once more plunged in confusion ."
But the lawyer saw and understood me .
"He rose , called over the stair to lay another plate , for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner , and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house ."
"Here he set before me water and soap , and a comb ; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son ; and here , with another apposite tag , he left me to my toilet ."
"CHAPTER XXVIII I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE I made what change I could in my appearance ; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past , and David Balfour come to life again ."
"And yet I was ashamed of the change too , and , above all , of the borrowed clothes ."
"When I had done , Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair , made me his compliments , and had me again into the cabinet ."
"`` Sit ye down , Mr. David , '' said he , `` and now that you are looking a little more like yourself , let me see if I can find you any news ."
"You will be wondering , no doubt , about your father and your uncle ?"
To be sure it is a singular tale ; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you .
"For , '' says he , really with embarrassment , `` the matter hinges on a love affair . ''"
"`` Truly , '' said I , `` I can not very well join that notion with my uncle . ''"
"`` But your uncle , Mr. David , was not always old , '' replied the lawyer , `` and what may perhaps surprise you more , not always ugly ."
"He had a fine , gallant air ; people stood in their doors to look after him , as he went by upon a mettle horse ."
"I have seen it with these eyes , and I ingenuously confess , not altogether without envy ; for I was a plain lad myself and a plain man 's son ; and in those days it was a case of Odi te , qui bellus es , Sabelle . ''"
"`` It sounds like a dream , '' said I. `` Ay , ay , '' said the lawyer , `` that is how it is with youth and age ."
"Nor was that all , but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future ."
"In 1715 , what must he do but run away to join the rebels ?"
"It was your father that pursued him , found him in a ditch , and brought him back multum gementem ; to the mirth of the whole country ."
"However , majora canamus -- the two lads fell in love , and that with the same lady ."
"Mr. Ebenezer , who was the admired and the beloved , and the spoiled one , made , no doubt , mighty certain of the victory ; and when he found he had deceived himself , screamed like a peacock ."
"The whole country heard of it ; now he lay sick at home , with his silly family standing round the bed in tears ; now he rode from public-house to public-house , and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom , Dick , and Harry ."
"Your father , Mr. David , was a kind gentleman ; but he was weak , dolefully weak ; took all this folly with a long countenance ; and one day -- by your leave !"
-- resigned the lady .
"She was no such fool , however ; it 's from her you must inherit your excellent good sense ; and she refused to be bandied from one to another ."
Both got upon their knees to her ; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door .
That was in August ; dear me !
the same year I came from college .
"In the first place , Miranda , in spite of her dress and veil , was such a flat-faced , commonplace , uninteresting little bride ."
"In the second place , Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony , and this vexed Miranda unreasonably ."
"Long afterwards she told Rilla , `` I just felt like saying to him then and there , ` If you feel so bad over having to marry me you do n't have to . '"
But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me . ''
"In the third place , Jims , who was usually so well-behaved in public , took a fit of shyness and contrariness combined and began to cry at the top of his voice for `` Willa . ''"
"Nobody wanted to take him out , because everybody wanted to see the marriage , so Rilla who was a bridesmaid , had to take him and hold him during the ceremony ."
"In the fourth place , Sir Wilfrid Laurier took a fit ."
Sir Wilfrid was entrenched in a corner of the room behind Miranda 's piano .
"During his seizure he made the weirdest , most unearthly noises ."
"He would begin with a series of choking , spasmodic sounds , continuing into a gruesome gurgle , and ending up with a strangled howl ."
"Nobody could hear a word Mr. Meredith was saying , except now and then , when Sir Wilfrid stopped for breath ."
"Nobody looked at the bride except Susan , who never dragged her fascinated eyes from Miranda 's face -- all the others were gazing at the dog ."
Miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as Sir Wilfrid began his performance she forgot it .
All that she could think of was that her dear dog was dying and she could not go to him .
She never remembered a word of the ceremony .
"Rilla , who in spite of Jims , had been trying her best to look rapt and romantic , as beseemed a war bridesmaid , gave up the hopeless attempt , and devoted her energies to choking down untimely merriment ."
"She dared not look at anybody in the room , especially Mrs. Dead Angus , for fear all her suppressed mirth should suddenly explode in a most un-young-ladylike yell of laughter ."
"But married they were , and then they had a wedding-supper in the dining-room which was so lavish and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a month 's labour ."
Everybody had brought something .
"Mrs. Dead Angus had brought a large apple-pie , which she placed on a chair in the dining-room and then absently sat down on it ."
"Neither her temper nor her black silk wedding garment was improved thereby , but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast ."
Mrs. Dead Angus eventually took it home with her again .
"Whiskers-on-the-moon 's pacifist pig should not get it , anyhow ."
"That evening Mr. and Mrs. Joe , accompanied by the recovered Sir Wilfrid , departed for the Four Winds Lighthouse , which was kept by Joe 's uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief honeymoon ."
"Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes , tidied up , left a cold supper and Miranda 's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor , and walked home , while the mystic veil of dreamy , haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen ."
"`` I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself , '' remarked Susan sentimentally ."
But Rilla felt rather flat -- perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirty-six hours .
"She was disappointed somehow -- the whole affair had been so ludicrous , and Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace ."
"`` If Miranda had n't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he would n't have had that fit , '' she said crossly ."
"`` I warned her -- but she said she could n't starve the poor dog -- he would soon be all she had left , etc. ."
I could have shaken her . ''
"`` The best man was more excited than Joe was , '' said Susan ."
"`` Well , I reckon it 's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , '' he replied ; `` so it 's strong , and plenty of it , what 's the odds ? ''"
"`` All right , '' I answered ."
"`` I 'll bring you port , Mr. Hands ."
But I 'll have to dig for it . ''
"With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion ."
"I knew he would not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true ."
"He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved -- for I could hear him stifle a groan -- yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck ."
"In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood ."
"He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark ."
This was all that I required to know .
"Israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that I was meant to be the victim ."
"What he would do afterwards -- whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him -- was , of course , more than I could say ."
"Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner ."
"We both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared ."
"While I was thus turning the business over in my mind , I had not been idle with my body ."
"I had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , I made my reappearance on the deck ."
"Hands lay as I had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light ."
"He looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of `` Here 's luck ! ''"
"Then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid ."
"`` Cut me a junk o ' that , '' says he , `` for I have n't no knife and hardly strength enough , so be as I had ."
"Ah , Jim , Jim , I reckon I 've missed stays !"
"Cut me a quid , as 'll likely be the last , lad , for I 'm for my long home , and no mistake . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 'll cut you some tobacco , but if I was you and thought myself so badly , I would go to my prayers like a Christian man . ''"
`` Why ? ''
said he .
"`` Now , you tell me why . ''"
`` Why ? ''
I cried .
`` You were asking me just now about the dead .
"You 've broken your trust ; you 've lived in sin and lies and blood ; there 's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment , and you ask me why !"
"For God 's mercy , Mr. Hands , that 's why . ''"
"I spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with ."
"`` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , '' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"`` And it might melt , '' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"`` Build a house round her , '' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely .
"One of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it , leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"`` Now we fear it is quite finished , '' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"`` That certainly finishes it , '' they cried reluctantly ."
"`` Not at all , '' cried a glow-worm , `` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . ''"
"`` Wait one moment , '' said a china merchant , `` and I shall make you a saucer . ''"
"Now alas , it was absolutely finished ."
"Oh , dear no !"
"`` Gracious me , '' cried a brass manufacturer , `` there 's no handle on the door , '' and he put one on ."
An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat .
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
`` Finished !
"how can it be finished , '' the plumber demanded scornfully , `` before hot and cold are put in ? ''"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , `` Tony , '' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"`` Mr. Hyde told me ; he 's been among 'em , and can talk their talk , and likes 'em , '' began Dan , flattered by their attention , but rather embarrassed by having a grown-up listener ."
`` What is wampum for ? ''
"asked curious Demi , from his perch ."
"The others asked questions likewise , and , before he knew it , Dan was reeling off all Mr. Hyde had told him , as they sailed down the river a few weeks before ."
"Mr. Laurie listened well , but found the boy more interesting than the Indians , for Mrs. Jo had told him about Dan , and he rather took a fancy to the wild lad , who ran away as he himself had often longed to do , and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and patience ."
"`` I 've been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own ; a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find , and make , and have given you ."
"Mrs. Jo is too kind to complain , but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps , half-a-pint of dor-bugs in one of her best vases , for instance , a couple of dead bats nailed up in the back entry , wasps nests tumbling down on people 's heads , and stones lying round everywhere , enough to pave the avenue ."
"There are not many women who would stand that sort of thing , are there , now ? ''"
"As Mr. Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes , the boys laughed and nudged one another , for it was evident that some one told tales out of school , else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient treasures ."
"`` Where can we put them , then ? ''"
"said Demi , crossing his legs and leaning down to argue the question ."
`` In the old carriage-house . ''
"`` But it leaks , and there is n't any window , nor any place to put things , and it 's all dust and cobwebs , '' began Nat ."
"`` Wait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit , and then see how you like it ."
"He is to come over on Monday to get it ready ; then next Saturday I shall come out , and we will fix it up , and make the beginning , at least , of a fine little museum ."
"Every one can bring his things , and have a place for them ; and Dan is to be the head man , because he knows most about such matters , and it will be quiet , pleasant work for him now that he ca n't knock about much . ''"
`` Wo n't that be jolly ? ''
"cried Nat , while Dan smiled all over his face and had not a word to say , but hugged his book , and looked at Mr. Laurie as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever blessed the world ."
"`` Shall I go round again , sir ? ''"
"asked Peter , as they came to the gate , after two slow turns about the half-mile triangle ."
"`` No , we must be prudent , else we ca n't come again ."
"I must go over the premises , take a look at the carriage-house , and have a little talk with Mrs. Jo before I go ; '' and , having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and enjoy his book , Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who were raging about the place in search of him ."
"Leaving the little girls to mess up-stairs , Mrs. Bhaer sat down by Dan , and listened to his eager account of the drive till the flock returned , dusty , warm , and much excited about the new museum , which every one considered the most brilliant idea of the age ."
"`` I always wanted to endow some sort of an institution , and I am going to begin with this , '' said Mr. Laurie , sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo 's feet ."
`` You have endowed one already .
What do you call this ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo pointed to the happy-faced lads , who had camped upon the floor about him ."
"`` I call it a very promising Bhaer-garden , and I 'm proud to be a member of it ."
Did you know I was the head boy in this school ? ''
"he asked , turning to Dan , and changing the subject skilfully , for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did ."
`` I thought Franz was ! ''
"answered Dan , wondering what the man meant ."
Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds .
"In return , the birds taught them many things : how to get up early in the morning , how to sing , and how to talk their language , which very few people know ."
"But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster-brothers , it was very difficult always to keep the peace ."
"Matters got worse and worse till , one morning , the eldest boy said to the twins : ` It is all very well for you to pretend that you have such good manners , and are so much better than we , but we have at least a father and mother , while you have only got the river , like the toads and the frogs . '"
The poor children did not answer the insult ; but it made them very unhappy .
"And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer , but must go into the world and seek their fortunes ."
So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them .
"One window was open , and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river ."
"Then , feeling as if they had found a friend , they walked along its banks , hoping that by-and-by they should meet some one to take care of them ."
"The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature , till , in the evening , weary and footsore , they saw before them a small hut ."
"This raised their spirits for a moment ; but the door was shut , and the hut seemed empty , and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried ."
"However , the boy fought down his tears , and said cheerfully : ` Well , at any rate here is a bench where we can sit down , and when we are rested we will think what is best to do next . '"
"Then they sat down , and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything ; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting , chattering merrily to each other ."
"Of course the swallows had no idea that the children understood their language , or they would not have talked so freely ; but , as it was , they said whatever came into their heads ."
"` Good evening , my fine city madam , ' remarked a swallow , whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished ."
"` Happy , indeed , are the eyes that behold you !"
"Only think of your having returned to your long-forgotten country friends , after you have lived for years in a palace ! ' '"
"I have inherited this nest from my parents , ' replied the other , ` and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home ."
"But , ' she added politely , ' I hope that you and all your family are well ? '"
"` Very well indeed , I am glad to say ."
"But my poor daughter had , a short time ago , such bad inflammation in her eyes that she would have gone blind had I not been able to find the magic herb , which cured her at once . '"
` And how is the nightingale singing ?
Does the lark soar as high as ever ?
And does the linnet dress herself as smartly ? '
But here the country swallow drew herself up . '
"I never talk gossip , ' she said severely ."
"` Our people , who were once so innocent and well-behaved , have been corrupted by the bad examples of men ."
It is a thousand pities . '
` What !
"innocence and good behaviour are not to be met with among birds , nor in the country !"
"My dear friend , what are you saying ? '"
` The truth and nothing more .
`` Now you 've done it !
I 'll give you a good thrashing when I get back ! ''
"roared Gus , shaking his fist at Joe , who stood staring , half-pleased , half-scared , at what he had done ."
`` Are you really going to try it ? ''
"asked Gus , as they glided on with increasing speed , and he , too , felt the charm of such a novel adventure , though the consequences bid fair to be serious ."
"`` Yes , I am , '' answered Frank , with the grim look he always wore when his strong will got the upper hand ."
"`` Bill will give it to us , any way , so we may as well have our fun out ."
"If you are afraid , I 'll slow down and you can jump off , '' and his brown eyes sparkled with the double delight of getting his heart 's desire and astonishing his friend at the same time by his skill and coolness ."
`` Go ahead .
"I 'll jump when you do ; '' and Gus calmly sat down again , bound in honor to stand by his mate till the smash came , though rather dismayed at the audacity of the prank ."
`` Do n't you call this just splendid ? ''
"exclaimed Frank , as they rolled along over the crossing , past the bridge , toward the curve , a mile from the station ."
`` Not bad .
They are yelling like mad after us .
"Better go back , if you can , '' said Gus , who was anxiously peering out , and , in spite of his efforts to seem at ease , not enjoying the trip a particle ."
`` Let them yell .
"I started to go to the curve , and I 'll do it if it costs me a hundred dollars ."
"No danger ; there 's no train under twenty minutes , I tell you , '' and Frank pulled out his watch ."
"But the sun was in his eyes , and he did not see clearly , or he would have discovered that it was later than he thought ."
"On they went , and were just rounding the bend when a shrill whistle in front startled both boys , and drove the color out of their cheeks ."
`` It 's the factory train ! ''
"cried Gus , in a husky tone , as he sprang to his feet ."
"`` No ; it 's the five-forty on the other road , '' answered Frank , with a queer thrill all through him at the thought of what might happen if it was not ."
"Both looked straight ahead as the last tree glided by , and the long track lay before them , with the freight train slowly coming down ."
"For an instant , the boys stood as if paralyzed ."
`` Jump ! ''
"said Gus , looking at the steep bank on one side and the river on the other , undecided which to try ."
`` Sit still ! ''
"commanded Frank , collecting his wits , as he gave a warning whistle to retard the on-coming train , while he reversed the engine and went back faster than he came ."
"A crowd of angry men was waiting for them , and Bill stood at the open switch in a towering passion as No. 11 returned to her place unharmed , but bearing two pale and frightened boys , who stepped slowly and silently down , without a word to say for themselves , while the freight train rumbled by on the main track ."
"Frank and Gus never had a very clear idea as to what occurred during the next few minutes , but vaguely remembered being well shaken , sworn at , questioned , threatened with direful penalties , and finally ordered off the premises forever by the wrathful depot-master ."
"Joe was nowhere to be seen , and as the two culprits walked away , trying to go steadily , while their heads spun round , and all the strength seemed to have departed from their legs , Frank said , in an exhausted tone , -- `` Come down to the boat-house and rest a minute . ''"
A ` phone message has just come through from Charlottetown that Woodrow Wilson has sent that German ambassador man to the right about at last .
They tell me that means war .
"So I begin to think that Woodrow 's heart is in the right place after all , wherever his head may be , and I am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion with some fudge , despite the howls of the Food Board ."
I thought that submarine business would bring things to a crisis .
I told Cousin Sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the end for the Allies . ''
"`` Do n't let the doctor hear of the fudge , Susan , '' said Anne , with a smile ."
`` You know he has laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for . ''
"`` Yes , Mrs. Dr. dear , and a man should be master in his own household , and his women folk should bow to his decrees ."
I flatter myself that I am becoming quite efficient in economizing '' -- Susan had taken to using certain German terms with killing effect -- `` but one can exercise a little gumption on the quiet now and then .
"Shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other day -- the Susan brand , as he called it -- and I said ` The first victory there is to celebrate I shall make you some . '"
"I consider this news quite equal to a victory , and what the doctor does not know will never grieve him ."
"I take the whole responsibility , Mrs. Dr. dear , so do not you vex your conscience . ''"
Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter .
"He came home from Queen 's every week-end , and Susan had all his favourite dishes for him , in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor , and waited on him hand and foot ."
"Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him , but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse ; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued , Susan 's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed ."
Surely the end was in sight -- would come now before -- anyone else -- could go .
`` Things are coming our way at last .
"We have got the Germans on the run , '' she boasted ."
"`` The United States has declared war at last , as I always believed they would , in spite of Woodrow 's gift for letter writing , and you will see they will go into it with a vim since I understand that is their habit , when they do start ."
"And we have got the Germans on the run , too . ''"
"`` The States mean well , '' moaned Cousin Sophia , `` but all the vim in the world can not put them on the fighting line this spring , and the Allies will be finished before that ."
The Germans are just luring them on .
That man Simonds says their retreat has put the Allies in a hole . ''
"`` That man Simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good , '' retorted Susan ."
`` I do not worry myself about his opinion as long as Lloyd George is Premier of England .
He will not be bamboozled and that you may tie to .
Things look good to me .
"The U. S. is in the war , and we have got Kut and Bagdad back -- and I would not be surprised to see the Allies in Berlin by June -- and the Russians , too , since they have got rid of the Czar ."
"That , in my opinion was a good piece of work . ''"
"`` Time will show if it is , '' said Cousin Sophia , who would have been very indignant if anyone had told her that she would rather see Susan put to shame as a seer , than a successful overthrow of tyranny , or even the march of the Allies down Unter den Linden ."
"But then the woes of the Russian people were quite unknown to Cousin Sophia , while this aggravating , optimistic Susan was an ever-present thorn in her side ."
"Just at that moment Shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the living-room , swinging his legs -- a brown , ruddy , wholesome lad , from top to toe , every inch of him -- and saying coolly , `` Mother and dad , I was eighteen last Monday ."
"cried he , as soon as he could speak ."
` Is the prince dead ? '
"faltered Muffette , growing white and cold ."
"` No , no ; but -- oh , how can I tell you ! '"
And he sank down on a pile of cushions while his wife and daughter knelt beside him .
"At length he was able to tell his tale , and a terrible one it was !"
"There had just arrived at court a huge giant , as ambassador from the dragon by whose help the king had rescued the queen and Muffette from the crystal palace ."
"The dragon had been very busy for many years past , and had quite forgotten the princess till the news of her betrothal reached his ears ."
Then he remembered the bargain he had made with her father ; and the more he heard of Muffette the more he felt sure she would make a delicious dish .
So he had ordered the giant who was his servant to fetch her at once .
No words would paint the horror of both the queen and the princess as they listened to this dreadful doom .
"They rushed instantly to the hall , where the giant was awaiting them , and flinging themselves at his feet implored him to take the kingdom if he would , but to have pity on the princess ."
"The giant looked at them kindly , for he was not at all hard-hearted , but said that he had no power to do anything , and that if the princess did not go with him quietly the dragon would come himself ."
"Several days went by , and the king and queen hardly ceased from entreating the aid of the giant , who by this time was getting weary of waiting ."
"` There is only one way of helping you , ' he said at last , ` and that is to marry the princess to my nephew , who , besides being young and handsome , has been trained in magic , and will know how to keep her safe from the dragon . '"
"` Oh , thank you , thank you ! '"
"cried the parents , clasping his great hands to their breasts ."
` You have indeed lifted a load from us .
She shall have half the kingdom for her dowry . '
But Muffette stood up and thrust them aside . '
"I will not buy my life with faithlessness , ' she said proudly ; ` and I will go with you this moment to the dragon 's abode . '"
And all her father 's and mother 's tears and prayers availed nothing to move her .
"The next morning Muffette was put into a litter , and , guarded by the giant and followed by the king and queen and the weeping maids of honour , they started for the foot of the mountain where the dragon had his castle ."
"The way , though rough and stony , seemed all too short , and when they reached the spot appointed by the dragon the giant ordered the men who bore the litter to stand still ."
"` It is time for you to bid farewell to your daughter , ' said he ; ` for I see the dragon coming to us . '"
"It was true ; a cloud appeared to pass over the sun , for between them and it they could all discern dimly a huge body half a mile long approaching nearer and nearer ."
"At first the king could not believe that this was the small beast who had seemed so friendly on the shore of the lake of quicksilver but then he knew very little of necromancy , and had never studied the art of expanding and contracting his body ."
"But it was the dragon and nothing else , whose six wings were carrying him forward as fast as might be , considering his great weight and the length of his tail , which had fifty twists and a half ."
"He came quickly , yes ; but the frog , mounted on a greyhound , and wearing her cap on her head , went quicker still ."
"Entering a room where the prince was sitting gazing at the portrait of his betrothed , she cried to him : ` What are you doing lingering here , when the life of the princess is nearing its last moment ?"
"In the courtyard you will find a green horse with three heads and twelve feet , and by its side a sword eighteen yards long ."
"Hasten , lest you should be too late ! '"
"Dan felt they did not quite trust him , and never showed them his best side , but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting their hopes as far as he dared ."
"Mr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting , and did not think it a proof of either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for the amusement of the rest ."
"All sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged , and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining ; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play ."
"Dan laughed at this rule , and told such exciting tales of his own valor , and the many frays that he had been in , that some of the lads were fired with a desire to have a regular good `` mill . ''"
"`` Do n't tell , and I 'll show you how , '' said Dan ; and , getting half a dozen of the lads together behind the barn , he gave them a lesson in boxing , which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them ."
"Emil , however , could not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself , for Emil was past fourteen and a plucky fellow , so he challenged Dan to a fight ."
"Dan accepted at once , and the others looked on with intense interest ."
"What little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew , but , in the very hottest of the fray , when Dan and Emil were fighting like a pair of young bulldogs , and the others with fierce , excited faces were cheering them on , Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring , plucked the combatants apart with a strong hand , and said , in the voice they seldom heard , `` I ca n't allow this , boys !"
Stop it at once ; and never let me see it again .
"I keep a school for boys , not for wild beasts ."
Look at each other and be ashamed of yourselves . ''
"`` You let me go , and I 'll knock him down again , '' shouted Dan , sparring away in spite of the grip on his collar ."
"`` Come on , come on , I ai n't thrashed yet ! ''"
"cried Emil , who had been down five times , but did not know when he was beaten ."
"`` They are playing be gladdy what-you-call - 'em s , like the Romans , Uncle Fritz , '' called out Demi , whose eyes were bigger than ever with the excitement of this new pastime ."
"`` They were a fine set of brutes ; but we have learned something since then , I hope , and I can not have you make my barn a Colosseum ."
Who proposed this ? ''
asked Mr. Bhaer .
"`` Dan , '' answered several voices ."
`` Do n't you know that it is forbidden ? ''
"`` Yes , '' growled Dan , sullenly ."
`` Then why break the rule ? ''
"`` They 'll all be molly-coddles , if they do n't know how to fight . ''"
`` Have you found Emil a molly-coddle ?
"He does n't look much like one , '' and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face ."
"Dan had a black eye , and his jacket was torn to rags , but Emil 's face was covered with blood from a cut lip and a bruised nose , while a bump on his forehead was already as purple as a plum ."
"In spite of his wounds however , he still glared upon his foe , and evidently panted to renew the fight ."
"`` He 'd make a first-rater if he was taught , '' said Dan , unable to withhold the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best ."
"`` He 'll be taught to fence and box by and by , and till then I think he will do very well without any lessons in mauling ."
"Go and wash your faces ; and remember , Dan , if you break any more of the rules again , you will be sent away ."
That was the bargain ; do your part and we will do ours . ''
"The lads went off , and after a few more words to the spectators , Mr. Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators ."
"The forts, now threatened in the rear by Butler's army, surrendered, and Farragut went up to Baton Rouge and took possession of it. General Butler's occupation at New Orleans has been variously commented upon by both friend and foe, but we are only able to learn from this and the entire record of the war, in fact, that it is better to avoid hostilities unless one is ready to accept the unpleasant features of combat. The author, when a boy, learned this after he had acquired the unpleasant features resulting from combat which the artist has cleverly shown on opposite page."
"General Butler said he found it almost impossible to avoid giving offence to the foe, and finally he gave it up in despair."
"The French are said to be the politest people on the face of the earth, but no German will admit it; and though the Germans are known to have big, warm, hospitable hearts, since the Franco-Prussian war you couldn't get a Frenchman to admit this."
"In February Burnside captured Roanoke Island, and the coast of North Carolina fell into the hands of the Union army. Port Royal became the base of operations against Florida, and at the close of the year 1862 every city on the Atlantic coast except Charleston, Wilmington, and Savannah was held by the Union army."
"The Merrimac iron-clad, which had made much trouble for the Union shipping for some time, steamed into Hampton Roads on the 8th of March."
"Hampton Roads is not the Champs-Elysées of the South, but a long wet stretch of track east of Virginia, the Midway Plaisance of the Salted Sea. The Merrimac steered for the Cumberland, rammed her, and the Cumberland sunk like a stove-lid, with all on board. The captain of the Congress, warned by the fate of the Cumberland, ran his vessel on shore and tried to conceal her behind the tall grass, but the Merrimac followed and shelled her till she surrendered."
"The Merrimac then went back to Norfolk, where she boarded, night having come on apace. In the morning she aimed to clear out the balance of the Union fleet. That night, however, the Monitor, a flat little craft with a revolving tower, invented by Captain Ericsson, arrived, and in the morning when the Merrimac started in on her day's work of devastation, beginning with the Minnesota, the insignificant-looking Monitor slid up to the iron monster and gave her two one-hundred-and-sixty-six-and-three-quarter-pound solid shot."
"The Merrimac replied with a style of broadside that generally sunk her adversary, but the balls rolled off the low flat deck and fell with a solemn plunk in the moaning sea, or broke in fragments and lay on the forward deck like the shells of antique eggs on the floor of the House of Parliament after a Home Rule argument."
"Five times the Merrimac tried to ram the little spitz-pup of the navy, but her huge iron beak rode up over the slippery deck of the enemy, and when the big vessel looked over her sides to see its wreck, she discovered that the Monitor was right side up and ready for more."
"The Confederate vessel gave it up at last, and went back to Norfolk defeated, her career suddenly closed by the timely genius of the able Scandinavian."
"The Peninsular campaign was principally addressed toward the capture of Richmond. One hundred thousand men were massed at Fort Monroe April 4, and marched slowly toward Yorktown, where five thousand Confederates under General Magruder stopped the great army under McClellan."
"After a month's siege, and just as McClellan was about to shoot at the town, the garrison took its valise and went away."
"On the 5th of May occurred the battle of Williamsburg, between the forces under ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker and General Johnston. It lasted nine hours, and ended in the routing of the Confederates and their pursuit by Hooker to within seven miles of Richmond. This caused the adjournment of the Confederate Congress."
"But Johnston prevented the junction of McDowell and McClellan after the capture of Hanover Court-House, and Stonewall Jackson, reinforced by Ewell, scared the Union forces almost to death. They crossed the Potomac, having marched thirty-five miles per day. Washington was getting too hot now to hold people who could get away."
It was hard to say which capital had been scared the worst.
"The Governors of the Northern States were asked to send militia to defend the capital, and the front door of the White House was locked every night after ten o'clock."
"But finally the Union generals, instead of calling for more troops, got after General Jackson, and he fled from the Shenandoah Valley, burning the bridges behind him. It is said that as he and his staff were about to cross their last bridge they saw a mounted gun on the opposite side, manned by a Union artilleryman. Jackson rode up and in clarion tones called out, ""Who told you to put that gun there, sir? Bring it over here, sir, and mount it, and report at head-quarters this evening, sir!"""
"The artilleryman unlimbered the gun, and while he was placing it General Jackson and staff crossed over and joined the army."
"One cannot be too careful, during a war, in the matter of obedience to orders. We should always know as nearly as possible whether our orders come from the proper authority or not."
"No one can help admiring this dashing officer's tour in the Shenandoah Valley, where he kept three major-generals and sixty thousand troops awake nights with fifteen thousand men, saved Richmond, scared Washington into fits, and prevented the union of McClellan's and McDowell's forces. Had there been more such men, and a little more confidence in the great volume of typographical errors called Confederate money, the lovely character who pens these lines might have had a different tale to tell."
"May 31 and June 1 occurred the battle of Fair Oaks, where McClellan's men floundering in the mud of the Chickahominy swamps were pounced upon by General Johnston, who was wounded the first day. On the following day, as a result of this accident, Johnston's men were repulsed in disorder."
"General Robert E. Lee, who was now in command of the Confederate forces, desired to make his army even more offensive than it had been, and on June 12 General Stuart led off with his cavalry, made the entire circuit of the Union army, saw how it looked from behind, and returned to Richmond, much improved in health, having had several meals of victuals while absent."
"Hooker now marched to where he could see the dome of the court-house at Richmond, but just then McClellan heard that Jackson had been seen in the neighborhood of Hanover Court-House, and so decided to change his base. General McClellan was a man of great refinement, and would never use the same base over a week at a time."
"He had hardly got the base changed when Lee fell upon his flank at Mechanicsville, June 26, and the Seven Days' battle followed. The Union troops fought and fell back, fought and fell back, until Malvern Hill was reached, where, worn with marching, choked with dust, and broken down by the heat, to which they were unaccustomed, they made their last stand, July 1. Here Lee got such a reception that he did not insist on going any farther."
"But the Union army was cooped up on the James River. The siege of Richmond had been abandoned, and the North felt blue and discouraged."
"Three hundred thousand more men were called for, and it seemed that, as in the South, ""the cradle and the grave were to be robbed"" for more troops."
"Lee now decided to take Washington and butcher Congress to make a Roman holiday. General Pope met the Confederates August 26, and while Lee and Jackson were separated could have whipped the latter had the Army of the Potomac reinforced him as it should, but, full of malaria and foot-sore with marching, it did not reach him in time, and Pope had to fight the entire Confederate army on that historic ground covered with so many unpleasant memories and other things, called Bull Run."
"For the second time the worn and wilted Union army was glad to get back to Washington, where the President was, and where beer was only five cents per glass."
"Oh, how sad everything seemed at that time to the North, and how high cotton cloth was! The bride who hastily married her dear one and bade him good-by as the bugle called him to the war, pointed with pride to her cotton clothes as a mark of wealth; and the middle classes were only too glad to have a little cotton mixed with their woollen clothes."
"Lee invaded Maryland, and McClellan, restored to command of the Army of the Potomac, followed him, and found a copy of his order of march, which revealed the fact that only a portion of the army was before him. So, overtaking the Confederates at South Mountain, he was ready for a victory, but waited one day; and in the mountains Lee got his troops united again, while Jackson also returned. The Union troops had over eighty thousand in their ranks, and nothing could have been more thoughtful or genteel than to wait for the Confederates to get as many together as possible, otherwise the battle might have been brief and unsatisfactory to the tax-payer or newspaper subscriber, who of course wants his money's worth when he pays for a battle."
"Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on the dragon's head and said: ""Can I be of any assistance?"""
"Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say nothing else. So the white grouse said: ""One moment. I am only too grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct about the firework!"""
"And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and only their faces peeped out."
"""Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,"" said Jane, ""but you'll be cold yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear feathers?"""
"The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind, soft bird voices."
"""Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts warm!"""
"Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners."
"So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk."
"The dragon had not moved yet but then he might at any moment get warm enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:"
"""You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you."
"What more can you possibly want?"""
"Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: ""Oh, do mind your wings in the fires!"""
For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.
"""What's the matter?"" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail."
So they told him.
"""Sealskin, are they?"" said the moth. ""Just you wait a minute!"""
"He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and the stars."
And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.
"For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls, and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the sealskin fur."
"Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children who eat fur but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When they are not thinking about you they say, ""I fear the moths have got at my ermine tippet,"" or, ""Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak, but it was eaten by moths."" And now there were more moths than have ever been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs."
"The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the very life and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat bare pelts."
"""Oh, thank you thank you, darling Arctic moth,"" cried Jane. ""You are good I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you afterward!"""
"Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings, ""We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves once in a while to oblige a friend."""
"And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!"
"""Oh, dear,"" said Jane, ""this is the worst of all!"""
"""We've no friends left to help us,"" said George. He never thought that the dragon himself might help them but then that was an idea that would never have occurred to any boy."
"It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers the children shivered."
"Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy length over the snow, and said: ""This is something like! How faint those fires did make me feel!"""
"The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die."
"But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and Jane, because they were frozen to his back."
"He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling south with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a million ways of going south from the North Pole so you will own that it was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed, between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace."
"and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered, “I am fishing.” The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said, “It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.” The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own."
"They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen."
"When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, “Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant’s hut.” One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, “Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,” and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, “Good God! where am I?” He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, “My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.” Tears rose to the King’s eyes and he said, “Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,” and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living."
95 Old Hildebrand
"Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, “Listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. I’ll tell you what; on Wednesday, you must take to your bed, and tell your husband you are ill, and if you only complain and act being ill properly, and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be, and makes a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where you can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother, the sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored to health immediately.”"
"“I will manage it,” said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said, “I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before my end I should like to hear the parson’s sermon that he is going to preach to-day.” On that the peasant said, “Ah, my child, do not do it—thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look, I will go to the sermon, and will attend to it very carefully, and will tell thee everything the parson says.”"
"“Well,” said the woman, “go, then, and pay great attention, and repeat to me all that thou hearest.” So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer."
"Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried, “Hurrah! dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well! The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster,” and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly."
"But now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs. “May you be blessed,” said the gossip, “where are you off to so fast?”"
"“To all eternity, my friend,” said the peasant, “my wife is ill, and I have been to-day to hear the parson’s sermon, and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and made a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother, the sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my pilgrimage.” “But listen, gossip,” said the egg-merchant to the peasant, “are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing as that? Don’t you know what it means? The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.”"
“My word!” said the peasant. “How I’d like to know if that’s true!”
"“Come, then,” said the gossip, “I’ll tell you what to do. Get into my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will see for yourself.” So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home."
"When they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there. “It is I, gossip,” said the egg-merchant, “give me shelter this night; I have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it, for it is dark already.”"
"“Indeed, my friend,” said the woman, “thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me, but as thou art here it can’t be helped, come in, and take a seat there on the bench by the stove.” Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said, “Listen, my dear friend, thou canst sing beautifully; sing something to me.” “Oh,” said the woman, “I cannot sing now, in my young days indeed I could sing well enough, but that’s all over now.”"
"“Come,” said the parson once more, “do sing some little song.”"
"On that the woman began and sang,"
“I’ve sent my husband away from me To the Göckerli hill in Italy.”
"Thereupon the parson sang,"
"“I wish ’twas a year before he came back, I’d never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.”"
Hallelujah.
"Then the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,"
"“What art thou doing, my Hildebrand dear, There on the bench by the stove so near?”"
Hallelujah.
"And then the peasant sang from his basket,"
"“All singing I ever shall hate from this day, And here in this basket no longer I’ll stay.”"
Hallelujah.
"And he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house."
96 The Three Little Birds
"About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, “If I do not get that one, I will have none.” Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King’s right hand, “Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.”"
"These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said, “Yes,” and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax."
"But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"Heretofore among the politicians a platform, like that on the railway cars, ""is made for the purpose of helping the party to get aboard, but not to ride on."""
"The Columbian Exposition and World's Fair at Chicago in the summer of 1893 eclipsed all former Exhibitions, costing more and showing greater artistic taste, especially in its buildings, than anything preceding it."
"Some gentle warfare resulted from a struggle over the question of opening the ""White City"" on Sunday, and a great deal of bitterness was shown by those who opposed the opening and who had for years favored the Sunday closing of Niagara. A doubtful victory was obtained by the Sunday openers, for so many of the exhibitors closed their departments that visitors did not attend on Sunday in paying quantities."
"Against a thousand odds and over a thousand obstacles, especially the apprehension of Asiatic cholera and the actual sudden appearance of a gigantic money panic, Chicago, heroic and victorious, carried out her mighty plans and gave to the world an exhibition that won golden opinions from her friends and stilled in dumb wonder the jealousy of her enemies."
"In the mean time, the author begs leave to thank his readers for the rapt attention shown in perusing these earnest pages, and to apologize for the tears of sympathy thoughtlessly wrung from eyes unused to weep, by the graphic word-painting and fine education shown by the author."
"It was not the intention of the writer to touch the fountain of tears and create wash-outs everywhere, but sometimes tears do one good."
"In closing, would it be out of place to say that the stringency of the money market is most noticeable and most painful, and for that reason would it be too much trouble for the owner of this book to refuse to loan it, thereby encouraging its sale and contributing to the comfort of a deserving young man?"
THE END.
THE Velveteen Rabbit
"Here was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming."
"There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten."
Christmas Morning
"For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse."
The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.
"He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it."
"""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"""
"""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."""
"""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit."
"""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."""
"""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?"""
"""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept."
"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
"""I suppose you are real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled."
The Skin Horse Tells His Story
"""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said. ""That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always."""
"The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him."
"There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards. She called this ""tidying up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft."
"One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop."
"""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!"""
"The Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful. Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one’s head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it. But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat."
"Then the King said to her, “My child, and where hast thou learnt that?”"
"“Yes,” she said, “I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?” “Oh, yes,” said he. But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed. Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful."
"He, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it. And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a King’s son."
127 The Iron Stove
"In the days when wishing was still of some use, a King’s son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest."
"There he passed many years, and no one could deliver him. Then a King’s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father’s kingdom again. After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove. Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, “Whence comest thou, and whither goest, thou?” She answered, “I have lost my father’s kingdom, and cannot get home again.”"
"Then a voice inside the iron stove said, “I will help thee to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if thou wilt promise to do what I desire of thee. I am the son of a far greater King than thy father, and I will marry thee.”"
"Then was she afraid, and thought, “Good heavens! What can I do with an iron stove?” But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired. But he said, “Thou shalt return here, and bring a knife with thee, and scrape a hole in the iron.” Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, but in two hours he took her home; there was great joy in the castle when the King’s daughter came home, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, “Dear father, what I have suffered! I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.”"
"Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter. They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller’s daughter, who was very beautiful. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove."
"So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it. When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, “It seems to me it is day outside.” Then she answered, “It seems so to me too; I fancy I hear the noise of my father’s mill.”"
"“So thou art a miller’s daughter! Then go thy way at once, and let the King’s daughter come here.” Then she went away at once, and told the old King that the man outside there, would have none of her he wanted the King’s daughter. They, however, still had a swine-herd’s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller’s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the King’s daughter. So she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours. She, however, made nothing of it. When day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, “It seems to me it is day outside!” Then answered she, “So it seems to me also; I fancy I hear my father’s horn blowing.”"
"“Then thou art a swine-herd’s daughter! Go away at once, and tell the King’s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised, and if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.” When the King’s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise. So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove in the forest."
"When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a small hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted. Now, therefore, she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to get out. Then said he, “Thou art mine, and I am thine; thou art my bride, and hast released me.” He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her father, and the King’s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words, and then she was to come back again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains and piercing swords; but the King’s son was set free, and no longer shut up in it. After this she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be found. For nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for she could no longer live. When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts. When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and thought, “Ah, there I should be saved!” She got down from the tree, and went towards the light, but on the way she prayed. Then she came to a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small heap of wood lay in front of it."
"She thought, “Ah, whither have I come,” and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing inside but toads, big and little, except a table well covered with wine and roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver. Then she took courage, and knocked at the door. The fat toad cried,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And quickly see who is without:”"
"and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down."
"They asked, “Where hast thou come from, and whither art thou going?”"
"Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had transgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than three words, the stove, and the King’s son also, had disappeared, and now she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him."
"Then the old fat one said,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And bring me the great box.”"
"Then the little one went and brought the box. After this they gave her meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God’s name, and slept."
"When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three needles out of the great box which she was to take with her; they would be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, and go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all this she would get her lover back again. Then she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. With these she travelled onwards, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully. After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them."
"At last she arrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a large and beautiful castle. She went and asked for a place; she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired. She knew, however, that the King’s son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle. Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages. But, already the King’s son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead."
"In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when lo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it! But when the bride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it, and said, “It is not a dress for a servant-girl.” But she said no, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night in her bridegroom’s chamber. The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, “That silly girl will sleep in thy room.”"
"“If thou art willing so am I,” said he. She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him."
"She wept the whole night and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!”"
"The servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord. And the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride beheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom’s chamber. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing. But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!” The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it. And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold. When the bride saw that she wanted to have it, but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegroom’s apartment. The King’s son was, however, on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away. Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, “Dearest love, I set thee free when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest,” the King’s son leapt up and said, “Thou art the true one, thou art mine, and I am thine.” Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took away the false bride’s clothes so that she could not get up. When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass mountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they got to the little old house; but when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were King’s children, and full of happiness. Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King’s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their fathers. As, however, the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him to live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy wedlock."
"A mouse did run, This story is done."
128 The Lazy Spinner
"In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so idle that she would never work at anything; whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap. If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, “Well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel? Just you go into the forest and get me one.” “If that is all,” said the man, “then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels.” Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again. She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,"
"“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"""Quite,"" said the Princess. ""I only wish I were half as sure that he wouldn't hurt you."""
"""My Princess,"" he said tenderly, ""two great powers are on our side: the power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than anything else in the world."""
"So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and he gave a cry of rage and it was like twenty engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station."
"And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any number of them far too many so that it looked like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as bayonets."
"""Good-bye, love!"" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward the sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm."
"The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet and the very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam."
"Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer, and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to know when to pull the rope."
"On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the tide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge."
"Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy it turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life and the tide began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island."
"But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him."
"""Now, there's only the griffin,"" said Nigel. And the Princess said:"
"""Yes only "" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial and next day she said to Nigel: ""You know a griffin is half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea."""
So they talked it over and arranged everything.
"When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the Princess cried: ""Look out! There's a lion behind you."""
"And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished, exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats."
"""Poor griffin,"" said the Princess, ""it was very good at the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered."""
"At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long."
"When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as many times as was good for them, the witch said: ""Well, but what about the whirlpools?"""
"And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: ""I'm not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide."""
"So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as smooth as glass."
"The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some good after all."
"When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as long as was good for them."
"The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady from her lover."
"I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do."
THE DRAGON TAMERS]
VI. The Dragon Tamers
"There was once an old, old castle it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where."
"Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs."
"John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole."
"And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat."
"Troubles arose in 1878 over the right to fish in the northeast waters, and the treaty at Washington resulted in an award to Great Britain of five million five hundred thousand dollars, with the understanding that wasteful fishing should cease, and that as soon as either party got enough for a mess he should go home, no matter how well the fish seemed to be biting."
"The right to regulate Chinese immigration was given by treaty at Pekin, and ever since the Chinaman has entered our enclosures in some mysterious way, made enough in a few years to live like a potentate in China, and returned, leaving behind a pleasant memory and a chiffonnier here and there throughout the country filled with scorched shirt-bosoms, acid-eaten collars, and white vests with burglar-proof, ingrowing pockets in them."
The next nominations for President and Vice-President were James A.
"Garfield, of Ohio, and Chester A. Arthur, of New York, on the Republican ticket, and Winfield S. Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and William H."
"English, of Indiana, on the Democratic ticket. James B. Weaver was connected with this campaign also. Who will tell us what he had to do with it? Can no one tell us what James B. Weaver had to do with the campaign of 1881? Very well; I will tell you what he had to do with the campaign of 1881."
"He was the Presidential candidate on the Greenback ticket, but it was kept so quiet that I am not surprised to know that you did not hear about it."
"After the inauguration of Garfield the investigation and annulling of star-route contracts fraudulently obtained were carried out, whereby two million dollars' worth of these corrupt agreements were rendered null and void."
"On the morning of July 2, President Garfield was shot by a poor, miserable, unbalanced, and abnormal growth whose name will not be discovered even in the appendix of this work. He was tried, convicted, and sent squealing into eternity."
"The President lingered patiently for two months and a half, when he died."
"After the accession of President Arthur, there occurred floods on the lower Mississippi, whereby one hundred thousand people lost their homes."
The administration was not in any way to blame for this.
"In 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge across East River was completed and ready for jumping purposes. It was regarded as a great engineering success at the time, but it is now admitted that it is not high enough. A person jumping from it is not always killed."
"The same year the Civil Service Bill became a law. It provides that competitive examinations shall be made of certain applicants for office, whereby mail-carriers must prove that they know how to teach school, and guards in United States penitentiaries are required to describe how to navigate a ship."
"Possibly recent improvements have been made by which the curriculum is more fitted to the crime, but in the early operations of the law the janitor of a jail had to know what length shadow would be cast by a pole 18 feet 6-1/4 inches high on the third day of July at 11 o'clock 30 min."
"and 20 sec. standing on a knoll 35 feet 8-1/8 inches high, provided 8 men in 9 days can erect such a pole working 8 hours per day."
"In 1883 letter postage was reduced from three cents to two cents per half-ounce, and in 1885 to two cents per ounce."
"In 1884 Alaska was organized as a Territory, and after digging the snow out of Sitka, so that the governor should not take cold in his system, it was made the seat of government."
"Chinese immigration in 1882 was forbidden for ten years, and in 1884 a treaty with Mexico was made, a copy of which is on file in the State Department, but not allowed to be loaned to the author for use in this work."
"Grover Cleveland and Thomas A. Hendricks were nominated and elected at the end of President Arthur's term, running against James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, the Republican candidates, also Benjamin F. Butler and A."
"M. West, of Mississippi, on the People's ticket, and John P. St. John and William Daniel on the Prohibition ticket. St. John went home and kept bees, so that he could have honey to eat on his Kansas locusts, and Daniel swore he would never enter the performing cage of immoral political wild beasts again while reason remained on her throne."
"In 1886 a Presidential succession law was passed, whereby on the death of the President and the Vice-President the order of succession shall be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Attorney-General, the Postmaster-General, and the Secretaries of the Navy and of the Interior. This gives the Secretary of Agriculture an extremely remote and rarefied chance at the Presidency. Still, he should be just as faithful to his trust as he would be if he were nearer the throne."
"May 4, 1886, occurred a terrible outbreak of Chicago Anarchists, whereby seven policemen sent to preserve order were killed by the bursting of an Anarchist's bomb. The Anarchists were tried and executed, with the exception of Ling, who ate a dynamite capsule and passed into rest having had his features, and especially his nose, blown in a swift and earnest manner. Death resulted, and whiskers and beer-blossoms are still found embedded in the stone walls of his cell. Those who attended the funeral say that Ling from a scenic point of view was not a success."
"Governor Altgeld, of Illinois, an amateur American, in the summer of 1893 pardoned two of the Anarchists who had escaped death by imprisonment."
"August 31, 1886, in Charleston, occurred several terrible earthquake shocks, which seriously damaged the city and shocked and impaired the nerves and health of hundreds of people."
The noted heroism and pluck of the people of Charleston were never shown to greater advantage than on this occasion.
"Mr. Cleveland was again nominated, but was defeated by General Benjamin Harrison. Hon. James G. Blaine, of Maine, was made Secretary of State, and Wm. Windom, a veteran financier, Secretary of the Treasury."
"Secretary Windom's tragic death just as he had finished a most brilliant address to the great capitalists of New York after their annual dinner and discussion at Delmonico's is, and will ever remain, while life lasts, a most dramatic picture in the author's memory."
"Personally, the administration of President Harrison will be long remembered for the number of deaths among the families of the Executive and those of his Cabinet and friends."
"Nebraska, the thirty-seventh State, was admitted March 1, 1867. The name signifies ""Water Valley."" Colorado, the Centennial State, was the thirty-eighth. She was admitted July 1, 1876. Six other States have been since admitted when the political sign was right. Still, they have not always stuck by the party admitting them to the Union. This is the kind of ingratitude which sometimes leads to the reformation of politicians supposed to have been dead in sin."
"President Harrison's administration was a thoroughly upright and honest one, so far as it was possible for it to be after his party had drifted into the musty catacombs of security in office and the ship of state had become covered with large and expensive barnacles."
"As we go to press, his successor, Grover Cleveland, in the first year of his second administration, is paying a high price for fleeting fame, with the serious question of what to do with the relative coinage of gold and silver, and the Democrats in Congress, for the first time in the history of the world, are referring each other with hot breath and flashing eye to the platform they adopted at the National Convention."
150 The Old Beggar-Woman
"There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now? This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, “May God reward you.” The beggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself. The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, “Come, old mother, and warm yourself.” She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it. The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out. Is it not true that he ought to have put them out? And if he had not any water, then should he have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them."
151 The Three Sluggards
"A certain King had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death. When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, “Dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you; whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.” The eldest said, “Then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep.” The second said; “Father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg.” The third said, “Father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.” When the father heard that, he said, “Thou hast carried it the farthest, and shalt be King.”"
151* The Twelve Idle Servants
"Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either, but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness. The first said, “What is your laziness to me, I have to concern myself about mine own? The care of my body is my principal work, I eat not a little and drink still more. When I have had four meals, I fast a short time until I feel hunger again, and that suits me best. To rise betimes is not for me; when it is getting near mid-day, I already seek out a resting-place for myself. If the master call, I do exactly as if I had not heard him, and if he call for the second time, I wait awhile before I get up, and go to him very slowly."
In this way life is endurable.”
"The second said, “I have a horse to look after, but I leave the bit in his mouth, and if I do not want to do it, I give him no food, and I say he has had it already. I, however, lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours. After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse’s body, and then he is combed and cleaned. Who is going to make a great business of that? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me.”"
"The third said, “Why plague oneself with work? Nothing comes of it! I laid myself in the sun, and fell asleep. It began to rain a little, but why should I get up? I let it rain on in God’s name. At last came a splashing shower, so heavy indeed, that it pulled the hair out of my head and washed it away, and I got a hole in the skull; I put a plaster on it, and then it was all right. I have already had several injuries of that kind.”"
"The fourth said, “If I am to undertake a piece of work, I first loiter about for an hour that I may save up my strength. After that I begin quite slowly, and ask if no one is there who could help me. Then I let him do the chief of the work, and in reality only look on; but that also is still too much for me.”"
"The fifth said, “What does that matter? Just think, I am to take away the manure from the horse’s stable, and load the cart with it. I let it go on slowly, and if I have taken anything on the fork, I only half-raise it up, and then I rest just a quarter of an hour until I quite throw it in. It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day. I have no fancy for killing myself with work.”"
"The sixth said, “Shame on ye; I am afraid of no work, but I lie down for three weeks, and never once take my clothes off. What is the use of buckling your shoes on? For aught I care they may fall off my feet, it is no matter. If I am going up some steps, I drag one foot slowly after the other on to the first step, and then I count the rest of them that I may know where I must rest.”"
"The seventh said, “That will not do with me; my master looks after my work, only he is not at home the whole day. But I neglect nothing, I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls. If I am to get on, four sturdy men must push me with all their might. I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other. I lay down by them and slept too. There was no wakening me again, and when they wanted to have me home, they had to carry me.” The eighth said, “I see plainly that I am the only active fellow; if a stone lie before me, I do not give myself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it. I lay myself down on the ground, and if I am wet and covered with mud and dirt, I stay lying until the sun has dried me again. At the very most, I only turn myself so that it can shine on me.” The ninth said, “That is the right way! To-day the bread was before me, but I was too idle to take it, and nearly died of hunger! Moreover a jug stood by it, but it was so big and heavy that I did not like to lift it up, and preferred bearing thirst. Just to turn myself round was too much for me, I remained lying like a log the whole day.” The tenth said, “Laziness has brought misfortune on me, a broken leg and swollen calf. Three of us were lying in the road, and I had my legs stretched out. Some one came with a cart, and the wheels went over me. I might indeed have drawn my legs back, but I did not hear the cart coming, for the midges were humming about my ears, and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth; who can take the trouble to drive the vermin away?”"
"The eleventh said, “I gave up my place yesterday. I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again. There was no end of it all day long. But to tell the truth, he gave me my dismissal, and would not keep me any longer, for his clothes, which I had left lying in the dust, were all moth-eaten, and I am very glad of it.”"
"The twelfth said, “To-day I had to drive the cart into the country, and made myself a bed of straw on it, and had a good sleep. The reins slipped out of my hand, and when I awoke, the horse had nearly torn itself loose, the harness was gone, the strap which fastened the horse to the shafts was gone, and so were the collar, the bridle and bit."
"Some one had come by, who had carried all off. Besides this, the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast. I left it standing, and stretched myself on the straw again. At last the master came himself, and pushed the cart out, and if he had not come I should not be lying here but there, and sleeping in full tranquillity.”"
152 The Shepherd Boy
"There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him, “If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shalt dwell with me in my royal palace.” The boy said, “What are the three questions?” The King said, “The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?” The shepherd boy answered, “Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.” The King said, “The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?” The shepherd boy said, “Give me a great sheet of white paper,” and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.”"
"But no one was able to do it. The King said, “The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.” Then said the shepherd boy, “In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.”"
"The King said, “Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.”"
153 The Star-Money
"There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious."
"And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God. Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!” She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God bless it to thy use,” and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.” So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave away that also. And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life."
154 The Stolen Farthings
"A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them. And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o’clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in. It did not look around, and it did not speak; but went straight into the next room. Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner. On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way. At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged? “I have never seen it,” said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong. The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing. On this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in. Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and digging and seeking about industriously amongst the crevices between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared. He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, “Ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago.” They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man; it, however, had thought, “Thou canst buy thyself a biscuit for that,” and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards; and therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings. The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again."
155 Brides On Their Trial
"There was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult to him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, “Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it.” The youth did so; the first, however, swallowed the cheese with the rind on; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also; the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, “Take the third for thy wife.” This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her."
156 Odds And Ends
"There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent. When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself. A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,—"
"“Ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my odds and ends.”"
"The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it?"
"Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife."
"All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, “We are quarrelling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other. The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to thee.” “How can you dispute about an old cap?” said the youth. “Thou dost not know what properties it has! It is a wishing-cap; whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there.” “Give me the cap,” said the youth, “I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.” He put it on and went away, and thought of the King’s daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward. At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, “Ah, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,” and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle."
"He entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the King’s daughter. But how shocked he was when he saw her. She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. “Are you the King’s daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?” cried he."
"“Ah,” she answered, “this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.” She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, “How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.” She said, “He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,” she added, “so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.”"
"“Nothing can keep me from doing it,” said he, “but tell me what I must do.” “Thou shalt know everything,” said the King’s daughter; “when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.”"
"The youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him. After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal’s body, and it fell down. Instantly a fiery bird arose from it, and was about to fly away, but the young man’s brother, the eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down, hunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in its extremity, it let the egg fall. The egg did not, however, fall into the sea, but on a fisherman’s hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house, they streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire. The other brother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the water up on high. When the fire was extinguished, the youth sought for the egg and happily found it; it was not yet melted, but the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the water, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt."
"When the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him, the latter said, “My power is destroyed, and from this time forth thou art the King of the Castle of the Golden Sun. With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form.” Then the youth hastened to the King’s daughter, and when he entered the room, she was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other."
198 Maid Maleen
"There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful."
"As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.” Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.” Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls."
"What else could they do but lament and complain? Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.” She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out. The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible. When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants."
"They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles. When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them. At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions."
"The son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked."
"The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen. When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen thee. I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!” Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.” It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold. At last she said angrily, “If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life. I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.” Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.” The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.” He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"“What art thou saying?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” “Dost thou know Maid Maleen?” “No,” she answered, “how should I know her; I have only heard of her.” When they came to the church-door, she said once more,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked he. “Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way. When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom."
"When the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince’s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception. As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”"
“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”
"“If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,” said he."
"So she bethought herself, and said,"
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me.”"
"She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?” “I said nothing but,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"The bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard."
“But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?”
asked the King’s son. “To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”
"She again said,"
own daughter had once belonged to another--father.  He had told the
"lawyer in a measured voice that he would see the fellow damned first, and"
"had directed a deed of separation to be prepared, which should provide"
for the complete payment of Fiorsen's existing debts on condition that he
"left Gyp and the baby in peace.  After telling Gyp this, he took an"
opportunity of going to the extempore nursery and standing by the baby's
"cradle.  Until then, the little creature had only been of interest as"
"part of Gyp; now it had for him an existence of its own--this tiny,"
"dark-eyed creature, lying there, watching him so gravely, clutching his"
"finger.  Suddenly the baby smiled--not a beautiful smile, but it made on"
Winton an indelible impression.
"Wishing first to settle this matter of the deed, he put off going down to"
"Mildenham; but ""not trusting those two scoundrels a yard""--for he never"
failed to bracket Rosek and Fiorsen--he insisted that the baby should not
"go out without two attendants, and that Gyp should not go out alone.  He"
carried precaution to the point of accompanying her to Monsieur Harmost's
"on the Friday afternoon, and expressed a wish to go in and shake hands"
with the old fellow.  It was a queer meeting.  Those two had as great
difficulty in finding anything to say as though they were denizens of
"different planets. And indeed, there ARE two planets on this earth!"
"When, after a minute or so of the friendliest embarrassment, he had"
"retired to wait for her, Gyp sat down to her lesson."
Monsieur Harmost said quietly:
"""Your letter was very kind, my little friend--and your father is very"
"kind.  But, after all, it was a compliment your husband paid me.""  His"
"smile smote Gyp; it seemed to sum up so many resignations.  ""So you stay"
"again with your father!""  And, looking at her very hard with his"
"melancholy brown eyes, ""When will you find your fate, I wonder?"""
you a thousand times you keep no watch? I have a great mind to stand
half a dozen of you up against that wall. Escaped with my entire command
"about the rogue's home-nest! Well, set a torch to it and see if he is"
"lurking anywhere about the crevices like a centipede in a crack!"""
Cabrera felt that he had wasted a great deal of time on a fine morning
"without shooting somebody, and it would certainly have gone ill with Don"
Luis or his brother if either of them had been compelled by the flames
to issue forth from the burning mill-house of Sarria.
But they were not there. The cur dogs of the village and a few
half-starved mongrels that followed the troops had great sport worrying
the rats which darted continually from the burning granaries. But of the
"more important human rats, no sign."
"All the inhabitants of the village were there likewise, held back from"
plundering by the bayonets of the Carlist troops. They stood recounting
"to each other, wistfully, the stores of clothes, the silk curtains, the"
"uncut pieces of broadcloth, the household linen, the great eight-day"
clocks in their gilt ormolu cases. Every woman had something to add to
the catalogue. Every householder felt keenly the injustice of
permitting so much wealth to be given to the crackling flames.
"""Yes, it was very well,"" they said; ""doubtless the Fernandez family were"
"vermin to be burned up--smoked out. But they possessed much good gear,"
the gathering of many years. These things have committed no treason
against either Don Carlos or the Regent Cristina. Why then are we not
permitted to enter and remove the valuables? It is monstrous. We will
"represent the matter to General Cabrera--to Don Carlos himself!"""
"But one glance at the former, as he sat his horse, nervously twisting"
"the reins and watching the destruction from under his black brows, made"
"home needs, and the industry is as yet largely prosecuted in an"
unsystematic and haphazard manner. It is claimed that sample shipments
"of coffee brought high prices in New York, but as yet not enough is"
"grown to permit exportation. Cacao, which thrives, is grown chiefly by"
"English and German planters, but as yet in a small way only. Cotton,"
tobacco and fiber plants also grow readily in this region but are little
cultivated.

"There being a dearth of newspapers and readers, new laws are promulgated"
by being read aloud]
"A curious industry of the Chiriqui country, now nearly abandoned, was"
the collection of gold ornaments which the Guaymi Indians formerly
"buried with their dead. These images sometimes in human form, more often"
"in that of a fish, sometimes like frogs and alligators, jointed and"
"flexible, were at one time found in great quantities and formed a"
conspicuous feature of the Panama curiosity shops. In seeking these the
hunters walked back and forth over the grounds known to be Indian burial
"places, tapping the ground with rods. When the earth gave forth a hollow"
"sound the spade was resorted to, and usually a grave was uncovered. Jars"
"which had contained wine and food were usually found in the graves,"
which were in fact subterranean tombs carefully built with flat stones.
The diggers tell of finding skulls perfectly preserved apparently but
which crumbled to pieces at a touch. Evidently the burial places which
"can be identified through local tradition have been nearly exhausted,"
for the ancient trinkets cannot longer be readily found in the Panama
shops.
[Illustration: THE CATTLE RANGE NEAR DAVID
Spanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers
"started back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200"
"pack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with"
a large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the
"command of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan."
"On their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal"
"of quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a"
"few friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful"
"followers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as"
their share of the spoils.
"On May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to"
"Morgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that"
"in July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between"
"Spain and England for ""restraining depredations and establishing peace"" in"
the New World.
"In April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the"
"_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being"
"acquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,"
he was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General
"Banister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to"
"Lord Arlington about Morgan, said: ""He (Morgan) is a well deserving"
"person, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's"
"pleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to"
"this island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards."""
While Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William
"Crooke, the publisher of the ""History of the Bucaniers of America."" The"
result of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and
published a long and grovelling apology.
"Mediterranean. But coal, he had found, had risen to a ruinous price in"
consequence of a recent strike among the miners in England; and for even
"the most trifling repairs he would have to wait at least a week, because"
the dock-yard people were already working over-time to make way for a
man-of-war. Credit of any sort was not to be had. His portage-bill bade
fair to swamp his insufficient cash resources--even although three of
his now scanty crew had already deserted. And who could foretell what
might happen to him if they should get wagging their tongues too freely
"in some wine-shop ashore! While, as if for climax, the Customs'"
authorities had been displaying a most suspicious interest in him and
"his ship. Under such circumstances, even a saint might have been"
"pardoned, as he pointed out, for showing a temper something short of"
seraphic.
"""And you've been doing me good turns--by your way of it--for some time"
"past,"" he continued, in a stifled, vehement whisper lest his voice"
"should still reach the receding boat. ""Though--"" He waved a claw-like"
"hand about him, words again failing him to describe adequately his"
"sufferings in consequence, as who should say, ""See the result for"
"yourself."""
"Slyne sat down on the sofa opposite him, not even condescending to"
"glance, in response to that invitation, round the squalid,"
"poverty-stricken little cabin. ""Never mind about some time past,"" he"
"advised, more pacifically. ""You'll never get rich quick yesterday."
"To-day's when _I'm_ going to make my pile. And I meant to let you in--"""
"""To another hole,"" Captain Dove concluded sceptically. ""I only wish"
"you'd show me some sure way out of the one I'm in."""
"Slyne looked his annoyance at that further interruption, and made as if"
"to rise, but did no more than draw his gold cigarette-case from its"
"word is given--to my people."""
"""I shall not plead with you,"" she returned steadily, ""and you may be"
sure I shall not waver. I am not afraid to die. I had hoped to atone
"for all the wrong that has been done you with my love for you, Nehal."
I had hoped that then you would turn away from this madness and become
once more our friend. To this end I have not hesitated to trample on
my dignity and pride. I have not spared myself. But you will not

Nehal Singh's brows knitted themselves in the anguish of a man who
"finds himself thwarted by his own nature. He tried not to believe her,"
"and indeed, in all her words, though they had rung like music, his"
"ear, tuned to suspicion, had heard the mocking undercurrent of"
laughter. She had laughed at him secretly through all those months
"when he had offered up to her the incense of an absolute faith, an"
"unshared devotion. Even now she might be laughing at him, playing on"
that in him which nothing could destroy or conceal--his love for her.
"And yet--! Behind him he heard the uneasy stir of impatient feet, the"
"hushed clash of arms. He stood between her and a certain, terrible"
"death. One word from him, and it would be over--his path clear. But he"
"could not speak that word. Treacherous and cruel as she had been, the"
halo of her first glory still hung about her. He saw her as he had
"first seen her--the golden image of pure womanhood--and, strange,"
"unreasoning contradiction of the human heart, beneath the ashes of his"
old faith a new fire had kindled and with every moment burned more
brightly. Unquenchable trust fought out a death struggle with
"distrust, and in that conflict her words recurred to him with poignant"
"significance: ""Death is the easiest, the kindest solution to it all."""
appears to have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that
the primordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air
"dissolved in water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the"
gullet. This sac evolved along two distinct lines. On the line of
the ancestry of most modern fishes its duct was closed and it
became the swim bladder used in flotation and balancing. On
"another line of descent it was left open, air was swallowed into"
"it, and it developed into the rudimentary lung of the dipnoans and"
into the more perfect lungs of the amphibians and other air-
breathing vertebrates.
One of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of
"the members of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in"
"armor, but their higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and"
by other structures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-
five feet in length and six feet across the head. They were the
tyrants of the Devonian seas.
GANOIDS. These take their name from their enameled plates or
scales of bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants
of the tribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of
"one of a leading order, the FRINGE-FINNED ganoids, is given in"
"Figure 301. The side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the"
"higher vertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes."
"Their rays, instead of radiating from a common base, fringe a"
central lobe which contains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the
Devonian ganoids show a complicated folded structure.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVONIAN FISHES. THE NOTOCHORD IS
"PERSISTENT. The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or"
"gristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals"
supports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the
"interior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier"
"Cambrian time the central land subsided, with much the same effect"
"as if the Mississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the"
Gulf of Mexico to spread northward until it entered Lake Superior.
The Cambrian seas transgressed the central land and strewed far
and wide behind their advancing beaches the sediments of the later
Cambrian upon an eroded surface of pre-Cambrian rocks.
The succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records
many minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical
geography; yet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering
lands. Basal conglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have
"been laid near shore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy"
"shales, and shales. Toward the top of the series heavy beds of"
"limestone, extending from the Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of"
"clear water, and either of more distant shores or of neighboring"
lands which were worn or sunk so low that for the most part their
waste was carried to the sea in solution.
"In brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with"
the larger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It
closed with most of the interior of the continental plateau
covered with a shallow sea.
THE LIFE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD
It is now for the first time that we find preserved in the
offshore deposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal
life to be properly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are
"only the most fragmentary representation of the life of the time,"
for the Cambrian rocks are very old and have been widely
metamorphosed. Yet the five hundred and more species already

PREFACE
The aim of this book is to serve as a companion to the _Mennonite
"Hymnary_. It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the"
words and music of every hymn in the _Hymnary_.
"The great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days"
"of the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration"
and power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love
"for our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and"
blessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.
The _Handbook_ may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private study of
hymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable hymns
for the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing
special music services or hymn sings where such occasions are planned to
improve the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in hymnology in
churches and schools. The historical development of hymnology may be
followed in the brief “Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes.”
The author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as possible
without overburdening the reader with too many details. Many hymns have
"interesting stories connected with their origin and use while others,"
"equally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident, the poet"
"scarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice spoke. The"
apocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning some hymns have
been studiously avoided. The aim has been to include only such material
as seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity. The bibliography of
"All disclaimed any precise information, and Lord Sandford spoke no word;"
"his brow was slightly furrowed, and there was a subdued gleam in his eye"
which warned those who saw it that something in the conversation was not
"to his mind.  They therefore hastened to change it, and many of them"
said adieu and sauntered away.  Only a small knot remained with their
"patron, discussing the plans for the day; and Grey stood still in the"
"embrasure of the window, his heart still beating with curious violence"
"and rapidity.  When those men were speaking of Geraldine, he had scarce"
been able to keep his fingers from their throats.  What business had
they taking her pure name upon their lips?  And why had they spoken of
her fortune?  Could it be true that she was so great an heiress?  He
hated to believe it; yet what was it to him?  He was wakened from his
"reverie by a quick question from Lord Sandford, which he heard as"
"through the mists of a dream, and answered,—"
"""’Tis true I am not quite myself.  I slept not at all last night, and"
have been on the river well-nigh since sunrise to rid me of the vapours.
Methinks I will seek some sleep in mine own rooms ere night. Reckon not
"on me for to-day’s pastime."""
"""Ay, you have the air of a man squeamish and in need of rest.  Go get"
"thee a good sleep, friend Grey, for we must keep you in fettle for the"
match on Saturday.  Man and beast must come to the field strong and
"robust, with nerve and wind and muscle true and taut.  But you must make"
one of our party to Vauxhall to-night.  There will be many bright eyes
"on the lookout for the gay cavalier, as the ladies call you for your"
"love-locks.  You must not fail us there."""
"For a moment Grey hesitated, prudence and passion fighting together for"
mastery.  But the overwhelming desire to see Geraldine again—perhaps to
"speak a word of farewell—overcame him, and he answered briefly as he"
"strolled through the room on his way out,—"
of Montaigne. In Erasmus's writings that ideal wish ever recurs in the
"shape of a friendly walk, followed by a meal in a garden-house. It is"
"found as an opening scene of the _Antibarbari_, in the numerous"
"descriptions of meals with Colet, and the numerous _Convivia_ of the"
_Colloquies_. Especially in the _Convivium religiosum_ Erasmus has
"elaborately pictured his dream, and it would be worth while to compare"
"it, on the one hand with Thélème, and on the other with the fantastic"
design of a pleasure garden which Bernard Palissy describes. The little
Dutch eighteenth-century country-seats and garden-houses in which the
national spirit took great delight are the fulfilment of a purely
Erasmian ideal. The host of the _Convivium religiosum_ says: 'To me a
"simple country-house, a nest, is pleasanter than any palace, and, if he"
"be king who lives in freedom and according to his wishes, surely I am"
king here'.
Life's true joy is in virtue and piety. If they are Epicureans who live
"pleasantly, then none are more truly Epicureans than they who live in"
holiness and piety.
The ideal joy of life is also perfectly idyllic in so far that it
requires an aloofness from earthly concerns and contempt for all that is
sordid. It is foolish to be interested in all that happens in the world;
"to pride oneself on one's knowledge of the market, of the King of"
"England's plans, the news from Rome, conditions in Denmark. The sensible"
"old man of the _Colloquium Senile_ has an easy post of honour, a safe"
"mediocrity, he judges no one and nothing and smiles upon all the world."
"Quiet for oneself, surrounded by books--that is of all things most"
desirable.
On the outskirts of this ideal of serenity and harmony numerous flowers
"of aesthetic value blow, such as Erasmus's sense of decorum, his great"
"need of kindly courtesy, his pleasure in gentle and obliging treatment,"
Eppendorf employs spies everywhere who watch Erasmus's correspondence
"with his friends. Aleander continually sets people to combat him, and"
lies in wait for him wherever he can. His interpretation of the
intentions of his assailants has the ingenious self-centred element
which passes the borderline of sanity. He sees the whole world full of
calumny and ambuscades threatening his peace: nearly all those who once
were his best friends have become his bitterest enemies; they wag their
"venomous tongues at banquets, in conversation, in the confessional, in"
"sermons, in lectures, at court, in vehicles and ships. The minor"
"enemies, like troublesome vermin, drive him to weariness of life, or to"
death by insomnia. He compares his tortures to the martyrdom of Saint
"Sebastian, pierced by arrows. But his is worse, for there is no end to"
it. For years he has daily been dying a thousand deaths and that alone;
"for his friends, if such there are, are deterred by envy."
He mercilessly pillories his patrons in a row for their stinginess. Now
and again there suddenly comes to light an undercurrent of aversion and
hatred which we did not suspect. Where had more good things fallen to
his lot than in England? Which country had he always praised more? But
suddenly a bitter and unfounded reproach escapes him. England is
"responsible for his having become faithless to his monastic vows, 'for"
"no other reason do I hate Britain more than for this, though it has"
always been pestilent to me'.
He seldom allows himself to go so far. His expressions of hatred or
"spite are, as a rule, restricted to the feline. They are aimed at"
"friends and enemies, Budaeus, Lypsius, as well as Hutten and Beda."
Occasionally we are struck by the expression of coarse pleasure at
"another's misfortune. But in all this, as regards malice, we should not"
measure Erasmus by our ideas of delicacy and gentleness. Compared with
most of his contemporaries he remains moderate and refined.
"swarm of angry wasps, and above us they seemed to remain, hovering and"
circling. We awaited the downward rush and the deafening thunder-clap
that would destroy us all. One man was groaning loudly. Another
shivered. I could hear the chattering of many teeth. My neighbour
trembled violently and cowered beneath his blankets. But his fear grew
so strong that he could not bear it any longer. He got up and said in a
"strained voice, trying to appear calm, ""I'm goin' to 'ave a look at"
"'em."" He ran out of the marquee and disappeared. I found my powers of"
resistance ebbing. I was unable to control my imagination. I saw my
comrades and myself blown to pieces. I saw the clerk in the office of
the C.C.S. write out the death-intimations on a buff slip and filling in
a form. I saw a telegraph boy taking the telegram to my home. He stopped
on the way in order to talk to a friend. Then he whistled and threw a
stone at a dog. He sauntered through the garden gate and knocked at the
"front door. The door opened ... but I could not face the rest, and with"
a tremendous mental impulse I turned my mind away to other things. But
my terrible thoughts lay in wait for me like tigers ready to rush upon
"me as soon as my will relaxed its efforts. I tried to compromise, and I"
imagined myself killed and invented all the details of a post-mortem
"examination and burial. I found some relief in these imaginings, but"
soon that implacable telegram claimed my attention once more and drew me
on to what I dared not face. I sought distraction by muttering some
"verses of poetry to myself. They had no meaning to me, they were just"
empty sound and their rhythm had a hideous pulsation like that other
pulsation overhead:
"""He above the rest"
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
"Stood like a tower...."""
"and so on, line after line. The dreariness of the verses grew so intense"
as to be almost intolerable. At the same time I was dimly conscious of
We marched to an extensive R.E. park and saw-mill near a railway siding.
We had to dismantle the machinery and load everything of any value on to
a train. For several hours five of us dragged a huge cylinder and piston
along the ground. We toiled and perspired. We made a ramp of heavy
wooden beams in front of the train and then we slowly pushed the iron
"mass into a truck. We went back and, raising a big fly-wheel on its edge"
"and supporting it with a wooden beam under each axle, we rolled it"
"painfully along, swaying from side to side."
"Then there came the long-drawn familiar whine, and the black smoke arose"
behind some trees a hundred yards away and the thunder-clap followed. A
jagged piece of steel came whizzing by and lodged in a stack of timber
behind us.
We pushed the wheel up the ramp and returned to fetch heavy coils of
"wire, bundles of picks and shovels, sacks and barrels of nails. Our"
"backs and shoulders ached, our hands and finger-tips were sore."
Another shell came whining over. It burst by a little cottage. Its
thunder made our ears sing. The fragments of flying metal made us duck
or scatter behind the stacks.
We worked until we almost dropped with sheer fatigue. Iron rods and bars
"for reinforcing pill-boxes, bags of cement, boxes of tools, parts of"
"machinery, all went on to the train. Then we entered a big shed, where"
a number of tar-barrels stood in a row. We rolled them out and placed
them by the timber stacks. We laid a pick beside each barrel so that it
"could be broached, the tar set alight, and the entire park destroyed at"
a moment's notice.
It was dark when we stopped work. We reached camp after an hour's
wearisome marching. We waited in a long queue outside the cook-house.
"ingenuity to keep them alive during the journey. Four plants, two"
"Mimosas and two Telegraph plants, were taken in a portable box with"
"glass cover, and never let out of sight. In the Mediterranean they"
encountered bitter cold for the first time and nearly succumbed. They
"were unhappier still in the Bay of Biscay, and when they reached London"
there was a sharp frost. They had to be kept in a drawing room lighted
"by gas, the deadly influence of which was discovered the next morning"
when all the plants were found to be apparently killed. Two had been
"killed, and the other two were brought round after much difficulty. The"
plants were at once transferred to the hot-house in Regents Park. For
"every demonstration in Dr. Bose's private Laboratory at Maida Vale, the"
plant had to be brought and returned in a taxicab with closed doors so
"that no sudden chill might kill them. When travelling, the large box in"
"which they were, could not be trusted out of sight in the luggage van."
They had practically to be carried in a reserved compartment. The
"unusual care taken of the box always roused the greatest curiosity, and"
in an incredibly short time large crowds would gather. When travelling
"long distances, for example from London to Vienna, the carriage"
accommodation had to be secured in advance. It was this that saved Dr.
"Bose from being interned in Germany, where he was to commence his"
lectures on the 4th August. He was to start for the University of Bonn
"on the 2nd, but on account of hasty mobilisation of troops in Germany he"
could not secure the reserved accommodation. Two days after came the
proclamation of War!
OUTCOME OF HIS WORK
The success of his scientific mission exceeded his most sanguine
expectations. The work in which he long persevered in isolation and
"under most depressing difficulties, bore fruit at last. Apart from the"
full recognition that the progress of the world's science would be
"have been splendid and of some use.” Given the character of the lady,"
"we might, as adults, question the last part of the boy's statement, but"
this is pure cynicism and fortunately does not enter into the child's
calculations.
In my own personal experience (and I have told this story often in the
German ballad form to girls of ten and twelve in the High Schools in
England) I have never found one girl who sympathised with the lady or
who failed to appreciate the poetic justice meted out to her in the end
by the dignified renunciation of the knight.
"Chesterton defines sentimentality as “a tame, cold, or small and"
inadequate manner of speaking about certain matters which demand very
large and beautiful expression.”
"I would strongly urge upon young teachers to revise, by this"
"definition, some of the stories they have included in their repertory,"
and see whether they would stand the test or not.
IV.--_Stories containing strong sensational episodes._ The danger is
"all the greater because many children delight in it, and some crave for"
"it in the abstract, but fear it in the concrete.[19]"
"An affectionate aunt, on one occasion, anxious to curry favour with"
"a four-year-old nephew, was taxing her imagination to find a story"
suitable for his tender years. She was greatly startled when he
"suddenly said, in a most imperative tone: “Tell me the story of a"
_bear_ eating a small boy.” This was so remote from her own choice
"of subject that she hesitated at first, but coming to the conclusion"
that as the child had chosen the situation he would feel no terror
"in the working up of its details, she began a most thrilling and"
"blood-curdling story, leading up to the final catastrophe. But just as"
and gone himself with their beautiful new motor--whatever _could_
"the chauffeur have thought?--to meet her at the prison gates,"
"_there_ he was, afterwards, worrying himself over the War: not"
"content as she was, as most of her friends were, as the newspapers"
"were, to leave it all to Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward"
"Grey, and even Mr. Lloyd George--though the latter had made some"
"rather foolish and exaggerated speeches about Alcohol. Michael, if"
"he went on like this, would _never_ get his knighthood!"
"Then when Michael had at last, thanks to General Armstrong, found"
his right place and was accomplishing marvels--the papers said--as a
"""mender of the maimed""--here was she left alone in Portland Place"
"with hardly any one to speak to, and all her acquaintances--she now"
realized they were scarcely her friends--too much occupied with war
work to spend an afternoon in discussing nothing very important over
"a sumptuous tea, still served by a butler and footman."
"Presently, too, the butler left to join the Professor in France and"
"the footman enlisted, and the tea had to be served by a _distraite_"
"parlour-maid, with her eye on a munitions factory--so that she"
"might be ""in it""--and her heart in the keeping of the footman, who,"
"since he had gone into khaki, was irresistible."
"Mrs. Rossiter of course said, in 1914, that she would take up war"
work. She subscribed most handsomely to the Soldiers' and Sailors'
"Families' Association, to the Red Cross, to the Prince of Wales's"
Fund (one of the unsolved war-time mysteries ... what's become of
"it?), to the Cigarette Fund, the 1914 Christmas Plum Pudding Fund,"
"the Blue Cross, the Purple Cross, the Green Cross funds; to the"
outstandingly good work at St. Dunstan's and at Petersham--(I am
glad she gave a Hundred pounds each to _them_); and to the
"French, Belgian, Russian, Italian, Serbian, Portuguese and Japanese"
"dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly"
shimmered.
"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! But if he cooks gold here,"
"I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" And he wanted to see, so he went"
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen; but a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter; yet whatever she
"might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his"
"days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden."
"""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be"
"your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the"
"master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard"
"work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing"
"more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you"
"do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten"
fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I'll tell you how to go about it. You
"must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything"
"will fly out by itself."""
"This he would do, said the king's son; and he sat there with her all day"
"long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's"
"daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not"
"weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must"
"clean out the stable before the giant came, and when he got there he"
"thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he"
"had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop"
"quickly, for after he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in"
"which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned"
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
"to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,"
"whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have"
"as Tannin, etc."
CONVULSANT.--A medicine which causes violent and unnatural contractions
"of muscles (convulsions) as Nux Vomica or its derivative, etc."
CORDIAL.--A medicine which increases the strength and raises the
"vitality when depressed, as Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia, Alcohol, etc."
CORRECTIVE or CORRECTANT.--A substance used to modify or make pleasant
"the action of a cathartic or other medicines, as Acacia, Coriander, etc."
CORROSIVE.--A substance that destroys organic tissue either by direct
"chemical means or by causing inflammation and suppuration, as Mercuric"
"Chloride, Nitric Acid, etc."
COUNTER IRRITANT.--A substance or medicine which produces superficial
"inflammation artificially in order to exercise a good effect, by"
"stimulating functional activity of a part, thus promoting repair upon"
"some adjacent or deep-seated morbid process, as Blistering or Firing,"
etc.
CUMULATIVE POISON.--A medicine which finally acts as a poison after
several successive doses have been taken with little or no apparent
"effect, as Arsenic, Strychnine, etc."
"DEBILITANT.--A medicine which diminishes the energy of organs, as"
"Bromide of Potassium, Lobelia, etc."
"DEFERVESCENT.--A medicine that reduces temperature, as Quinine Sulphate,"
"Aconite, etc."
"DELIRIANT OR DELIRIFACENT.--A medicine which produces delirium, as"
not to be shaken. It may be well imagined that the feeding of my
chauffeur during the months to come loomed up as one of my minor
anxieties.
"From Pindi I went to Quetta by train, my car, with the native"
"chauffeur having gone direct to the then rail-head at Nushki, in the"
North of Indo-Baluchistan.
"At Quetta I laid in a store of petrol, spare tyres, a few personal"
"necessities, reported to General Grover for orders and information,"
"and then proceeded to Nushki; which place was reached, and the car"
"picked up, on, if I remember rightly, the 25th of February."
This day in Nushki was to prove the last in a civilised town for
many months to come. The look of the country lying before us so
"intimidated my native chauffeur that he came to me, a short time"
"before we were due to start, with a countenance torn with grief and,"
"with lamentations and protestations of sorrow, told me that both his"
"father and mother were ill, and that it was vital for him to return"
and succour them. As I had been in two minds as to the advisability
"of taking the rascal with me, this sign of the white feather at the"
"very outset at once decided the point, and I gave him to understand"
that he could go and bury as many of his relations as he pleased.
With a countenance swiftly transformed to cheerfulness he left me.
Just before starting a wire was handed in from a high political
official at Quetta informing me that the Baluch Raiders had already
"cut our lines of communication, were right across my path, and he"
"advised, if not ordered, me not to proceed."
"However, as explicit military instructions were to endeavour to reach"
"Robat (near the Koh-i-Maliksia), a hill at which the Baluch, Afghan"
Somehow as she sat there it seemed to Mrs. Warren it was going for
her to be the last hour of fully conscious life--fully conscious and
yet a curious mingling in it of the past and present. She had sat
"here in the middle of the 'seventies with Vivie's father, the young"
"Irish seminarist, her lover for six months. He had a vague interest"
"in botany, and during his convalescence after his typhoid fever,"
"when she was still his nurse, not yet his mistress, she used to"
bring him here to rest and to enjoy the aspect of these ferns and
palms. What a strange variety of men she had known. Some she had
"loved, more or less; some she had exploited frankly. Some--like"
"George Crofts and Baxendale Strangeways--she had feared, though in"
her manner she had tried to conceal her dread of their violence.
"Well! she had taken a lot of money off the rich, but she had never"
plundered the poor. Her greatest conquest--and that when she was a
woman of forty--was the monarch of this very country which now lay
crushed under the Kaiser's heel. For a few months he had taken a
"whimsical liking to her handsome face, well-preserved figure, and"
amusing cockney talk. But he had employed her rather as the mistress
"of his menus plaisirs, as his recruiting agent. He had rewarded her"
handsomely. Now it was all in the dust: her beautiful Villa
Beau-séjour a befouled barrack for German soldiers. She herself a
"homeless woman, repudiated by the respectable British and Americans"
more or less interned in this unhappy city.
Not much more than a year ago she had been one of the most respected

thousand pounds in bank notes that might turn out next month to be

"precious sum on her person? Suppose, whilst they were out, looking"
The text passes on to an enumeration of the case of an ewe giving birth to
more than two lambs. The 'official' interpretations are throughout
"unfavorable[49], and the priests were quite safe in their entries which"
"were purely arbitrary in these cases, since such multiple births never"
occurred. It is worth while to quote these interpretations as an
"illustration of the fanciful factor that, as already indicated, played a"
not insignificant part in the system unfolded.
"If an ewe gives birth to three (lambs), the prosperity of the country"
"will be annulled, but things will go well with the owner of the ewe,"
his stall will be enlarged.
"If an ewe gives birth to three fully developed (lambs), the dynasty"
"will meet with opposition, approach of an usurper, the country will"
be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, the land will encounter hostility, the"
"produce of the land will be swept away, approach of an usurper,"
destruction in the land.
"If an ewe gives birth to four fully developed lambs, [locusts (?)]"
will come and [destroy] the country.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, approach of an usurper, the country"
will be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to five, destruction will ravage the country,"
"the owner of the house will die, his stall will be destroyed."
"If an ewe gives birth to five, one with the head of a bull[50], one"
"with a lion-head, one with a jackal-head, one with a dog-head and one"
"preserve you from evil. Amen.'""[13]"
[Sidenote: The Benefits of Buying a Fac-simile of the Chains.]
In the sacristy we found a young priest doing a thriving business in
"copies of the relic. We bought from him ""an iron _fac-simile_ of the"
"chains (about the size of an ordinary watch-chain), authenticated by a"
certificate testifying to its having touched the original chains. On
the back of this certificate was printed an extract from the Rules of
"the Confraternity of the chains of St. Peter, from which we learned"
that all associates in this brotherhood must wear such a _fac-simile_
"as we had just bought, that the objects of the Confraternity are ""The"
"propagation of the veneration of the chains of St. Peter, an increase"
"of devotion to the Holy See, prayers for the Pope's intention, for the"
"needs of Holy Church, the conversion of infidels and sinners, and the"
"extirpation of heresy and blasphemy,"" and that Pius IX. had granted to"
"the members of the Confraternity various indulgences, one of which is"
"""_A plenary indulgence and remission of all sins_[14] if one visits the"
"Church of San Pietro in Vincoli on January 18th[15] and June 29th,[16]"
"between the first vespers of the feast and sunset of the said days,"
"or on August 1st, or any one of the seven days following it. The usual"
"prayers for the Holy Father's intention,"" etc., are comprised in these"
"visits. We are told also that ""the foregoing indulgences are applicable"
"to the souls in purgatory."""
[Sidenote: The Relics in St. Peter's Cathedral.]
We may close this running account of the relics at Rome with a brief
"mention of those that are to be seen in St. Peter's itself, the largest"
and costliest church in the world. The construction of it extended
over one hundred and seventy-six years. The cost of the main building
alone was fifty million dollars. The annual outlay for repairs is
"_T. Trusty._ Ye say full true, i-wis."
"In 1566 was acted at Christ's College, Cambridge, 'A Ryght Pithy,"
"Pleasaunt, and merie Comedie, intytuled _Gammer Gurton's Needle_.' The"
"authorship is uncertain, recent investigation having exalted a certain"
Stevenson into rivalry with the Bishop Still to whom former scholars
were content to assign it. Possibly as the result of a perusal of
"Plautus, possibly under the influence of the last play--for in subject"
matter it is even more perfectly English than _Ralph Roister
"Doister_--this comedy is also built on a well-arranged plan, the plot"
developing regularly through five acts with subsidiary scenes. Let us
glance through it.
"Gammer Gurton and her goodman Hodge lose their one and only needle, an"
"article not easily renewed, nor easily done without, seeing that Hodge's"
"garments stand in need of instant repair. Gib, the cat, is strongly"
"suspected of having swallowed it. Into this confusion steps Diccon, a"
"bedlam beggar, whose quick eye promptly detects opportunities for"
"mischief. After scaring Hodge with offers of magic art, he goes to Dame"
"Chat, an honest but somewhat jealous neighbour, unaware of what has"
"happened, with a tale that Gammer Gurton accuses her of stealing her"
best cock. To Gammer Gurton he announces that he has seen Dame Chat pick
up the needle and make off with it. Between the two dames ensues a
"meeting, the nature of which may be guessed, the whole trouble lying in"
the fact that neither thinks it necessary to name the article under
dispute. No wonder that discussion under the disadvantage of so great a
"misunderstanding ends in violence. Doctor Rat, the curate, is now called"
in; but again Diccon is equal to the occasion. Having warned Dame Chat
"that Hodge, to balance the matter of the cock, is about to creep in"
"through a breach in the wall and kill her chickens, he persuades Doctor"
Rat that if he will creep through this same opening he will see the
needle lying on Dame Chat's table. The consequences for the curate are
It was an early rumour of this intention which had so stirred the
"resentment of Don Baltasar Varela, and caused him to look about for some"
instrument of vengeance to prevent the accomplishment of the designs of
"""that _burro_ of the English Stock Exchange,"" as his enemies freely"
named Mendizábal.
"But Cristina of Naples was a typical woman of the Latin races, and,"
however strongly she might be determined to establish her daughter on
"the throne of Spain, she was also a good Catholic, and any oppression of"
Holy Church was abhorrent to her nature.
"Upon this probability, which amounted to certainty in his mind, the"
Abbot of Montblanch resolved to proceed.
"Moreover, it was an open secret that a few months after the death of her"
"husband Fernando, Cristina had married Muñoz, one of the handsomest"
"officers of her bodyguard. For this and other Bourbon delinquencies,"
"conceived in the good old Neapolitan manner, the Spaniards generally had"
the greatest respect--not even being scandalized when the Queen created
"her new partner Duke of Rianzares, or when, in her _rôle_ of honorary"
"colonel of dragoons, she appeared in a uniform of blue and white,"
"because these were the colours of the ""Immaculate Conception."""
But enough has been said to indicate the nature of the adventure which
"our hero had before him, when after a toilsome march the party halted in"
the grey of the dawn in a tiny dell among the wild mountains of
Guadarrama.
"The air was still bleak and cold, though luckily there was no wind."
"Concha, the child of the south, shivered a little as Rollo aided her to"
"dismount, and this must be the young man's excuse for taking his blue"
"military cloak from its coil across his saddle-bow, and wrapping it"
"Painted red, as if with blood, it looked like a cruel machine which,"
"though not working, opened a row of deep, hungry, gaping jaws, as if"
ready to devour and swallow anything.  The grey wooden eating-house of
"Vaviloff, with its bent roof covered with patches, leaned against one"
"of the brick walls of the factory, and seemed as if it were some large"
form of parasite clinging to it.  The Captain was thinking that they
would very soon be making new houses to replace the old building.
"""They will destroy the dosshouse even,"" he reflected.  ""It will be"
"necessary to look out for another, but such a cheap one is not to be"
found.  It seems a great pity to have to leave a place to which one is
"accustomed, though it will be necessary to go, simply because some"
"merchant or other thinks of manufacturing candles and soap.""  And the"
Captain felt that if he could only make the life of such an enemy
"miserable, even temporarily, oh! with what pleasure he would do it!"
"Yesterday, Ivan Andreyevitch Petunikoff was in the dosshouse yard with"
his son and an architect.  They measured the yard and put small wooden
"sticks in various places, which, after the exit of Petunikoff and at"
"the order of the Captain, Meteor took out and threw away.  To the eyes"
of the Captain this merchant appeared small and thin.  He wore a long
"garment like a frock-coat, a velvet cap, and high, well-cleaned boots."
"He had a thin face with prominent cheekbones, a wedge-shaped greyish"
"beard, and a high forehead seamed with wrinkles from beneath which"
"shone two narrow, blinking, and observant grey eyes ... a sharp,"
"gristly nose, a small mouth with thin lips ... altogether his"
"appearance was pious, rapacious, and respectably wicked. ""Cursed"
"cross-bred fox and pig!"" swore the Captain under his breath, recalling"
his first meeting with Petunikoff. The merchant came with one of the
"town councillors to buy the house, and seeing the Captain asked his"
companion:
"""Is this your lodger?"""
given to wickedness.
Down in the shady angle of the little orchard the old gipsy found a
"little garden of flowers, geranium and white jasmine, perhaps planted to"
"cast into the rude coffin of a neighbour, _Yerba Luisa_, or lemon"
"verbena for the decoctions of a simple pharmacopoeia, on the outskirts"
of these a yet smaller plot had been set aside. It was edged with white
"stones from the hillside, and many coloured bits of broken crockery"
decorated it. A rose-bush in the midst had been broken down by some
"hasty human foot, or perhaps by a bullock or other large trespassing"
animal. There were nigh a score of rose-buds upon it--all now parched
"and dead, and the whole had taken on the colour of the soil."
La Giralda stood a moment before laying her burden down. She had the
strong heart of her ancient people. The weakness of tears had not
"visited her eyes for years--indeed, not since she was a girl, and had"
"cried at parting from her first sweetheart, whom she never saw again. So"
she looked apparently unmoved at the pitiful little square of cracked
"earth, edged with its fragments of brown and blue pottery, and at the"
"broken rose-bush lying as if also plague-stricken across it, dusty,"
"desolate, and utterly forlorn. Yet, as we have said, was her heart by no"
"means impervious to feeling. She had wonderful impulses, this parched"
mahogany-visaged Giralda.
"""It is the little one's own garden--I will lay her here!"" she said to"
herself.
So without another word she departed in search of mattock and spade. She
"found them easily and shortly, for the hireling servants of the house"
"had fled in haste, taking nothing with them. In a quarter of an hour the"
"hole was dug. The rose-tree, being in the way, was dragged out and"
"thrown to one side. La Giralda, who began to think of her donkey and"
"the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet"
(Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior
"superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2"
inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was
then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was
"carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River"
"on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,"
"especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;"
the bowels were confined.
"When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained"
"of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but"
was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness
around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted
"four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and"
"containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature"
"102°. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and"
little furred.
"The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the"
"local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had"
passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local
"incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid"
flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall
"opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was"
"found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas"
"escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel"
could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards
"three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that"
about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided
with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.
"The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean"
"the new light. Away to the left there is even a row of small houses,"
like a row of railway-mens' dwellings. Strange and familiar sight. And
the station precincts are disorderly and rather dilapidated. I think of
our Sicilian host.
"The brown woman gives us coffee, and very strong, rich goats' milk, and"
bread. After which the q-b and I set off once more along the road to the
village. She too is thrilled. She too breathes deep. She too feels
"_space_ around her, and freedom to move the limbs: such as one does not"
"feel in Italy and Sicily, where all is so classic and fixed."
"The village itself is just a long, winding, darkish street, in shadow,"
of houses and shops and a smithy. It might almost be Cornwall: not
"quite. Something, I don't know what, suggests the stark burning glare of"
"summer. And then, of course, there is none of the cosiness which"
climbing roses and lilac trees and cottage shops and haystacks would
"give to an English scene. This is harder, barer, starker, more dreary."
An ancient man in the black-and-white costume comes out of a hovel of a
cottage. The butcher carries a huge side of meat. The women peer at
us--but more furtive and reticent than the howling stares of Italy.
"So we go on, down the rough-cobbled street through the whole length of"
"the village. And emerging on the other side, past the last cottage, we"
"find ourselves again facing the open country, on the gentle down-slope"
"of the rolling hill. The landscape continues the same: low, rolling"
"upland hills, dim under the yellow sun of the January morning: stone"
"fences, fields, grey-arable land: a man slowly, slowly ploughing with a"
pony and a dark-red cow: the road trailing empty across the distance:
"and then, the one violently unfamiliar note, the enclosed cemetery lying"
"outside on the gentle hill-side, closed in all round, very compact,"
with high walls: and on the inside face of the enclosure wall the marble
"slabs, like shut drawers of the sepulchres, shining white, the wall"
of periods when they became more numerous.
ECHINODERMS. This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar
"forms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The"
structure of echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened
with plates or particles of carbonate of lime.
"Of the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin,"
"the former has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but"
neither have so far been discovered in the strata of this period
in North America. The stemmed and lower division of the
"echinoderms was represented by a primitive type, the CYSTOID, so"
"called from its saclike form, A small globular or ovate ""calyx"" of"
"calcareous plates, with an aperture at the top for the mouth,"
"inclosed the body of the animal, and was attached to the sea"
bottom by a short flexible stalk consisting of disks of carbonate
of lime held together by a central ligament.
"ARTHOPODS. These segmented animals with ""jointed feet,"" as their"
"name suggests, may be divided in a general way into water"
breathers and air breathers. The first-named and lower division
"comprises the class of the CRUSTACEA,--arthropods protected by a"
"hard exterior skeleton, or ""crust,""--of which crabs, crayfish, and"
"lobsters are familiar examples. The higher division, that of the"
"air breathers, includes the following classes: spiders, scorpions,"
"centipedes, and insects."
"THE TRILOBITE. The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated"
before the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found
"in the Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in"
"numbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading"
"crustacean type is the TRILOBITE, which takes its name from the"
"hollow beneath Segovia. Others, breaking up into parties of from a dozen"
"to a hundred, had betaken themselves over the mountains in the direction"
of Madrid.
So the Queen-Regent and the handsome Señor Muñoz remained perforce at La
"Granja, for the two-fold reason that the palace of Madrid was reported"
"to be in the hands of a rebellious mob, and that the disbanding troops"
"had removed with them every sort and kind of conveyance, robbed the"
"stables of the horses, and plundered the military armoury of every"
useful weapon.
"They had not, however, meddled with the treasures of the palace, nor"
"offered any indignity to the Queen-Regent, or to any of the inmates of"
"La Granja. But as the Sergeant well knew, not thus would these be"
"treated by the roving bands of gipsies, who in a few hours would be"
"storming about the defenceless walls. No resource of oriental torture,"
no refinement of barbarity would be omitted to compel the Queen and her
consort to give up the treasures without which it was well known that
"they never travelled. Obviously, therefore, there was no time to be"
lost.
"They went swiftly round the angle of the palace, their feet making no"
sound on the clean delicious sward of those lawns which make the place
"such a marvel in the midst of tawny, dusty, burnt-up Spain. In a brief"
space the party arrived unnoted and unchecked under the wall of the
northern part.
"Lights still burnt in two or three windows on the second floor, though"
all was dark on the face which the palace turned towards the south and
the town of San Ildefonso.
"""These are the windows of the rooms occupied by my lady the"
"where the _Malplaquet_ was fitting out, and we left the rest to our"
personal charms.
"Cary was right. The Commander was a very fine fellow, an English naval"
officer of the best type. He confirmed the views I had frequently
heard expressed by others of his profession that no hatred exists
between English and German sailors. They leave that to middle-aged
"civilians who write for newspapers. The German Navy, in his opinion,"
"was ""a jolly fine Service,"" worthy in high courage and skill to"
contest with us the supremacy of the seas. He had been through the
China troubles as a lieutenant in the _Monmouth_--afterwards sunk by
"German shot off Coronel--knew von Spee, von Mueller, and other officers"
"of the Pacific Squadron, and spoke of them with enthusiasm. ""They sunk"
some of our ships and we wiped out theirs. That was all in the way of
business. We loved them in peace and we loved them in war. They were
splendidly loyal to us out in China--von Spee actually transferred
some of his ships to the command of our own senior officer so as to
"avoid any clash of control--and when it came to fighting, they fought"
like gentlemen. I grant you that their submarine work against merchant
"ships has been pretty putrid, but I don't believe that was the choice"
of their Navy. They got their orders from rotten civilians like Kaiser
"Bill."" Imagine if you can the bristling moustache of the Supreme War"
Lord could he have heard himself described as a civilian!
"Our guest had commanded a destroyer in the Jutland battle, and assured"
us that the handling of the German battle squadrons had been masterly.
"""They punished us heavily for just so long as they were superior in"
"strength, and then they slipped away before Jellicoe could get his"
blow in. They kept fending us off with torpedo attacks until the night
"came down, and then clean vanished. We got in some return smacks after"
"dark at stragglers, but it was very difficult to say how much damage"
"we did. Not much, I expect. Still it was a good battle, as decisive in"
"says, ""we were not overstocked with powder."""
"It was in March, 1710, that Rogers brought his little fleet into the"
"harbour of Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. Although at war with Spain,"
the captain soon became on his usual friendly terms with the Governor of
"this Spanish colony, and gave an entertainment on board his ship to him"
"and four other Spanish gentlemen, making them ""as welcome as time and"
"place would afford, with musick and our sailors dancing."" The Governor"
"gave a return party on shore, to which Rogers and all his brother officers"
"were invited, partaking of ""sixty dishes of various sorts."" After this"
"feast Rogers gave his host a present, consisting of ""two negro boys"
"dress'd in liveries."" One other instance of Woodes Rogers adaptability"
must suffice. In the year 1717 he was appointed Governor to the Bahama
"Islands, at New Providence, now called Nassau. His chief duty was to stamp"
out the West India pirates who had made this island their headquarters for
"many years, and were in complete power there, and numbered more than 2,000"
"desperadoes, including such famous men as Vane and Teach. Rogers's only"
"weapon, besides the man-of-war he arrived in, was a royal proclamation"
from King George offering free pardon to all pirates or buccaneers who
would surrender at once to the new Governor. At first the pirates were
"inclined to resist his landing, but in the end the tactful Rogers got his"
"own way, and not only landed, but was received by an armed guard of"
"honour, and passed between two lines of pirates who fired salutes with"
their muskets.
"Most of the pirates surrendered and received their pardons, but some, who"
reverted shortly afterwards to piracy and were captured and brought back
"to New Providence, were tried and actually hanged by Rogers's late"
buccaneer subjects.
Woodes Rogers eventually died in Nassau in the year 1729.
of English history from the earliest times down to the Revolution of
"1688. This last event inspired him with special interest, because the"
"Whigs and their philosophic champion, Locke, maintained that James II."
had violated the original contract between prince and people.
Everywhere in his notes Napoleon emphasizes the incidents which led to
"conflicts between dynasties or between rival principles. In fact,"
through all these voracious studies there appear signs of his
"determination to write a history of Corsica; and, while inspiriting"
"his kinsmen by recalling the glorious past, he sought to weaken the"
"French monarchy by inditing a ""Dissertation sur l'Autorité Royale."""
His first sketch of this work runs as follows:
"""23 October, 1788. Auxonne."
"""This work will begin with general ideas as to the origin and the"
enhanced prestige of the name of king. Military rule is favourable
to it: this work will afterwards enter into the details of the
usurped authority enjoyed by the Kings of the twelve Kingdoms of
Europe.
"""There are very few Kings who have not deserved dethronement[12]."""
This curt pronouncement is all that remains of the projected work. It
"sufficiently indicates, however, the aim of Napoleon's studies. One"
and all they were designed to equip him for the great task of
re-awakening the spirit of the Corsicans and of sapping the base of
the French monarchy.
But these reams of manuscript notes and crude literary efforts have an
even wider source of interest. They show how narrow was his outlook on
life. It all turned on the regeneration of Corsica by methods which he
"himself prescribed. We are therefore able to understand why, when his"
"Thus there is no escape, no loophole for a delusive hope, only the"
cultivation of the courage of sorrow.
There are never any exceptions to the laws of the Buddha. If a law is a
"law, that is the end of it. Just as we know of no exceptions to the law"
"of gravitation, so there are no exceptions to the law of death."
"But although this may seem to be a religion of despair, it is not really"
so. This sorrow to which there is no relief is the selfishness of
"sorrow, the grief for our own loneliness; for of sorrow, of fear, of"
"pity for the dead, there is no need. We know that in time all will be"
"well with them. We know that, though there may be before them vast"
"periods of suffering, yet that they will all at last be in Nebhan with"
"us. And if we shall not know them there, still we shall know that they"
"are there, all of them--not one will be wanting. Purified from the lust"
"of life, white souls steeped in the Great Peace, all living things will"
attain rest at last.
"There is this remarkable fact in Buddhism, that nowhere is any fear"
"expressed of death itself, nowhere any apprehension of what may happen"
"to the dead. It is the sorrow of separation, the terror of death to the"
"survivors, that is always dwelt upon with compassion, and the agony of"
which it is sought to soothe.
That the dying man himself should require strengthening to face the King
of Terrors is hardly ever mentioned. It seems to be taken for granted
that men should have courage in themselves to take leave of life
"becomingly, without undue fears. Buddhism is the way to show us the"
"escape from the miseries of life, not to give us hope in the hour of"
death.
The localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite
"characteristic of this form of injury, and is a valuable aid to finding"
the openings during an operation.
"Fig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It"
"shows the localised ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here"
rather more extensive from the fact that the blood spreads more readily
in the submucous tissue.
[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Perforating Wounds of Small Intestine. A.
Entry; note circular outline and eversion of mucous membrane. B. Wound
"of exit; curved slit-like character, eversion of mucous membrane. Note"
"the localised ecchymosis, more abundant round exit aperture. (St."
Thomas's Hospital Museum)]
It will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the
regular outline and the small size of the wounds. Another feature not
illustrated by the figures should also be mentioned. In the ruptures of
intestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in
the gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the
"bowel, but in these injuries it was just as frequently at the mesenteric"
"margin. The importance of this factor is considerable, since wounds"
near the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by
"hæmorrhage, and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is"
"considerably multiplied, to say nothing of the danger from loss of"
blood.
"Beyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were"
occasionally cut. I saw instances of these in the case of the ascending
"colon, and in the small curvature of the stomach. The comparative fixity"
of the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance in the
production of this form of injury.
"in places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of"
"thin, close, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The"
Stromatopora are among the chief limestone builders of the
Silurian and Devonian periods.
"CORALS developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals"
"they secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the"
"polyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly"
"by the family of the CHOETETES, all species of which are long"
since extinct. The description of other types of corals will be
"given under the Silurian, where they first became abundant."
"ECHINODERMS. The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now"
"two higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish."
"The CRINOID, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the"
"cystoid in many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a"
"crown of plumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it"
creates currents by which particles of food are wafted to its
"mouth. Crinoids are rare at the present time, but they grew in the"
greatest profusion in the warm Ordovician seas and for long ages
thereafter. In many places the sea floor was beautiful with these
"graceful, flowerlike forms, as with fields of long-stemmed lilies."
"Of the higher, free-moving classes of the echinoderms, starfish"
"are more numerous than in the Cambrian, and sea urchins make their"
appearance in rare archaic forms.
CRUSTACEANS. Trilobites now reach their greatest development and
more than eleven hundred species have been described from the
rocks of this period. It is interesting to note that in many
species the segments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped
that they move freely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian
"ancestors, many of the Ordovician trilobites could roll themselves"
has been unbroken since its beginning.
5. THE CHANGE IN SPECIES HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DIFFERENTIATION.
Tracing the lines of descent of various animals and plants of the
"present backward through the divisions of geologic time, we find"
that these lines of descent converge and unite in simpler and
still simpler types. The development of life may be represented by
a tree whose trunk is found in the earliest ages and whose
branches spread and subdivide to the growing twigs of present
species.
6. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME HAS BEEN A
PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. In the earliest ages the only animals and
"plants on the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in"
structure; while succeeding ages have been characterized by the
"introduction of types more and more specialized and complex, and"
therefore of higher rank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian
contains the remains of only the humblest forms of the
"invertebrates. In the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian the"
invertebrates were represented in all their subkingdoms by a
"varied fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the lowest of the"
vertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their entry on the
"stage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the world in"
the Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange forms
which became more and more like those of the present as the long
ages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest
"product of the creative process, man."
"Just as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so"
"gradual, progressive change, or evolution, has characterized the"
history of life upon the planet. The evolution of the organic
kingdom from its primitive germinal forms to the complex and
corrected edition of the New Testament. He did not fail to request the
chiefs of conservative divinity at Louvain beforehand to state their
objections to his work. Briard of Ath declared he had found nothing
"offensive in it, after he had first been told all sorts of bad things"
"about it. 'Then the new edition will please you much better,' Erasmus"
"had said. His friend Dorp and James Latomus, also one of the chief"
"divines, had expressed themselves in the same sense, and the Carmelite"
Nicholas of Egmond had said that he had never read Erasmus's work. Only
"a young Englishman, Edward Lee, who was studying Greek at Louvain, had"
summarized a number of criticisms into ten conclusions. Erasmus had got
rid of the matter by writing to Lee that he had not been able to get
hold of his conclusions and therefore could not make use of them. But
"his youthful critic had not put up with being slighted so, and worked"
out his objections in a more circumstantial treatise.
"[Illustration: XVII. VIEW OF BASLE, 1548]"
Thus Erasmus set out for Basle once more in May 1518. He had been
obliged to ask all his English friends (of whom Ammonius had been taken
from him by death in 1517) for support to defray the expenses of the
"journey; he kept holding out to them the prospect that, after his work"
"was finished, he would return to England. In a letter to Martin Lypsius,"
"as he was going up the Rhine, he answered Lee's criticism, which had"
irritated him extremely. In revising his edition he not only took it but
"little into account, but ventured, moreover, this time to print his own"
translation of the New Testament of 1506 without any alterations. At the
same time he obtained for the new edition a letter of approval from the
"Pope, a redoubtable weapon against his cavillers."
At Basle Erasmus worked again like a horse in a treadmill. But he was
really in his element. Even before the second edition of the New
"Testament, the _Enchiridion_ and the _Institutio Principis Christiani_"
"4th February 1916. ""Many striking addresses were delivered on the"
occasion. Professor J.C. Bose in his masterly address went to the root
of the matter and pointed in an inspiring manner what should be done to
make the Hindu University worthy of its name. He deprecated a repetition
"of the Universities of the West."" He said:--"
In tracing the characteristic phenomenon of life from simple beginnings
"in that vast region which may be called unvoiced, as exemplified in the"
"world of plants, to its highest expression in the animal kingdom, one is"
repeatedly struck by the one dominant fact that in order to maintain an
organism at the height of its efficiency something more than a
mechanical perfection of its structure is necessary. Every living
"organism, in order to maintain its life and growth, must be in free"
communion with all the forces of the Universe about it.
STIMULUS WITHIN AND WITHOUT
"Further, it must not only constantly receive stimulus from without, but"
"must also give out something from within, and the healthy life of the"
organism will depend on these two fold activities of inflow and
"outflow. When there is any interference with these activities, then"
"morbid symptoms appear, which ultimately must end in disaster and death."
This is equally true of the intellectual life of a Nation. When through
narrow conceit a Nation regards itself self-sufficient and cuts itself
"from the stimulus of the outside world, then intellectual decay must"
inevitably follow.
SPECIAL FUNCTION OF A NATION
So far as regards the receptive function. Then there is another function
distinguished; it was all a question of genius. The Educational Service
"ought to be regarded not as a profession, but as a calling. Some men"
"were born to be teachers. It was not a question of race, of course; in"
"order to have an efficient educational system, there must be an"
"efficient organisation, but this should not be allowed to become"
"fossilised, and thus stand in the way of healthy growth."
"83,639. In the Presidency College a young man fresh from an English"
university was at once appointed a Professor regardless of his lack of
"experience, whereas an Indian who passed in highest examination with"
honours in India was appointed as an Assistant Professor. This grounding
often made him more efficient as a teacher than the Professor recruited
"from England. There were now several Professors in the college, in the"
"Provincial Service, who were highly qualified, and who lectured to the"
highest classes with very great success.
"83,640. In the Physics Department he had under his direction several"
Assistants who were so well qualified that they were allowed to give
"lectures to several classes. These Assistants, after their experience at"
"the Presidency College, would be best fitted to become Professors in the"
mofussil at Colleges. He would like to see them promoted to the higher
service after they had had experience. But before he gave them the
"highest positions, he would make it compulsory for them to go to Europe."
"83,641. A proportion of Europeans in the service was needed, but only as"
experts and not as ordinary teachers. Only the very best men should be
"obtained from Europe, and for exceptional cases. The general educational"
"work should be done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties"
of the country much better than any outsider.
"83,642. He advocated the direct recruitment of Indians in India by the"
"local government in consultation with the Secretary of State, rather"
found herself skirting the high-paled ironwork which confines the
"palace. She pursued her way towards the town, taking care, however, to"
look sharply about her so that she might miss nothing.
"The palace grounds seemed utterly deserted. The fountains slept; ""Fame"""
drove no longer her waters fifty yards into the air; the Frogs rested
from their ungrateful labours open-mouthed and gasping for breath. Not
"even a gardener was to be seen scratching weeds on a path, or in the"
dimmest distance passing at random across one of the deep-shaded
"avenues. An unholy quiet seemed to have settled upon the place, the"
"marvel of Castile, the most elevated of earthly palaces, broken only by"
"the sombre tolling of the chapel bell, which would cease for five"
"minutes without apparent reason, and then, equally without cause, begin"
all over again its lugubrious chime.
"Down the zigzags towards the town went La Giralda, the goats taking"
"advantage of the wider paths to stray further afield, and needing more"
"frequently the touch of the wand, which the old woman had taken from the"
donkey's load in order to induce them to proceed.
"As the gipsy passed along, a small shrill voice called upon her to stop,"
"and from a side walk, concealed by roses and oleander bushes, late"
"flowering because of the great elevation, a richly-dressed little girl"
came running. She ran at the top of her speed towards the gilt railings
which towered high above her head. Her age appeared to be about that of
the little girl whom La Giralda had buried among the pottery shards in
that other meaner garden up on the mountain side.
"""Stop,"" she cried imperiously, ""I bid you stop! I am the Queen, and you"
must obey me. I have not seen any one for five days except stupid old
"Susana, who will be after me in a moment. Stop, I tell you! I want to"
"see your goats milked. I love milk, and they will not give me enough,"
"burned; but the prince loved her so very tenderly, that after much"
"pleading he succeeded in having her saved from punishment, though only"
with the greatest difficulty.
"[Illustration: ""AND SO HE SAW THE LOVELY MAIDEN WHO WAS SEATED AMONG"
"ITS BRANCHES."""
--_Page 59_]
"When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of twice as many men as had"
first stood watch was again set about her; yet everything happened as
"before, only that this time the foster-mother said to her: ""Now you"
"shall grieve as I did when you let the moon slip out!"" The queen wept"
and pleaded--for when the foster-mother was there she could speak--but
without avail. Now the old queen insisted that she be burned. But the
prince once more succeeded in begging her free. When heaven gave her a
"third child, a three-fold guard was set about her. The foster-mother"
"came while the guard slept, took the child, cut its little finger, and"
"rubbed some of the blood on the queen's mouth. ""Now,"" said she, ""you"
"shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip out!"" And now the"
"prince could in no way save her, she was to be and should be burned."
"But at the very moment when they were leading her to the stake, the"
foster-mother appeared with all three children; the two older ones she
"led by the hand, the youngest she carried on her arm. She stepped up to"
"the young queen and said: ""Here are your children, for now I give them"
"back to you. I am the Virgin Mary, and the grief that you have felt is"
"the same grief that I felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the"
moon and the sun slip out. Now you have been punished for that which you
"did, and from now on the power of speech is restored to you!"""
"The happiness which then filled the prince and princess may be imagined,"
"but cannot be described. They lived happily together ever after, and"
from that time forward even the prince's mother was very fond of the
it was rumoured that leave was going to start. How glorious it would be
to spend a sunny May or June in England!
Once a fortnight we paraded for our pay outside one of the bigger sheds
"of the yard. As a rule, I was filled with impatience and irritation at"
"having to wait in a long queue and move forward step by step, but now it"
"had become pleasant to tarry in the sunshine. One day, when we were"
"lined up between two large huts, a deep Yellow Brimstone butterfly came"
"floating idly past. It gave me inexpressible delight, a delight tempered"
by sadness and a longing for better times. I drew my pay and saluted
"perfunctorily, being unable and unwilling to think of anything but the"
"beauty of the sky, the sun, and the wonderful insect."
"I held my three ten-franc notes in my hand and thought: ""I _will_ enjoy"
this lovely day to the full. When we get back to camp I will do without
"the repulsive army fare, I will dine at the St. Martin and buy a bottle"
"of the best French wine, even if it costs me twenty francs. And then"
I'll walk to the little wood on the hill-slope and there I'll lie all
"the evening and dream or read a book."""
The whistle sounded. It was time to go back to work. But I cursed the
work and decided to take the small risk and remain idle for an hour or
two. I went to an outlying part of the yard and sat down on a patch of
long grass and leant back against a shed. The air was hot and several
bees flew by. Their buzzing reminded me of summer holidays spent in
"southern France before the war. I thought of vineyards and orchards, of"
"skies intensely blue, of scorching sunshine, of the tumultuous chirping"
"of cicadas and grasshoppers, and then of the tepid nights crowded with"
glittering stars and hushed except for the piping of tree-frogs.
Before the war--before the war--I repeated the words to myself. They
"conveyed a sense of immeasurable remoteness, of something gone and lost"
"make nests and lay eggs and have little ones, and you went and shot"
them.' There are many sparrow-cotes to be seen in the villages.
"I might give example after example of this sort, for they happen every"
"day. We who are meat-eaters, who delight in shooting, who have a horror"
"of insects and reptiles, are continually coming into collision with the"
principles of our neighbours; for even harmful reptiles they do not care
"to kill. Truly I believe it is a myth, the story of the Burmese mother"
courteously escorting out of the house the scorpion which had just
bitten her baby. A Burmese mother worships her baby as much as the woman
"of any other nation does, and I believe there is no crime she would not"
commit in its behalf. But if she saw a scorpion walking about in the
"fields, she would not kill it as we should. She would step aside and"
"pass on. 'Poor beast!' she would say, 'why should I hurt it? It never"
hurt me.'
The Burman never kills insects out of sheer brutality. If a beetle drone
"annoyingly, he will catch it in a handkerchief and put it outside, and"
so with a bee. It is a great trouble often to get your Burmese servants
to keep your house free of ants and other annoying creatures. If you
"tell them to kill the insects they will, for in that case the sin falls"
on you. Without special orders they would rather leave the ants alone.
In the district in which I am now living snakes are very plentiful.
"There are cobras and keraits, but the most dreaded is the Russell's"
"viper. He is a snake that averages from three to four feet long, and is"
"very thick, with a big head and a stumpy tail. His body is marked very"
"prettily with spots and blurs of light on a dark, grayish green, and he"
"is so like the shadows of the grass and weeds in a dusty road, that you"
"can walk on him quite unsuspectingly. Then he will bite you, and you"
"die. He comes out usually in the evening before dark, and lies about on"
"footpaths to catch the home-coming ploughman or reaper, and, contrary to"
favour of the more difficult path. Dr. Bose chose the more difficult
"path, and entered into a phase of activity which was to test all his"
strength.
CASTE IN SCIENCE
Dr. Bose's discovery of Universal sensitiveness of matter was
"communicated to the Royal Society on May 7th, 1901, when he himself gave"
"a successful experimental demonstration. His communication was, however,"
"strongly assailed by Sir John Burden-Sanderson, the leading"
"physiologist, and one or two of his followers. They had nothing to urge"
against his experiments but objected to a physicist straying into the
preserve that had been specially reserved for the physiologist. He had
unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system
"and offended its etiquette. In consequence of this opposition his paper,"
"which was already in print, was not published. This is not by any means"
"to be regarded as an injustice done to a stranger. Even Lord Rayleigh,"
"who occupies an unique position in the world of science, was subjected"
"to fierce attacks from the chemists, because he, a physicist, had"
ventured to predict that the air would be found to contain new elements
not hitherto discovered.
"It is natural that there should be prejudice against all innovations,"
and the attitude of Sir John Burden-Sanderson is easily explained.
Unfortunately there was another incident about which similar explanation
could not be urged. Dr. Bose's Paper had been placed in the archives of
"the Royal Society, so that technically there was no publication. And it"
"came about that eight months after the reading of his Paper, another"
communication found publication in the Journal of a different society
which was practically the same as Dr. Bose's but without any
acknowledgment. The author of this communication was a gentleman who had
"beget children for the State and for Christ, says the lover, children"
"endowed by their upright parents with a good disposition, children who"
see the good example at home which is to guide them. Again and again he
reverts to the mother's duty to suckle the child herself. He indicates
"how the house should be arranged, in a simple and cleanly manner; he"
occupies himself with the problem of useful children's dress. Who stood
"up at that time, as he did, for the fallen girl, and for the prostitute"
compelled by necessity? Who saw so clearly the social danger of
"marriages of persons infected with the new scourge of Europe, so"
violently abhorred by Erasmus? He would wish that such a marriage should
at once be declared null and void by the Pope. Erasmus does not hold
"with the easy social theory, still quite current in the literature of"
"his time, which casts upon women all the blame of adultery and lewdness."
"With the savages who live in a state of nature, he says, the adultery of"
"men is punished, but that of women is forgiven."
"Here it appears, at the same time, that Erasmus knew, be it half in"
"jest, the conception of natural virtue and happiness of naked islanders"
in a savage state. It soon crops up again in Montaigne and the following
centuries develop it into a literary dogma.
CHAPTER XIII
ERASMUS'S MIND-CONTINUED
Erasmus's mind: Intellectual tendencies--The world encumbered by
beliefs and forms--Truth must be simple--Back to the pure
sources--Holy Scripture in the original languages--Biblical
humanism--Critical work on the texts of Scripture--Practice
certainly having no prevision she would not recross the Channel for
"four years and four months, and not see Dover again for five or six"
years.
British war vessels were off the port and inside it. But there was
not much excitement or crowding on the Ostende steamer or any of
"those sensational precautions against being torpedoed or mined,"
which soon afterwards oppressed the spirits of cross-Channel
passengers. Vessels arriving from Belgium were full of passengers of
"the superior refugee class, American and British tourists, or"
wealthy people who though they preferred living abroad had begun to
think that the Continent just now was not very healthy and England
the securest refuge for those who wished to be comfortable.
"Vivie being a good sailor and economical by nature, never thought of"
securing a cabin for the four or five hours' sea-journey. She sat on
the upper deck with her scanty luggage round her. A nice-looking
"young man who had a cabin the door of which he locked, was walking"
up and down on the level deck and scrutinizing her discreetly. And
when at last they worked their way backwards into Ostende--the
"harbour was full of vessels, chiefly mine-dredgers and torpedo"
boats--she noticed the obsequiousness of the steamer people and how
he left the ship before any one else.
"She followed soon afterwards, having little encumbrances in the way"
of luggage; but she observed that he just showed a glimpse of some
paper and was allowed to walk straight through the Douane with
"unexamined luggage, and so, on to the Brussels train."
But she herself had little difficulty. She put her hand luggage--she
"had no other--into a first-class compartment, and having an hour and"
a half to wait walked out to look at Ostende.
"men here, not even your chief assistant or Trehayne, should know that"
you are joining the _Malplaquet_ as a Marine. Two independent strings
"are in this case better than a double-jointed string."""
"""I never tell anything to any one, least of all to Pudden-Headed"
"Wilson. He is loyal, but a stupid ass with a flapping tongue. Trehayne"
"is close as wax, but, on general principles, I keep my movements"
"strictly to myself. He will be in the ship, but he won't know that I"
"am there too. The Commander must know and the Major of Marines, for I"
"shall want a uniform and the free run of the ship, so as to be posted"
"where I like. The Marine Sergeants of the Guard may guess, but, as Mr."
"Cary says, they won't talk. You two gentlemen are safe,"" added Dawson"
"pleasantly, ""for I've got you tight in my hand and could lock either"
"of you up in a minute if I chose."""
"A peculiar knock came upon the door, a word passed between Dawson and"
"the police sentry outside, and a young man in the uniform of a naval"
"petty officer entered the room. He was clean-shaven, looked about"
"twenty-five years old, was dark and slim of the Latin type which is"
"not uncommon in Cornwall, and impressed me at once with his air of"
"intelligence and refinement. His voice, too, was rather striking. It"
was that of the wardroom rather than of the mess deck. I liked the
look of Petty Officer Trehayne. Dawson presented him to us and then
"took him aside for instructions. When he had finished, both men"
"rejoined us, and the conversation became light and general. Trehayne,"
though clearly suffering from nervous strain after his recent
"professional failures, talked with the ease and detachment of a highly"
cultivated man. It appeared that he had been educated at Blundell's
"School, had lost his parents at about sixteen, had done a course in"
"some electrical engineering shops at Plymouth, and when twenty years"
old had secured a good berth on the engineering staff of the _Vernon_.
"He could speak both French and German, which he had learned partly at"
It was rather comical to see it. We were always climbing. And the line
"curved in great loops. So that as one looked out of the window, time and"
"again one started, seeing a little train running in front of us, in a"
"diverging direction, making big puffs of steam. But lo, it was our own"
little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead. We were quite a long
"train, but all trucks in front, only our two passenger coaches hitched"
on behind. And for this reason our own engine was always running fussily
"into sight, like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us,"
while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks.
I was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep
"slopes, how bravely it emerged on the sky-line. It is a queer railway. I"
would like to know who made it. It pelts up hill and down dale and round
"sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion, not as proper big railways"
"do, grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through"
"tunnels, but running up the hill like a panting, small dog, and having a"
"look round, and starting off in another direction, whisking us behind"
unconcernedly. This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.
They told me that Sardinia mines her own coal: and quite enough for her
"own needs: but very soft, not fit for steam-purposes. I saw heaps of it:"
"small, dull, dirty-looking stuff. Truck-loads of it too. And"
truck-loads of grain.
"At every station we were left ignominiously planted, while the little"
engines--they had gay gold names on their black little bodies--strolled
"about along the side-lines, and snuffed at the various trucks. There we"
"sat, at every station, while some truck was discarded and some other"
"sorted out like a branded sheep, from the sidings and hitched on to us."
"It took a long time, this did."
The man who was chosen by Cabrera to accompany them on their mission was
"of a most remarkable appearance. Tall, almost as tall as El Sarria, he"
was yet distinguished from his fellows by a notable gauntness and
angularity of figure.
"""A step-ladder with the bottom bars missing!"" was Rollo's mental"
"description of him, as he stood before them in a uniform jacket much too"
"tight for him, through which his ribs showed not unlike the spars of a"
ladder.
But in other respects Sergeant Cardono was a remarkable man. The iron
"gravity of his countenance, seamed on the right-hand side by a deep"
"scar, took no new expression when he found himself detailed by his"
general for this new and dangerous mission.
With a single salute he fell out and instantly attached himself to
"Rollo, whom he relieved of his knapsack and waterbottle on the spot."
"Sergeant Cardono paid no attention whatever to the other three, whom he"
evidently regarded as very subordinate members of the expedition.
As soon as they arrived at the village where they were to part from the
"command of Cabrera, Sergeant Cardono promptly disappeared. He was not"
"seen for several hours, during which Rollo and El Sarria wandered here"
and there endeavouring in that poor place to pick up some sustenance
which would serve them in lieu of a dinner. They had but poor success. A
"round of black bread, a fowl of amazing age, vitality, and muscular"
"development, with a few snails, were all that they could obtain by their"
"best persuasions, aided by the money with which Rollo was plentifully"
supplied. John Mortimer looked disconsolately on. He had added a little
"ham on his own account, which last he had brought in his saddle-bags"
"from the venta of Sarria. But everything pointed to a sparse meal, and"
even the philosophic Etienne shrugged his shoulders and departed to
"village. She assured the king that he was loyal and good, and would do"
no evil.
"The king was rather abashed that his design had been discovered, but he"
was firm in his purpose. He assured the queen that the blacksmith should
"come to no harm, but rather good; and he ordered the queen to obey him,"
threatening her that if she refused he would be sure that she was
"disloyal also, and there would be no alternative but to send and arrest"
"the blacksmith by force, and punish her, the queen, too. Then the queen"
said that if the king swore to her that her brother should come to no
"harm, she would write as ordered. _And the king swore._"
"So the queen wrote to her brother, and adjured him by his love to her to"
"come down to the Golden City. She said she had dire need of him, and she"
told him that the king had sworn that no harm should come to him.
The letter was sent off by a king's messenger. In due time the
"blacksmith arrived, and he was immediately seized and thrown into prison"
to await his trial.
"When the queen saw that she had been deceived, she was in despair. She"
"tried by every way, by tears and entreaties and caresses, to move the"
"king, but all without avail. Then she tried by plotting and bribery to"
"gain her brother's release, but it was all in vain. The day for trial"
"came quickly, and the blacksmith was tried, and he was condemned and"
sentenced to be burnt alive by the river on the following day.
On the evening of the day of trial the queen sent a message to the king
"to come to her; and when the king came reluctantly, fearing a renewal of"
"entreaties, expecting a woman made of tears and sobs, full of grief, he"
found instead that the queen had dried her eyes and dressed herself
"still more beautifully than ever, till she seemed to the king the very"
The great vaults of the Abbey of Farfa resounded with glee and
merriment.
"Before a low, massive stone table, resembling a druidical altar,"
"surrounded by giant casks filled with the choicest wines of Italy,"
"Greece and Spain, there sat the Duke of Spoleto and the Abbot"
"Hilarius, discoursing largely upon the vanities of the world, and"
touching incidentally upon questions pertaining to the welfare of
Church and State. A single cresset shed an unsteady light over the
"twain, while a lean, cadaverous friar glided noiselessly in and out"
"the transepts, obsequiously replenishing the beverage as it"
disappeared with astounding swiftness in the feasters' capacious
"stomachs. And each time he replenished the vessels, he refilled his"
"own with grim impartiality, watching the Abbot and his guest from a"
low settle in a dark recess.
The vault was of singular construction and considerable extent. The
roof was of solid stone masonry and rose in a wide semicircular arch
"to the height of about twelve feet, measured from the centre of the"
ceiling to the ground floor.
"The transepts were divided by obtusely pointed arches, resting on"
"slender granite pillars, and the intervening space was filled up with"
drinking vessels of every conceivable shape and size.
"The Abbot of Farfa was a discriminating drinker, boasting of an"
"ancestral thirst of uncommonly high degree, the legacy of a Teutonic"
ancestor who had served the Church with much credit in his time.
They had been carousing since sunset.
"no designs against Gatepath, yet she could not forbear to triumph over"
"him. ""One never knows,"" she said, ""when one may need a devoted friend,"
"and need him badly. I always look forward."""
Two or three weeks later Madame found a letter at her club signed
"""Gatepaths."" It was the club in Dover Street with those steep steps down"
which the members tumble helplessly in frosty weather. Madame calls it
"""The Club of Falling Women."""
"It appears that Gatepath, hunting for an adviser of ripe wisdom, had"
"sought out the Chief of Dawson and lately of Madame, and laid bare his"
pressing troubles. The Chief is one of those rare men to whom all his
"friends, and they are as the stars in number, go seeking counsel in"
"their crimes and follies. Nothing shocks him, nothing surprises him. And"
"from the depths of his wise, humorous, sympathetic mind, he will almost"
"always draw waters of comfort. Suppose, for example, one had slain a man"
and urgently sought to dispose of the corpse--a not uncommon problem in
crowded cities--to whom could one more profitably turn than to the
"Chief of His Majesty's Detective Service? Or if, in a passing fit of"
"absence of mind, one had wedded three wives, and the junior in rank"
began to suspect the existence of one or more seniors; do we not all
suffer from lapses of memory? One does not put these problems before the
"Chief as one's own--there is a decent convention in these matters--but,"
"of course, he knows. To know all is to pardon all, and there is very"
little that the Chief does not know about you or me.
The family solicitor of peers and princes poured into the Chief's ear
the fantastic cause of his present distresses. He delivered himself of
"the story in all seriousness, for it was dreadfully serious to him."
"Never in all his experience, and in that of his century-old firm, had"
anything so dreadfully serious occurred. The Chief controlled himself
"until the end was reached, and then exploded in a yell of laughter."
"""I don't believe he will,"" I observed, laughing. ""There will be a sham"
Dawson in the office and the genuine article will be out on the
"rampage. He is a man who couldn't sit still, not even if you tied him"
"in his chair and sealed the knots."""
We spent a pleasant hour pulling Dawson to pieces and leaving to him
"not a rag of virtue, except intense professional zeal. We exchanged"
"experiences of him, those of the chief assistant being particularly"
rich and highly flavoured. It appeared that Dawson when off duty loved
to occupy the platform at meetings of his religious connection and to
"hold forth to the elect. The privilege of ""sitting under him"" had been"
"enjoyed more than once by the assistant, who retailed to us extracts"
"from Dawson's favourite sermon on ""Truth."" His views upon Truth were"
"unbending as armour plate. ""Under no circumstances, not to save"
"oneself from imminent death, not to shield a wife or a child from the"
"penalties for a lapse from virtue, not even to preserve one's country"
"from the attacks of an enemy, was it permissible to a Peculiar Baptist"
to diverge by the breadth of a hair from the straight path of Truth.
Hell yawned on either hand; only along the knife edge of Truth could
"salvation be reached."""
"""He made me shiver,"" said the chief assistant, ""and he drove me to"
thinking of one or two little deceptions of my own. When Dawson
"preaches, his eyes blaze, his voice breaks, and he will fall on his"
knees and pray for the souls of those who heed not his words. You
can't look at him then and not believe that he means every word he
"says. Yet it's all humbug."""
"""No, it is not,"" said I. ""Dawson in the pulpit, or on the tub--or"
whatever platform he uses--is absolutely genuine. He is the finest
example that I have ever met of the dual personality. He is in dead
by melting bits of lead. With his primitive weapon with the entreaties
of his villagers ringing in his ears Kaloo Singh started on his perilous
journey. At midday I was startled by the groanings of some animals in
pain. The tigress had sprung among a herd of buffalo and with successive
strokes of its mighty paws had killed two buffaloes and left them in the
field. Kaloo Singh waited there for the return of the tigress to the
kill. There was not a tree near by; only there was a low bush behind
which he lay crouched. After hours of waiting as the sun was going down
he was taken aback by the sudden apparition of the tigress which stood
within six feet of him. His limbs had become half paralysed from cold
and his crouching position. Trying to raise his gun he could take no aim
as his arm was shaking with involuntary fear. Kaloo Singh explained to
"me afterwards how he succeeded in shaking off his mortal terror. ""I"
"quietly said to myself, Kaloo Singh, Kaloo Singh, who sent you here? Did"
not the villagers put their trust on you! I could then no longer lie in
"hiding, and I stood up and something strange and invigorating crept up"
strength into my body. All the trembling went and I became as hard as
steel. The tigress had seen me and with eyes blazing crouched for the
spring lashing its tail. Only six feet lay between. She sprang and my
gun also went off at the same time and she missed her aim and fell dead
"close to me."" That was how a common villager went off to meet death at"
the call of something for which he could give no name and the mother
and wife of Kaloo Singh had also bidden him go. There are millions of
Kaloo Singhs with mother and sisters and wife to send them forth. And
you too have many loved ones who would themselves bid you arm for the
defence of your homes.
DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT
"The issue is clear, and immediate action is imperative. But action is"
delayed by misunderstanding arising out of temperamental differences
"and, according to instructions, looked the accountant officer"
"squarely in the face and gave his name and rating. Then, receiving"
"his money in the crown of his cap, the recipient saluted and moved"
away to make room for the next man.
All was proceeding smoothly and with the regularity of clockwork when
suddenly a diversion occurred.
The ship's company had a mascot in the shape of a young African
"monkey, that had been presented to the ""Sunderland"" by a French"
cruiser during a visit to an Algerian port. Although usually
"good-tempered ""Mephisto"" could and did exhibit fits of sulkiness and"
outbursts of insubordination that would have earned a lower deck man
"ninety days' ""confined to detention quarters."" But the monkey being a"
"sort of chartered libertine, was idolized by the ship's company and"
mildly tolerated by the officers.
Mephisto was lazily sunning himself under the lee of the quarter-deck
6-in gun shield when his eye caught sight of the chief writer's
"silver watch, which that petty officer had occasion to consult."
Probably the monkey imagined that it was one of the tins of condensed
milk for which he had great partiality.
"Getting on his four feet Mephisto ambled across the quarter-deck,"
past the line of men drawn up at attention. Before he could cross the
"chalk line, a symbol for which he had no respect, the chief writer"
had replaced his timepiece.
Foiled in that direction the monkey made a grab at a pile of brand
"new copper coins, and before any of the officers and men could"
"prevent, had made a rush for the weather-shrouds."
"The natives of Sinaketa, as we have seen in the last chapter, acquire"
"a certain amount of the Koya produce by means of trade. There are,"
"however, certain articles, useful yet unobtainable in the Trobriands,"
"and freely accessible in the Koya, and to these the Trobrianders"
"help themselves. The glassy forms of lava, known as obsidian, can be"
found in great quantities over the slopes of the hills in Sanaroa
"and Dobu. This article, in olden days, served the Trobrianders"
"as material for razors, scrapers, and sharp, delicate, cutting"
instruments. Pumice-stone abounding in this district is collected
"and carried to the Trobriands, where it is used for polishing. Red"
"ochre is also procured there by the visitors, and so are the hard,"
basaltic stones (binabina) used for hammering and pounding and for
"magical purposes. Finally, very fine silica sand, called maya, is"
"collected on some of the beaches, and imported into the Trobriands,"
"where it is used for polishing stone blades, of the kind which serve"
as tokens of value and which are manufactured up to the present day.
II
But by far the most important of the articles which the Trobrianders
"collect for themselves are the spondylus shells. These are freely,"
"though by no means easily, accessible in the coral outcrops of Sanaroa"
Lagoon. It is from this shell that the small circular perforated
"discs (kaloma) are made, out of which the necklaces of the Kula"
"are composed, and which also serve for ornamenting almost all the"
articles of value or of artistic finish which are used within the
"Kula district. But, only in two localities within the district are"
"these discs manufactured, in Sinaketa and in Vakuta, both villages in"
"Southern Boyowa. The shell can be found also in the Trobriand Lagoon,"
In any case if India need to make any contribution to the world it
should be as great as the hope they cherished for her. Let them not
"talk of the glories of the past till they have secured for her, her true"
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Let them find out how
she had fallen from her high estate and ruthlessly put an end to all
that self satisfied and little-minded vanity which had been the cause of
their fatal weakness. What was it that stood in her way? Was her mind
paralysed by weak superstitious fears? That was not so; for her great
"thinkers, the Rishis, always stood for freedom of intellect and while"
"Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno burnt for their opinions, they boldly"
declared that even the Vedas were to be rejected if they did not conform
to truth. They urged in favour of persistent efforts for the discovery
"of physical causes yet unknown, since to them nothing was extra-physical"
but merely mysterious because of a hitherto unascertained cause. Were
they afraid that the march of knowledge was dangerous to true faith? Not
so. For their knowledge and religion were one.
These are the hopes that animate us. For there is something in the Hindu
culture which is possessed of extraordinary latent strength by which it
has resisted the ravages of time and the destructive changes which have
swept over the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure through infinite
transformations must be innate in that mighty civilisation which has
"seen the intellectual culture of the Nile Valley, of Assyria and of"
Babylon war and wane and disappear and which to-day gazes on the future
with the same invincible faith with which it met the past.

"If it is a double foetus with five feet, serious hostility in the"

It will be observed that in quite a number of cases two alternative

an unofficial character bearing on the welfare of the individual to whom
the mother lamb that had produced the monstrosity belonged. One foetus

"favorable or an unfavorable sign, according to the position of the second."
"If the one lay above the other, the association of ideas pointed to a"

ideas leading to the interpretation is not clear; and we must perhaps
assume in such instances an entry of an event that =actually= occurred
after the birth of the monstrosity in question. A certain measure of
arbitrariness in the interpretations also constitutes a factor to be taken
into consideration; and the last thing that we need to expect in any

The new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its
"jealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very"
many of the executive functions of government. The results were
"disastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the"
"army was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the"
"gulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,"
"the revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about"
"to overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local"
"self-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into"
factions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by
organized massacres.

We know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte
by the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to
show that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his
plans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.
"In September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the"
hopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French
National Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts
"his compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a"
speedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new
"tricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;"
"to form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young"
"officer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now"
"honeycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was"
Corsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica
"intervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard is dispersed."
Thereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny
between the Governing Class and the People. Curiously enough the
respective responsive characteristics of the Anglo Saxon and the Indians
are paralleled by the two types of responses seen in all living matter.
In the one type the response is slow but proportionate to the stimulus
that excites it. The response grows with the strength of external force.
In the other it is quite different--here it is an all-or-none principle.
It either responds to the utmost or nothing at all. This is also
illustrated in the different racial characteristics. The Anglo Saxon has
"even by his rights by struggle, step by step. The insignificant little"
"has, by accumulation, became large, and which has been gained, has been"
gained for all time. But in the Indian the ideal and the emotional are
"the only effective stimulus. The ideal of his King is Rama, who"
renounced his kingdom and even his beloved for an idea. One day a king
and another day a bare-footed wanderer in the forest! Who cares? All or
nothing!
The concessions made by a modern form of Government safeguarded by
necessary limitations may appear almost as grudging gifts. The Indian
wants something which comes with unhesitating frankness and warmth and
strikes his ideality and imagination. But ancient and modern kingship
are sometimes at one in direct and spontaneous pronouncement of the
royal sympathy. Such was the Proclamation of Queen Victoria which
stirred to its depths the popular heart.
"""In the Prosperity of Our subjects will be our strength, in their"
"contentment Our security, in their Gratitude Our best Reward."""
That there are increasingly frequent reflexes in our Government to
popular needs and wishes is happily illustrated at a most opportune
moment from the statements in the recent _Gazette of India_ and cables
received from London. In the former we find that the Viceroy and his
council had recommended the abolition of the system of indentured

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The physical history of the period is recorded
in the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper
"Cambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which"
gradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior
of North America. The limestones of the early and middle
Ordovician show that now the shore had become remote and the lands
had become more low. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of
brachiopods and other lime-secreting animals occupied the sea
"bottom, and their debris mantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The"
sandy limestones of the Calciferous record the transition stage
from the Cambrian when some sand was still brought in from shore.
The highly fossiliferous limestones of the Trenton tell of clear
water and abundant life. We need not regard this epicontinental
"sea as deep. No abysmal deposits have been found, and the"
"limestones of the period are those which would be laid in clear,"
warm water of moderate depth like that of modern coral seas.
The shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea
now became clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land
"was gradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those"
"periodic crises which, as we may imagine, have taken place"
whenever the crust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way
"over its great depressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters"
into deepening abysses. The land was thus left relatively higher
and bordered with new coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was
"shoaled and narrowed, and muds were washed in from the adjacent"
lands.
THE TACONIC DEFORMATION. The Ordovician was closed by a
deformation whose extent and severity are not yet known. From the
"St. Lawrence River to New York Bay, along the northwestern and"
"western border of New England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician"
the one or the other.  But yet he must break away.  Pacing up and down
"the room, he seemed to see the soft earnest eyes of the Lady Geraldine"
"bent upon him.  He had pledged his word to her, and in spirit to his"
dead mother.  From that pledge there was no drawing back.  Yet how could
the break best be made?
He thought over the engagements already entered into.  Was it needful
that these should be kept? He thought not—at least not those which were
but promises to meet at such and such clubs or coffee-houses for the
purposes of card-playing and similar recreations.  But there was one
engagement that Grey did not see his way honourably to break. He had
promised to ride Don Carlos the following Saturday in a course against
"three other picked horses, and heavy wagers, he knew, had been laid upon"
or against his steed.  This engagement he felt he could not break; but
the rest he would.  He might even make the excuse that Don Carlos wanted
"attention, and that he was going to take him into the country for"
"purposes of training; and, once away from Sandford House, he ought to be"
"able to pen a letter to the master which might excuse his return, and"
explain the nature of the change which had come over him.
"Yes, that would be the way.  He would not go open-mouthed to him this"
"morning, to be perhaps scoffed or cajoled into some rash compromise."
Grey knew that his ability to see both sides of a question often led him
into difficulties and the appearance of vacillation.  Surely he could
keep his pledge if he made the break with a certain diplomatic skill.
"Not only would it be easier to himself, but it might prove the safer"
method also.
"When he saw Lord Sandford in the midst of his friends, laughing at the"

"redoubtable Duchess of Marlborough to the meek Queen, discussing the"

[Illustration: A PERFECT BUNCH OF BANANAS]
The towns of Bocas del Toro and Almirante are maintained almost entirely
by the banana trade. Other companies than the United Fruit raise and buy
"bananas here, but it was the initiative of the leading company which by"
systematic work put the prosperity of this section on a firm basis.
Lands that a few years ago were miasmatic swamps are now improved and
"planted with bananas. Over 4,000,000 bunches were exported from this"
"plantation in 1911, and 35,000 acres are under cultivation there. A"
narrow gauge railway carries bananas exclusively. The great white
steamships sail almost daily carrying away little except bananas. The
money spent over the counters of the stores in Bocas del Toro comes from
natives who have no way of getting money except by raising bananas and
"selling them, mostly to the United Fruit Company. It has its"
"competitors, but it invented the business and has brought it to its"
"highest development. At this Panama town, and for that matter in the"
"other territories it controls, the company has established and enforces"
the sanitary reforms which Col. Gorgas applied so effectively in Colon
and Panama. Its officials proudly claim that they were the pioneers in
inventing and applying the methods which have conquered tropical
diseases. At Bocas del Toro the company maintains a hospital which lacks
"nothing of the equipment of the Ancon Hospital, though of course not so"
large. It has successfully adopted the commissary system established on
the Canal Zone. Labor has always been the troublesome factor in
industrial enterprises in Central America. The Fruit Company has joined
with the Isthmian Commission in the systematic endeavor to keep labor
contented and therefore efficient.
[Illustration: THE ASTOR YACHT AT CRISTOBAL]
Probably it will be the policy which any corporation attempting to do
"pistol from his belt, looked carefully to the priming, and with the"
greatest coolness in the world pointed it at the misshapen brat.
"""Now listen,"" he said, ""you are old enough to know the meaning of words;"
I give you one minute to betake yourself to your own place and leave us
"alone! There is no contagion in a pistol bullet, my fine lad, but it is"
quite as deadly as any plague. So be off before a charge of powder
"catches you up!"""
"The sound of the angry voices had attracted La Giralda, who, looking up"
hastily from her task of building the fire beneath the gipsy tripod at
"which she and the Sergeant were cooking, advanced hastily with a long"
wand in her hand.
"The imp wheeled about as on a pivot, and positively appeared to shrink"
"into his clothing at the sight of her. He stood motionless, however,"
while La Giralda advanced threateningly towards him with the wand in her
hand as if for the purpose of castigation. As she approached he emitted
"a cry of purely animal terror, and hastily whipping his crutch under his"
"arm, betook himself, in a series of long hops, to a spot twenty yards"
higher up the bank. But La Giralda stopped him by a word or two spoken
"in an unknown tongue, harsh-sounding as Catalan, but curt and brief as a"
military order.
"The boy stood still and answered in the same speech, at first gruffly"
"and unwillingly, with downcast looks and his bare great toe scrabbling"
in the dust of the hillside.
"The dialogue lasted for some time, till at last with a scornful gesture"
"La Giralda released him, pointing to the upper edge of the _barranco_ as"
the place by which he was to disappear: the which he was now as eager to
"do, as he had formerly been insolently determined to remain."
"altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the"
arch though resolute curve of her lips.
A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near
which she sat. Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight
"of the young lady, the man’s face changed to red and back to pale"
"again. He watched her countenance as he drew nearer, with hope and"
"anxiety mingled on his own. He passed within a few yards of her, but he"
saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence.
Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at
one side. The boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with
"wondering, shrewd eyes. The young man took out his handkerchief and"
"wiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young"
man was good to look at. He said to the boy:
“I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell
"her I am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I"
"shall join that Alaska moose-hunting expedition. Tell her that, since"
"she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I take this"
"means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake"
of what has been. Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not
"deserved such treatment, without giving him her reasons or a chance to"
explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to be. Tell her that
"I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the"
"hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her"
that.”
The young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy’s hand. The boy looked
"at him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent"
"face, and then set off at a run. He approached the lady on the bench a"
"little doubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the brim of the old"
"enlarged, the stall of the enemy will be diminished."
"If the outside of the right ear is destroyed, the land will yield to"
the enemy's land.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the cheek[58], the enemy"
"will prevail against the power of the king, the king will be without"
"counsellors, a ruler will not inhabit the land, or the son of the"
king of universal sway[59] will be king.
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the cheek, an enemy will be"
installed in the royal palace.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a"
"demon[60] in my land, or in the house of the man[61]."
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a demon in"
"the enemy's land, or the land of the enemy will perish."
The guiding principle of the interpretation in these instances is the
natural association of the right as your side and the left with the
"enemy's side. A defect on the right side is unfavorable to you, i. e., to"
the king or to the country or to the individual in whose household the
"birth occurs, while the same defect on the left side is unfavorable to the"
"enemy and, therefore, favorable to you. The principle is quite"
consistently carried out even to the point that if the sign itself is
"favorable, it is only when it is found on the right side that it is"
"favorable to you, while its occurrence on the left side is favorable to"
the enemy.
"Defects of any kind appear to be unfavorable, whereas an excess of organs"
"and parts are in many instances favorable, though with a considerable"

My first visit in Robat was to the officer who had been commanding
"the scattered British forces up to that date. He was a very sick man,"
and had been holding out with the utmost difficulty until he could be
"relieved. Here I met Major Landon of the 35th Scinde Horse, one of"
the three Intelligence Officers employed by the Indian Government in
Persia.
I very quickly realised that Landon was an officer of very high
"intelligence, as well as an Intelligence Officer, and that he had a"
"fund of information concerning the country, and the conditions and"
characteristics of the inhabitants of both Persia and Baluchistan. In
"fact, I judged that he would be such an asset that, then and there, I"
"invited him to become my Brigade-Major, although I ruefully remarked"
"that I had, at present, no brigade!"
"He was keen to accept, but did not know how the authorities at Simla"
"would view his acceptance of such a post, and asked me whether I"
should be willing to shoulder the responsibility of annexing him for
"the campaign. Considering that my shoulders were broad enough, I"
promptly replied that my orders had been to take command of all the
"scattered forces I could find and co-ordinate them, and that I looked"
"upon him as my second ""find,"" Idu and his two companions being the"
"first. Further, that he was here as Intelligence Officer and would"
"jealousy swept over him; and when I told him of my resolution, I trow"
"that his suspicions received confirmation.  I did not see it then, but I"
"see it now.  He thought I left him to pursue my ends alone, and,"
"perchance, to seek to win the lady of his choice.  But he spoke nothing"
"of this—only insisted that for this week my engagements should be kept,"
"and that after to-day’s race I might go my own way, an I was so"
resolved.  He was not unkindly; yet there was something strange and
"stern in his bearing and language, and you have seen how his imperious"
temper and will sweep all before them.  I myself was strangely dazed and
something sorrowful.  I scarce do know why my heart was so heavy within
me.  I let him have his way; and you behold what that way has been.  I
"am a ruined man, beggared of all my winnings; and methinks my Lord"
"Sandford has plotted for this very thing."""
"""It is a shame!  Would I could take my horsewhip to him—"""
"""Nay, nay, good Dicon; be not so wroth,"" spoke Grey calmly and quietly."
"""In sooth, I know not that I owe him aught but thanks.  When all is said"
"and done, it was but ill-gotten gain.  I would sooner face life with"
"none of it upon me.  I had a few guineas to start with—well, it was more"
"than a few; yet had I spent my time in London, I should have had but"
"little left by now.  I have learned many lessons, and I shall start"
"clear of debt, and without my pockets filled with other men’s gold."""
Dick was scarce moralist enough to understand or appreciate his master’s
"scruples—scruples new, indeed, to Grey himself—but the faithful fellow"
was ready to accept any verdict and any decision made by the man he
loved and served; and as he put the finishing touches to the workmanlike
"riding toilet which he had in readiness, he remarked with a short"
"laugh,—"
"""Faith, master, you and I betwixt us, with Don Carlos and my good nag"
"found the Guaymies, the only primitive people living in large numbers"
"outside the Darien. There are about 5000 of them, living for the most"
"part in the valley of Mirando which lies high up in the Cordilleras, and"
in a region cut off from the plains. Here they have successfully
defended their independence against the assaults of both whites and
blacks. To remain in their country without consent of the Great Chief is
"practically impossible, for they are savage fighters and in earlier days"
it was rare to see a man whose body was not covered with scars. It is
apparent that in some ways progress has destroyed their industries and
"made the people less rather than more civilized, for they now buy cloth,"
"arms, tools, and utensils which they were once able to make. At one time"
"they were much under the influence of the Catholic missionaries, but of"
late mission work has languished in wild Panama and perhaps the chief
relic of that earlier religious influence is the fact that the women go
"clothed in a single garment. This simple raiment, not needed for warmth,"
"seems to be prized, for if caught in a rainstorm the women will quickly"
"strip off their clothing, wrap it in a large banana or palm leaf that it"
"may not get wet, and continue their work, or their play, in nature’s"
garb.
"It is said, too, that when strangers are not near clothes are never"
"thought of. The men follow a like custom, and invariably when pursuing a"
"quarry strip off their trousers, tying their shirts about their loins."
"Trousers seem to impede their movements, and if a lone traveler in"
Chiriqui comes on a row of blue cotton trousers tied to the bushes he
may be sure that a band of Guaymies is somewhere in the neighborhood
pursuing an ant bear or a deer.

"""Yes, and I own everything in the village,"" asserted the imp. ""If you"
"want anything here you must pay me for it!"""
The Sergeant found it even as the cripple had said. There was not a
single living inhabitant in the village. Here and there a shut door and
a sickening smell betrayed the fact that some unfortunates had been left
to die untended. Etienne and John Mortimer were for different reasons
"unwilling to taste of the ham and bread he had brought back, thinking"
"that these might convey the contagion, but La Giralda and the Sergeant"
"laughed their fears to scorn, and together retired to prepare the"
evening meal.
"As the others made their preparations for the night, watering their"
"beasts and grooming them with the utmost care, the little crook-backed"
"imp from the village appeared on the brink of the _barranco_, his"
"sallow, weazened face peeping suspiciously out of the underbrush, and"
his crutch performing the most curious evolutions in the air.
There was something unspeakably eerie in the aspect of the solitary
"survivor of so many living people, left behind to prey like a ghoul on"
the abandoned possessions of the fear-stricken living and the
untestamented property of the dead.
"Concha shrank instinctively from his approach, and the boy, perceiving"
"his power over her, came scuttling like a weasel through the brushwood,"
till little more than a couple of paces interposed between him and the
"girl. Frozen stiff with loathing and terror, it was not for some time"
"that Concha could cry out and look round hastily for Rollo, who"
(doubtless in his capacity of leader of the expedition) was not slow in
hastening to her assistance.
"Hurrying on, Bob presently caught up with a throng of his own men, who"
"had apparently just landed from the dangerous, constantly shifting"
"surface of the river. They looked at him with a frank curiosity, as if"
wondering what he meant to do in this emergency. On the faces of a few
"were expressions of grim, anticipatory amusement, but Bainbridge heeded"
these no more than he had the others. Without pausing even glancing to
"right or left, he strode on, and reached the scene of action."
"On the same bank, a little way back from the water, stood a small"
"building, so hastily thrown together that the roof was not yet"
"completed. One or two men were standing near it, staring interestedly at"
the crowd gathered about something at the water’s edge which Bob at once
"saw to be one end of a massive, well-constructed log boom. The other"
"end, out beyond the middle of the river, was supported by some stout"
"spiles, and the whole affair took up so much of the stream’s width that"
Bainbridge’s drive had jammed against it hard and fast.
All this Bob took in without slackening his pace. Reaching the outer
"edge of the circle, he pushed through to where Jack Peters, his jam"
"boss, stood facing a compact group of six or eight strangers, gathered"
"closely about the end of the boom, Jack was florid with rage, and"
choking with impotent fury. The strangers composing the little group
instantly struck Bob as being singularly strong and rugged. They looked
as if they had been picked for their physical efficiency. Each one was
"armed with rifle or pistol, while their leader, a competent-looking"
"person with red hair and whiskers, held in one hand a snub-nosed,"
businesslike automatic.
"“Well, Jack,” Bainbridge said curtly, as he reached the foreman’s side,"
“what’s the trouble?”
Have the overhand: in me it is verified.
"Pray for me, good people, I beseech you heartily,"
That the Lord above on my poor soul have mercy.
"Farewell noblemen, with the clergy spiritual,"
"Farewell men of law, with the whole commonalty."
"Your disobedience I do forgive you all,"
And desire God to pardon your iniquity.
"Farewell, sweet England, now last of all to thee:"
I am right sorry I could do for thee no more.
"Farewell once again, yea, farewell for evermore."
"Prompted by a different motive, yet not far removed in actual effect"
"from the politico-religious class of play represented by _New Custom_,"
are the early Interludes of John Heywood. It is quite impossible to read
such a play as _The Pardoner and the Friar_ and believe that its author
wrote under any such earnest and sober inspiration as did the author of
"_New Custom_. His intention was frankly to amuse, and to paint life as"
he saw it without the intrusion of unreal personages of highly virtuous
but dull ideas. Yet he swung the lash of satire as cuttingly and as
merrily about the flanks of ecclesiastical superstition as ever did the
creator of Perverse Doctrine.[47]
"The simplest plot sufficed Heywood, and the minimum of characters. _The"
Pardoner and the Friar_ (possibly as early as 1520) demands only four
"persons, while the plot may be summed up in a few sentences, thus: A"
"Pardoner and a Friar, from closely adjoining platforms, are endeavouring"
"to address the same crowd, the one to sell relics, the other to beg"
money for his order. By a sort of stichomythic alternation each for a
"time is supposed to carry on his speech regardless of the other, so that"
to follow either connectedly the alternate lines must be read in
"sequence. But every now and then they break off for abuse, and finally"
they fight. A Parson and neighbour Prat interfere to convey them to jail
seemed to them a fitting pretext to suppress the _bonae literae_. 'I
"have declared that you are perfectly unknown to me, that I have not yet"
read your books and therefore neither approve nor disapprove anything.'
"'I reserve myself, so far as I may, to be of use to the reviving"
studies. Discreet moderation seems likely to bring better progress than
impetuosity. It was by this that Christ subjugated the world.'
"On the same day he writes to John Lang, one of Luther's friends and"
"followers, a short note, not meant for publication: 'I hope that the"
endeavours of yourself and your party will be successful. Here the
Papists rave violently.... All the best minds are rejoiced at Luther's
boldness: I do not doubt he will be careful that things do not end in a
quarrel of parties!... We shall never triumph over feigned Christians
"unless we first abolish the tyranny of the Roman see, and of its"
"satellites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans and the Carmelites. But no"
one could attempt that without a serious tumult.'
"As the gulf widens, Erasmus's protestations that he has nothing to do"
with Luther become much more frequent. Relations at Louvain grow ever
more disagreeable and the general sentiment about him ever more unkind.
In August 1519 he turns to the Pope himself for protection against his
opponents. He still fails to see how wide the breach is. He still takes
it all to be quarrels of scholars. King Henry of England and King
Francis of France in their own countries have imposed silence upon the
quarrellers and slanderers; if only the Pope would do the same!
In October he was once more reconciled with the Louvain faculty. It was
"just at this time that Colet died in London, the man who had, better"
"perhaps than anyone else, understood Erasmus's standpoint. Kindred"
spirits in Germany still looked up to Erasmus as the great man who was
on the alert to interpose at the right moment and who had made
"moderation the watchword, until the time should come to give his friends"
"""It was all very simple,"" he went on, ""like most things in my business"
when one gets to the bottom of them. He was seduced by a man whom the
"local police have had on their string for a long time, but who will"
now be put securely away. Menteith was a frequenter of a certain
"public house down the river, where he posed as an authority on the"
"Navy, and hinted darkly at his stores of hidden information. Our"
"German agent made friends with him, gave him small sums for drinks,"
and flattered his vanity. It is strange how easily some men are
deceived by flattery. The agent got from Menteith one or two bits of
"news by pretending a disbelief in his sources of intelligence, and"
"then, when the fool had committed himself, threatened to denounce him"
"to the police unless he took service with him altogether. Money, of"
"course, passed, but not very much. The Germans who employ spies so"
extensively pay them extraordinarily little. They treat them like
"scurvy dogs, for whom any old bone is good enough, and I'm not sure"
they are not right. They go on the principle that the white trash who
will sell their country need only to be paid with kicks and coppers.
Menteith swears that he did not receive more than four pounds for the
plans and description of the _Rampagious_. Fancy selling one's country
and risking one's neck for four measly pounds sterling! If he had got
"four thousand, I should have had some respect for him. His home is in"
"a wretched state, and his wife--a pretty woman, though almost a"
"skeleton, and a very nicely mannered, honest woman--says that her"
husband unexpectedly gave her four pounds a month ago. He had kept
"none of the blood money for drink! Curious, isn't it?"""
"""It shows that the man had some good in him. It shows that he was"
ashamed to use the money upon himself. We must do something for the
"poor wife, Dawson."""
"""She will easily get work, and she will be far better without her sot"
of a husband. She did not cry when I told her everything. 'I ought to
"another, shaking the ground and reverberating, and sending up showers of"
"stones and loose earth that came rattling down on to the canteen-roof,"
"while the huddled, sprawling mass of human bodies shook and squirmed"
"with terror. The droning of propellers could be plainly heard, then it"
"grew weaker and weaker, until it passed away. One by one the men got up."
"Someone lit a candle. Tables, benches, and prostrate bodies had been"
thrown into confusion. Cards and coins and overturned beer-mugs littered
the floor. The smell of spilt beer mingled with the smell of stale
tobacco. A few of us stepped out into the open air. We inhaled a
"pungent, sulphurous stench. We were sure our camp had been bombed this"
time and were fearful lest any of our friends had been hit. We walked
past the Church tent--it was full of rents and holes. And just beyond it
was a huge pit with fresh soil heaped up in a ring around it. Loose
earth and stones and sods were scattered everywhere. Then we saw
"something move in the darkness--it was a man on all fours, dragging"
himself painfully along and uttering a groan with every breath. Two
bearers arrived with a stretcher. They put it down by his side and
helped him on to it. Then they picked it up and disappeared in the
gloom. We had hardly walked a few yards further when we saw a light
approaching us. We went towards it. A man was staggering slowly along
and leaning on the shoulder of a comrade who was carrying a lantern. He
"supported his right elbow with his left hand, down the back of which"
two thin streams of blood were winding. His left sleeve was darkly
stained and the blood was dripping from it. His face was very pale and
the corners of his mouth were slightly turned down.
Suddenly the broad white beam of a searchlight swung across the
darkness. For a time it seemed to paw the sky in a hesitating fashion
and then it remained fixed on one spot.
"""There 'e is! There 'e is!"" someone shouted in an excited voice."
"her back. ""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant. ""O,"
"it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her"
"into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ""The boy"
"told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said"
"the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her"
"cat for four shillings. The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain"
was closed.
"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke"
"loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and"
did not know where or whither. At last he came to a land where he had
"never yet been, and went up into the city."
"In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay"
"a switch, one for each guest. This seemed strange to the merchant, for"
he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. Yet
"he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the"
"rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" Yes, and when the food"
"came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place"
"was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table"
"had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and"
"nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than"
"the other. Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they"
"had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ""How is it"
"the folk here have no cats?"" ""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know"
what they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the
"scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to"
"hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been"
able to eat in such comfort. Then they begged and implored the merchant
to sell them his cat. At last he said he would let them have her; but he
reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.
"Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the"
"strong, sweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of"
wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost
"seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: “What, dear?” as if"
"he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung"
"to him and wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his"
senses for the time confused and commingled. How could one be
"peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But,"
"was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?"
"“She has been in this room,” he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a"
"token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had"
belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of
"mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own—whence came"
it?
The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the
"flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins—those discreet,"
"indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of"
"mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their"
triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he
"came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his"
face. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the
"floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a"
"pawnbroker’s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of"
"dreams. In the last was a woman’s black satin hair bow, which halted"
"him, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is"
"femininity’s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales."
"And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the"
Of children such as this you may find any number. Only you have to look
"for them, as they are not brought forward spontaneously. The Burmese,"
"like other people, hate to have their beliefs and ideas ridiculed, and"
from experience they have learned that the object of a foreigner in
inquiring into their ways is usually to be able to show by his contempt
how very much cleverer a man he is than they are. Therefore they are
very shy. But once they understand that you only desire to learn and to
"see, and that you will always treat them with courtesy and"
"consideration, they will tell you all that they think."
"A fellow officer of mine has a Burmese police orderly, a young man about"
"twenty, who has been with him since he came to the district two years"
ago. Yet my friend only discovered accidentally the other day that his
orderly remembers his former life. He is very unwilling to talk about
"it. He was a woman apparently in that former life, and lived about"
"twenty miles away. He must have lived a good life, for it is a step of"
promotion to be a man in this life; but he will not talk of it. He
"forgets most of it, he says, though he remembered it when he was a"
child.
Sometimes this belief leads to lawsuits of a peculiarly difficult
"nature. In 1883, two years before the annexation of Upper Burma, there"
"was a case that came into the local Court of the oil district, which"
depended upon this theory of transmigration.
Opposite Yenangyaung there are many large islands in the river. These
"islands during the low water months are joined to the mainland, and are"
covered with a dense high grass in which many deer live.
"When the river rises, it rises rapidly, communication with the mainland"
"is cut off, and the islands are for a time, in the higher rises,"
entirely submerged. During the progress of the first rise some hunters
"“The note’s for ten thousand, so that’s all straightened out,”"
"Bainbridge murmured, with a snap of his fingers. “The money from the"
stock can go for current expenses. I’ll fix it up this very night.”
He did. Fortunately Tweedy held his power of attorney with the right to
"sign checks and execute papers of any sort, so it was possible for him"
to put through these deals without his returning to Bangor. That another
note for nearly as much as the first fell due in little more than a
"fortnight Bainbridge knew quite well. By that time, however, he fully"
"intended to have the drive down as far as their mill at Lancaster, fifty"
miles or so above Bangor. And it is always possible to raise money on
"timber, even in the rough."
"Of course, if the trust continued their campaign of cutting prices Bob’s"
"plans would be materially affected. He could not believe, however, that"
they would do such a thing for any great length of time. A dollar meant
"as much to them as to any one, and even the pleasure of ruining a"
competitor would scarcely compensate for the loss of so much money.
A long letter of instruction and explanation was written to Tweedy that
"night, and despatched the first thing in the morning by the trusty hand"
"of Joe Moose, the Indian. That off his mind, Bob returned to his drive"
"with renewed vigor, for the necessity for haste was now even greater"
than before. It was a question of getting the logs down in double-quick
time or being dragged into the bankruptcy court; and that sort of
notoriety did not appeal in the least to the young man.
It was this feeling of necessity which got Bob up next morning before
the blackness of the night was more than faintly tinged by streaks of
pale gray in the east. He wanted to be off and doing; even necessary
inaction chafed. It seemed an eternity before the men had finished
"narrow one in Harpe Alley, leading from Shoe Lane.  It was not an old"
"house, for it came within the area of the great fire of fifty years"
"back, and had been rebuilt, like the whole of the surrounding buildings,"
with greater speed than discretion.  Grey had once come across Sir
"Christopher Wren in his other life, and had talked with him of the"
short-sighted policy observed in the rebuilding of the city.  The great
"architect declared that had his plans been carried out, London would"
have been the finest city in the world: but the haste and false economy
"of the citizens and city companies had thwarted his plans, and the old"
"lines of narrow and crooked streets were kept as before, to the cost of"
succeeding generations.
"This house had been hastily run up, like those surrounding it, and the"
tempest from without rattled and shook the walls and windows as though
"to drive them in.  But the room itself, though no more than an attic,"
"bore an air of comfort very pleasant to the eyes of the homeless Grey,"
whose own quarters only contained the barest necessities of life; for
"there were some rough shelves full of books in one corner, and a rug"
before the fire gave a look of comfort to the place.  Two armchairs of
"rude pattern, but furnished with down cushions, seemed to invite repose;"
"and everything was scrupulously clean, even to the boards of the floor."
"""’A poor thing, but mine own,’"" spoke the Old Lion, with his grim smile,"
"as he motioned to Grey to take one chair, and he himself pulled up the"
"other. ""I have dwelt here two years and more now, and I have not been"
"unhappy; albeit I never thought to end my days in a garret, as belike I"
"shall do now."""
"""Fortune has been hard upon you,"" spoke Grey earnestly.  ""You have the"
gifts and the powers; it is cruel that your limbs should have become
"crippled."""
"I knew then, if never before, that there could be no happiness in this"
world for her away from him. Whether she would find it with him was
"impossible for me to know, but I saw that she was in the grip of a mighty"
"passion, and I could only hope that a way would open to save her."
Hamilton's fortunes would need to mend a great deal before he could
"or would ask her to be his wife, for now he was at the bottom of the"
ladder. He lost no opportunity to impress this disagreeable truth upon
"her, but his honest efforts to hold himself aloof only increased her"
respect and love for him. It not only convinced her that notwithstanding
"his past life, he was a man of honor capable of resisting himself and of"
"protecting her, but it gave him the quality so irresistible to a"
woman--unattainability.
"Taking it all in all, my poor beautiful cousin was falling day by"
day deeper into an abyss of love from which she could in no way
"extricate herself. In short, level-headed Frances had got far out"
"of plumb, and, though she struggled desperately, she could not right"
"herself, nor could any one help her. I fully realized that the small"
amount of self-restraint and passivity she still retained would give
way to disastrous activity when the time should come for her to part
with George and lose him forever. But I could see no way to save her
"unless I could induce George to leave England at once, for good and"
all.
"At times the fates seem to fly to a man's help, and in this instance they"
"came to me most graciously that same day in Whitehall, in the person of"
my friend the Count de Grammont.
"Soon after leaving Frances in the maids' apartments, I met that most"
"interesting gentleman roué, his Grace de Grammont, coming from the king's"
"closet. As already stated, he had been banished from the French court by"
with a view to checking internal hæmorrhage was used with good effect.
The wounds needed simple dressing only.
"The treatment of hæmothorax at a later date, however, was of much"
interest and difficulty. I think the following lines may be laid down
for guidance in such cases:--
"(i) Hæmothorax, even of considerable severity, will undergo spontaneous"
cure. An early rise of temperature may be disregarded.
(ii) Tapping the chest is indicated when pressure signs on the lung are
"sufficiently severe to cause serious symptoms, and the removal of the"
"blood undoubtedly shortens the period of recovery, as well as relieves"
symptoms.
In such cases the collection of blood has usually been rapid and
continuous; hence a fresh hæmorrhage is always probable when the local
pressure has been removed. Tapping therefore should not necessarily mean
"complete evacuation, and should be followed by careful firm binding up"
"of the chest, the administration of opium, and the most stringent"
precautions for rest.
"(iii) Tapping may be needed as a diagnostic aid, and in such"
circumstances as much fluid as can be removed should be evacuated with
the same precautions as mentioned in the last paragraph.
(iv) Tapping may be indicated for the evacuation of serum expressed from
"the blood-clot, or due to pleural effusion, on the same lines as in any"
other collection of fluid in the pleural cavity.
"(v) Early free incision is, as a rule, to be steadfastly avoided. Some"
cases already quoted fully illustrate its disadvantages.
"a gardener, not a dog, not even a soldier on guard to salute me or let"
"me examine his sword-bayonet. And now when this dear, this sweet old"
"Señora comes by with her lovely, lovely goats, you must perforce try to"
pull me off as if I were a village child that had played truant from the
"monks' school and must be birched for its fault!"""
"All the while she was speaking, the young Princess directed a shower of"
"harmless blows at the skirts of her attendant, which Doña Susana"
"laughingly warded off, begging all the while for pity, and instancing"
"the direct commands of the little girl's mother, apparently a very"
"exalted personage indeed, as a reason for her interference."
"But Isabel of Spain was not to be appeased, and presently she had"
recourse to tears in the midst of her fury.
"""You hate me--I know you do--that is what it means,"" she cried, ""you"
"would not have me happy even for a moment. But one day I shall be Queen,"
"and do as I like! Yes, and drink as much warm goat's milk as I want, in"
"spite of all the stupid, wicked, cruel Susanas in the world. And I shall"
throw you into a dungeon with nothing but mice and rats and serpents and
"centipedes--yes, and snails that leave a white slimy trail over you"
"when they crawl! Ugh! And I will have your hands tied, so that you shall"
"not be able to brush them off when they tickle your neck. Yes, I will,"
"Susana! I swear it, and I am growing big--so big! And soon I shall be"
"old enough to have you put in prison with the mice and snails, bad"
"Susana! Oh, wicked Susana!"""
"Now, whether these childish threats actually had some effect, or whether"
"the old lady was so soft-hearted as her comfortable appearance denoted,"
certain it is that she took a key from her pocket and passed it through
the tall gilt railings to La Giralda.
"A complete bibliography, cataloguing the whole of Croce's multifarious"
"activity, is outside the scope of this note. The nearest approach to it"
"can be found in G. Castellano's _Introduzione alle opere di B. Croce_,"
"Bari, 1920, which contains, besides, a full list of translations in"
"eight languages, a bibliography of the Italian and foreign critical"
"literature on Croce, and a very useful series of abstracts of"
discussions and judgments on Croce's work.
Besides articles and essays in American and English magazines and
"reviews, the following works of Croce have been translated into"
"English: the four volumes of the _Filosofia dello Spirito_, the essay"
"on Hegel, the _Essence of Ãsthetics_, and the essays on _Ariosto,"
"Shakespeare, and Corneille_, by Douglas Ainslie; the essay on Vico, by"
"R. G. Collingwood, and the essays on Historical Materialism, by C. M."
Meredith. But the English or American student of Croce ought to rely
as little as possible on translations; the reading of the Italian text
"will be found comparatively easy, on the basis of a good acquaintance"
with Latin or with French. The labour entailed by the surmounting
of the first difficulties will be largely repaid by the advantages
"gained in coming into direct contact with Croce's thought, and by the"
acquisition of at least a reading knowledge of Italian.
"For the vast critical literature on Croce, scattered through the"
literary and philosophical reviews of Europe and of America during
"the last twenty years, we are compelled again to refer the reader to"
Castellano's book. We shall only mark out Croce's own autobiographical
"notes, the Contributo listed above, which, however, having been printed"
"for private circulation only, is not generally accessible except in"
the French translation printed in the _Revue de MÃ©taphysique et de
"Morale_, XXVI, pp. 1-40. The following are the only books which give"
"a general view of Croce's thought: G. Prezzolini, _Benedetto Croce_,"
"Naples, 1909; E. Chiocchetti, _La filosofia di B. Croce_, Florence,"
"""Certainly I will!""--and Villiers, accepting her card, on which was"
"inscribed her own private name and address, shook hands once more, and"
bowed her courteously out. No sooner had the door closed upon her than
"he sprang upstairs, three steps at a time, and broke impetuously in"
"upon Alwyn, who, seated at a table covered with papers, looked up with"
a surprised smile at the abrupt fashion of his entrance. In a few
minutes he had disburdened himself of the whole story of the
"""Tiger-Lily's"" visit, telling it in a whimsical way of his own, much to"
"the amusement of his friend, who listened, pen in hand, with a"
"half-laughing, half-perplexed light in his fine, poetic eyes."
"""Now did I express the proper opinion?"" he demanded in conclusion. ""Was"
"I not right in thinking you would never consent to be interviewed?"""
"""Right? Why of course you were!""--responded Alwyn quickly. ""Can you"
imagine me calmly stating the details of my personal life and history
"to a strange woman, and allowing her to turn it into a half-guinea"
"article for some society journal! But, Villiers, what an extraordinary"
"state of things we are coming to, if the Press can actually condescend"
"to employ a sort of spy, or literary detective, to inquire into the"
private experience of each man or woman who comes honorably to the
"front!"""
"""Honorably or DIShonorably,--it doesn't matter which,""--said Villiers,"
"""That is just the worst of it. One day it is an author who is"
"'interviewed,' the next it is a murderer,--now a statesman,--then a"
"ballet dancer,--the same honor is paid to all who have won any distinct"

seem able to distinguish between 'notoriety' and 'fame.' The two things
"are so widely, utterly apart! Byron's reputation, for instance, was"

PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS. These valuable illuminants and fuels
"are considered here because, although they are found in traces in"
"older strata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the"
first time in large quantities. They range throughout later
formations down to the most recent.
The oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of
"Colorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those"
"of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large"
field of Ohio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher
systems.
"Petroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably"
originated from the decay of organic matter when buried in
"sedimentary deposits, just as at present in swampy places the"
hydrogen and carbon of decaying vegetation combine to form marsh
"gas. The light and heat of these hydrocarbons we may think of,"
"therefore, as a gift to the civilized life of our race from the"
"humble organisms, both animal and vegetable, of the remote past,"
whose remains were entombed in the sediments of the Ordovician and
later geological ages.
Petroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified
"rocks. Certain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others"
give off its characteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer.
"Many shales are bituminous, and some are so highly charged that"
"small flakes may be lighted like tapers, and several gallons of"
oil to the ton may be obtained by distillation.
But oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain
conditions meet:
"Generally the great park-gates stood hospitably open, and the little"
"town of San Ildefonso, with its lodgings and hostels, was at this season"
crowded with courtiers and hangers-on of the court. Guards circulated
"here and there, or clattered after the Queen-Regent as she drove out on"
the magnificent King's highway which stretched upwards over the
"Guadarrama towards Madrid, or whirled down towards Segovia and the"
plains of Old Castile. Bugles were never long silent in _plaza_ or
"barrack yard. Drums beat, fifes shrilled, and there was a continuous"
trampling of horses as this ambassador or that was escorted to the
"presence of Queen Cristina, widow of Fernando VII., mother of Isabel the"
"Second, and Regent of Spain."
"A word of historical introduction is here necessary, and it shall be but"
"a word. For nearly a quarter of a century Fernando, since he had been"
"restored to a forfeited throne by British bayonets, had acted on the"
ancient Bourbon principle of learning nothing and forgetting nothing.
"His tyrannies became ever more tyrannical, his exactions more shameless,"
his indolent arrogance more oppressive. Twice he had to invoke the aid
"of foreign troops, and once indeed a French army marched from one end of"
Spain to the other.
"But with the coming of his third wife, young Maria Cristina of Naples,"
all this was changed. Under her influence Fernando promptly became meek
and uxorious. Then he revoked the ordinance of a former King which
ordained that no woman should reign in Spain. He recalled his
"revocation, and again promulgated it according as his hope of offspring"
waxed or waned.
"Finally a daughter was born to the ill-mated pair, and Don Carlos, the"
"King's brother and former heir-apparent, left the country. Immediately"
upon the King's death civil war divided the state. The stricter
legitimists who stood for Don Carlos included the church generally and
Could any one doubt who the other person in that strangely revealed
"photograph was, or fail to guess the relation between the man they had"
"been listening to and the man who was dead? A few had known Benyon, more"
"Gaspard, all Medland--the three figures of this drama; many remembered"
"the fourth, the central character, who had not tarried for the end of"
"it: the man was rare who did not spend a thought on the bright girl,"
"whose face was so familiar in these walls, and who must be dragged into"
"it. Where was she? asked one. She was gone. Norburn, with rapid"
"instinct, as soon as he had read, had run to her and forced her to go"
"home. He was back from escorting her now, and walked up and down with"
"hands behind him, speaking to no one among all the busily babbling"
throng.
"The waverers stood in a little group by themselves, talking earnestly in"
"undertones, while men wondered whether the paper would undo what the"
"speech had done, and whether the Premier's words had won a victory, only"
for his deeds to leap to light and rob it from him again.
"Inside, the debate lagged on, surely the dullest, emptiest, most"
neglected debate that had ever decided the fate of a Government. The men
who had been set down to speak came in and spoke and went out again; a
"House was kept, but with little to spare. Sir Robert went in and took"
"his place, opposite Medland, who never stirred through all the hours."
"Presently Sir Robert wrote a note, twisted it, and flung it to the"
"Premier. ""A splendid performance of yours, _mes compliments_,"" it said,"
"and, when Medland looked across to acknowledge it, Sir Robert smiled"
"kindly, and nodded his silver head, and the Premier answered him with a"
"glad gleam in his deep-set eyes. These two men, who were always"
"fighting, knew one another, and liked one another for what they knew."
"And this little episode done, Sir Robert rose and pricked and pinked the"
"Premier's points, making sharp fun of his heroics, and weightily"
"criticising his proposals. Now the House did fill a little, for after"
is proud of it.
"""It comes from my home."" And then he asks about the bread of Sicily. Is"
"it any whiter than _this_--the Mandas rock. Yes, it is a little whiter."
"At which they gloom again. For it is a very sore point, this bread."
Bread means a great deal to an Italian: it is verily his staff of life.
"He practically lives on bread. And instead of going by taste, he now,"
"like all the world, goes by eye. He has got it into his head that bread"
"should be white, so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the"
loaf a shadow falls on his soul. Nor is he altogether wrong. For
"although, personally, I don't like white bread any more, yet I do like"
"my brown bread to be made of pure, unmixed flour. The peasants in"
"Sicily, who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown"
"bread, ah, it is amazing how fresh and sweet and _clean_ their loaf"
"seems, so perfumed as home-bread used all to be before the war. Whereas"
"the bread of the commune, the regulation supply, is hard, and rather"
"coarse and rough, so rough and harsh on the palate. One gets tired to"
death of it. I suspect myself the maize meal mixed in. But I don't know.
"And finally the bread varies immensely from town to town, from commune"
to commune. The so-called just and equal distribution is all my-eye. One
"place has abundance of good sweet bread, another scrapes along, always"
"stinted, on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff. And the poor suffer"
"bitterly, really, from the bread-stinting, because they depend so on"
this one food. They say the inequality and the injustice of distribution
comes from the Camorra--la grande Camorra--which is no more nowadays
"than a profiteering combine, which the poor hate. But for myself, I"
"don't know. I only know that one town--Venice, for example--seems to"
"have an endless supply of pure bread, of sugar, of tobacco, of"
salt--while Florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the
"stinting of these supplies--which are all government monopoly, doled out"
accordingly.
"George crossed London Bridge, attired in his Quaker disguise, and made"
"his way to Deptford, where he preached in the streets. From Deptford"
"he followed the river by easy stages to Sheerness, where he lodged nearly"
"a week, awaiting a boat that would answer his purpose. Had he attempted"
"to board a vessel, he would have been seized and examined; therefore his"
"plan was to grow violent in his preaching, and, if possible, provoke the"
authorities to place him on board one of the outgoing crafts; that being
a favorite method of the king's men in getting rid of the too blatant
fanatics in Sheerness.
"The Dutch sea captains were fanatics almost to a man, and the exiled"
exhorters found them always willing to help their persecuted brethren of
the faith.
And so it happened with George in Sheerness. He was on the dock exhorting
"vehemently against the evils of the time, laying great stress on the"
wickedness of the king and denouncing the vileness of the court. Two of
"the king's officers tried to silence him, but failing, ordered him to"
leave England by a certain Dutch boat then waiting in the harbor with its
"pennant up. He protested and struggled, but at last was forced aboard,"
"raving against those godless Balaamites, the clergy of the Established"
"Church, who, with the devil, he declared, were behind his persecution."
So well did George play his part that a collection was taken up among the
passengers of the Dutch boat to help the good man so vilely put upon.
"There was a sweet bit of irony in the fact, learned afterwards, that the"
officers who forced George aboard the Dutch ship were at Sheerness for
the purpose of winning the two hundred pounds reward offered for his
capture.
The goodness of God occasionally takes a whimsical form.
involved in a series of polemics. To let the opposition of opponents
"pass unnoticed was forbidden not only by his character, for ever"
"striving to justify himself in the eyes of the world, but also by the"
"custom of his time, so eager for dispute."
"There were, first of all, his polemics with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples,"
"or in Latinized form, Faber Stapulensis, the Parisian theologian, who as"
"a preparer of the Reformation may, more than anyone else, be ranked with"
Erasmus. At the moment when Erasmus got into the travelling cart which
"was to take him to Louvain, a friend drew his attention to a passage in"
"the new edition of Faber's commentary on St. Paul's epistles, in which"
"he controverted Erasmus's note on the Second Epistle to the Hebrews,"
"verse 7. Erasmus at once bought Faber's book, and soon published an"
"_Apologia_. It concerned Christ's relation to God and the angels, but"
"the dogmatic point at issue hinged, after all, on a philological"
interpretation of Erasmus.
"Not yet accustomed to much direct wrangling, Erasmus was violently"
"agitated by the matter, the more as he esteemed Faber highly and"
considered him a congenial spirit. 'What on earth has occurred to the
man? Have others set him on against me? All theologians agree that I am
"right,' he asserts. It makes him nervous that Faber does not reply again"
at once. Badius has told Peter Gilles that Faber is sorry about it.
Erasmus in a dignified letter appeals to their friendship; he will
suffer himself to be taught and censured. Then again he growls: Let him
be careful. And he thinks that his controversy with Faber keeps the
world in suspense: there is not a meal at which the guests do not side
with one or the other of them. But finally the combat abated and the
friendship was preserved.
"Towards Easter 1518, Erasmus contemplated a new journey to Basle, there"
"to pass through the press, during a few months of hard labour, the"
"immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in"
"appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly"
"bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening."
Chandler’s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office
of an architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered
architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he
would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building
was inferior in design to the great cathedral in Milan.
Out of each week’s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each
"ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one"
gentleman’s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.
He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he
"took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and"
"there dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a"
"few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a"
"well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label,"
"commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras."
This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to
Chandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one
début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened;
"but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as"
new as the first had been. To sit among _bon vivants_ under palms in
"the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the _habitués_ of such a"
paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl’s first dance and
short-sleeved tulle compared with this?
Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this
evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine
evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious _table
"it than anybody else except God 'lmighty. If the fish hug the shore,"
"then we're up against it, but I think they strike in about here; that's"
"why I chose this site. We can't tell, though, till the run starts. All"
"we can do now is see that them people keep their distance."""
"The ""lead"" of a salmon-trap consists of a row of web-hung piling that"
"runs out from the shore for many hundred feet, forming a high, stout"
fence that turns the schools of fish and leads them into cunningly
"contrived enclosures, or ""pounds,"" at the outer extremity, from which"
"they are ""brailed"" as needed. These corrals are so built that once the"
fish are inside they cannot escape. The entire structure is devised
"upon the principle that the salmon will not make a short turn, but will"
swim as nearly as possible in a straight line. It looked to Boyd as if
"Marsh, by blocking the line of progress above and below, had virtually"
"destroyed the efficiency of the new trap, rendering the cost of its"
construction a total loss.
"""Sometimes you can cork a trap and sometimes you can't,"" Balt went on."
"""It all depends on the currents, the lay of the bars, and a lot of"
things we don't know nothing about. I've spent years in trying to
"locate the point where them fish strike in, and I think it's just below"
"here. It'll all depend on how good I guessed."""
"""Exactly! And if you guessed wrong--"""
"""Then we'll fish with nets, like we used to before there was any traps."""
"That evening, when he had seen the night-shift started, Emerson decided"
"to walk up to Cherry's house, for he was worried over the day's"
developments and felt that an hour of the girl's society might serve to
clear his thoughts. His nerves were high-strung from the tension of the
"past weeks, and he knew himself in the condition of an athlete trained"
"[Sidenote: ""The Courteous Spaniard.""]"
"A few days ago we visited the Church of St. Laurence Without the Walls,"
"where in a silver shrine under the high altar, the remains of St."
Laurence and St. Stephen are said to rest. The walls of the portico of
"the church are covered with a series of frescoes, lately repainted. One"
series represents the story of St. Stephen and that of the translation
"of his relics to this church. ""The relics of St. Stephen were preserved"
"at Constantinople, whither they had been transported from Jerusalem by"
"the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius II. Hearing that her daughter,"
"Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian II., Emperor of the West, was afflicted"
"with a devil, she begged her to come to Constantinople, that her demon"
might be driven out by the touch of the relics. The younger Eudoxia
"wished to comply, but the devil refused to leave her unless St. Stephen"
was brought to Rome. An agreement was therefore made that the relics
of St. Stephen should be exchanged for those of St. Laurence. St.
"Stephen arrived, and the Empress was immediately relieved of her devil;"
but when the persons who had brought the relics of St. Stephen from
"Constantinople were about to take those of St. Laurence back with them,"
they all fell down dead! Pope Pelagius prayed for their restoration
"to life, which was granted for a short time, to prove the efficacy of"
"prayer, but they all died again ten days later! Thus the Romans knew"
"that it would be criminal to fulfil their promise, and part with the"
"relics of St. Laurence, and the bodies of the two martyrs were laid in"
"the same sarcophagus."" And thus we know how much more the Romans think"
"of relics than of honor and truth. ""It is related that when they opened"
"the sarcophagus, and lowered into it the body of St. Stephen, St."
"Laurence moved on one side, giving the place of honor on the right hand"
"to St. Stephen; hence, the common people of Rome have conferred on St."
"Laurence the title of '_Il cortese Spagnuolo_'--the courteous Spaniard."""
"not seem to remember, for he looked at them all, was silent and smiled"
... in a guilty way. Those men spoke very little to each other about
"their past, and they recalled it very seldom and then only its general"
"outlines.  When they did mention it, it was in a cynical tone."
"Probably, this was just as well, since, in many people, remembrance of"
the past kills all present energy and deadens all hope for the future.
*      *      *      *      *
"On rainy, cold, or dull days in the late autumn, these ""creatures that"
"once were men"" gathered in the eatinghouse of Vaviloff. They were well"
"known there, where some feared them as thieves and rogues, and some"
"looked upon them contemptuously as hard drinkers, although they"
"respected them, thinking that they were clever."
"The eating-house of Vaviloff was the club of the main street, and the"
"""creatures that once were men"" were its most intellectual members.  On"
"Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings, when the eating-house was packed,"
"the ""creatures that once were men"" were only too welcome guests.  They"
"brought with them, besides the forgotten and poverty-stricken"
"inhabitants of the street, their own spirit, in which there was"
something that brightened the lives of men exhausted and worn out in
"the struggle for existence, as great drunkards as the inhabitants of"
"Kuvalda's shelter, and, like them, outcasts from the town.  Their"
"ability to speak on all subjects, their freedom of opinion, skill in"
"repartee, courage in the presence of those of whom the whole street was"
"in terror, together with their daring demeanour, could not but be"
"pleasing to their companions.  Then, too, they were well versed in law,"
"and could advise, write petitions, and help to swindle without"
incurring the risk of punishment.  For all this they were paid with
vodki and flattering admiration of their talents.
That is part of our belief; that is the strongest part of our belief;
"and that is the hope that all fervent Christians have, that those they"
love may be saved even at the end.
I think it may truly be said that our Western creeds are all directed at
"the hour of death, as the great and final test of that creed."
And now think of Buddhism; it is a creed of life. In life you must win
"your way to salvation by urgent effort, by suffering, by endurance. On"
"your death-bed you can do nothing. If you have done well, then it is"
"well; if ill, then you must in future life try again and again till you"
"succeed. A life is not washed, a soul is not made fit for the dwelling"
"of eternity, in a moment."
Repentance to a Buddhist is but the opening of the eyes to see the path
to righteousness; it has no virtue in itself. To have seen that we are
sinners is but the first step to cleansing our sin; in itself it cannot
purify.
"As well ask a robber of the poor to repent, and suppose thereby that"
those who have suffered from his guilt are compensated for the evil done
"to them by his repentance, as to ask a Buddhist to believe that a sinner"
can at the last moment make good to his own soul all the injuries caused
to that soul by the wickedness of his life.
Or suppose a man who has destroyed his constitution by excess to be by
the very fact of acknowledging that excess restored to health.
The Buddhist will not have that at all. A man is what he makes himself;
"and that making is a matter of terrible effort, of unceasing endeavour"
"towards the right, of constant suppression of sin, till sin be at last"
as obediently as well-trained dogs. Most of them were of the usual
"dark-red colour, a trifle soiled with the grey dust on which they had"
"been lying. A few were white, and these were the favourites of the"
"little Queen, who, though compelled to go on ahead, looked constantly"
back over her shoulder and endeavoured to imitate the shrill whistling
call by which La Giralda kept her flock in place.
When they arrived at the palace front the doors stood wide open. At Doña
"Susana's call an ancient major-domo appeared, his well-developed"
waistcoat mating ill with the pair of shrunk and spindle shanks which
"appeared beneath. The sentry boxes, striped red and gold with the"
"colours of Spain, were empty. At the guard-houses there were no lounging"
sergeants or smart privates eager to rise and salute as the little Queen
passed by.
There was already indeed about the palace an air of desolation. The
"great gates in front towards the town had been closed, as if to shut off"
"infection, and the Court itself, dwindled to a few faithful old"
"retainers of Fernando VII., surrounded his widow and her new husband"
with a devotion which was yet far more than their due.
It was not long before La Giralda had milked the remainder of the flock
and sent the creaming white pitchers into the palace. Little Isabel
danced with delight as one she-goat after another escaped with infinite
tail-waggling and bleatings of pleasure. And in the dearth of other
amusement she desired and even commanded the old woman to remain and
pasture her herd within the precincts of the palace. But La Giralda had
much yet to do. She must find out the state and dispositions of the town
"of San Ildefonso, and then rejoin her companions in the little corrie or"
cauldron-like _cirque_ in which she and the sergeant had left Rollo and
the other members of the expedition.
RESOLVENT.--A substance indicated in the treatment or absorption of
"hard, callous tissue, as iodine and its preparations."
"RESTORATIVE.--A medicine that aids in restoring the health, as nux"
"vomica, arsenic, etc."
REVULSANT or REVULSIVE.--An agent which produces irritation and draws
"fluids from other parts diseased, as poultices, cantharides, etc."
RUBEFACIENT.--A medicine or agent causing irritation and redness of the
"skin, as turpentine, mustard, etc."
"SEDATIVE.--A medicine which diminishes functional activity, as potassium"
"or ammonium bromide, etc."
SEPTIC.--An agent causing poisoning resulting from the absorption of
"products of putrefaction, as bacteria."
"SIALOGOGUE.--A medicine stimulating the flow of saliva, as pilocarpine,"
"arecoline, ginger, capsicum, etc."
SOMNIFACIENT or SOPORIFIC.--A medicine which produces drowsiness and
"sleep, as morphine, chloral hydrate, potassium, bromide, etc."
"SORBEFACIENT.--A medicine used to produce abortion, as ergot."
SPECIFIC.--A medicine or agent which has a distinct curative influence
"on an individual disease, as potassium iodide in actinomycosis (Lumpy"
"Jaw) or oxygen in milk fever, etc."
"STIMULANT.--A medicine which quickens or increases functional activity,"
"as strychnine, ammonium carbonate, alcohol, etc."
"chieftains to assist them in their affrays with rival tribes, and made"
more than one alliance by giving such assistance. But the later
atrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards seem to have had the effect of
uniting the Indians in a tacit peaceful bond against the whites.
"Picturesque and graphic as are the writings of men like Esquemeling, the"
"Fray d’Acosta and Wafer, who saw the Indians in the days of their"
earliest experience with the sort of civilization that Pedrarias and
"Pizarro brought to their villages, they do not bear more convincing"
"evidence of the savagery of the invaders, than is afforded by the sullen"
aloofness with which the Darien Indians of today regard white men of any
race. More than the third and fourth generation have passed away but the
sins of the Spaniards are still recalled among a people who have no
"written records whatsoever, and the memory or tradition causes them to"
withhold their friendship from the remotest descendants of the historic
oppressors.
"There seems to have been no written language, nor even any system of"
"hieroglyphics among the tribes of Panama, a fact that places them far"
below our North American Indians in the scale of mental development. On
the other hand in weaving and in fashioning articles for domestic use
they were in advance of the North American aborigines. Their domestic
"architecture was more substantial, and they were less nomadic, the"
latter fact being probably due to the slight encouragement given to
wandering by the jungle. The great houses of the San Blas Indians in
their villages recall the “Long houses” of the Iroquois as described by
Parkman.

CHOCO INDIAN IN EVERY-DAY DRESS]
DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY
"And lastly, what are our duties to our country? These are essentially to"
win honour for it and also win for it security and peace. As regards
"winning honour for our country, it is true that while India has offered"
from the earliest times welcome and hospitality to all peoples and
nationalities her children have been subjected to intolerable
humiliations in other countries even under the flag of our king.
There can be no question of the fundamental duty of every Indian to
stand up and uphold the honour of his country and strove for the removal
of wrong.
"The general task of redressing wrong is not a problem of India alone,"
but one in which the righteous men are interested the world over. For
"wrong cries for redress everywhere, in the clashings interests of the"
"rich and poor, between capital and labour, between those who hold the"
"power and those from whom it has been withheld,--in a word in the"
struggle of the Disinherited.
When any man is rendered unable to uphold his manhood and self-respect
and woman are deprived of the chivalrous protection and consideration of
"men and subjected to degradation, the general level of manhood or"
womanhood in the world is lowered. It then becomes an outrage to
humanity and a challenge to all men to safeguard the sacredness of our
common human nature.
What is the machinery which sets a going a world movement for the
redress of wrong? For this I need not cite instances from the history of
other countries but take one which is known to you and in which the
living actors are still among us. In the midst of the degradation of his
but none could give the answer.
*      *      *      *      *
"A wild, wet September day was drawing to its close, amid pelting squalls"
"of cold rain, when a tall young man, gaunt and hollow-eyed, pushed his"
way into a small coffee-house in an obscure thoroughfare somewhere in
"the region of Drury Lane, and took a seat in a dark corner as near to"
"the stove as he could get, for he looked pinched with cold, and his"
plain and rather threadbare black suit was pretty well wet through.  As
"soon as he was seated, he drew from his breast a roll of paper, which he"
"regarded with solicitude.  That at least was dry, and he heaved a sigh"
that sounded like one of satisfaction.
"In this narrow street the daylight had completely faded, though it was"
not yet six o’clock.  The room was furthermore darkened by clouds of
tobacco smoke which the guests were puffing forth.  The smell of coffee
"mingled with the ranker fumes of the tobacco, and the clink of cup and"
"spoon made ceaseless accompaniment to the talk, which went on in a"
continuous stream.
"Grey (for it was he) leaned his head on his hand wearily, and fell into"
something like a doze as he sat in his shadowy corner.  He was exhausted
"in mind and in body.  He was faint with hunger, and yet half afraid to"
"order food; for his funds were dwindling almost to the vanishing point,"
and as yet he had found no means of replenishing his exchequer. But he
had not been able to resist the temptation to escape from the buffetings
"of the tempest, and when the boy in attendance upon the guests came to"
"ask his pleasure, he ordered some coffee and bread, and devoured it with"
a ravenous appetite when it was set before him.
"The pangs of hunger stayed, if not appeased, he began to look about him,"
"had written long ago and read it through, sweet and tender memories"
"crowded upon me, and in my eyes stood blinding tears.  I may be forgiven"
"for this, I think, when it is remembered how fondly I had once loved"
"Yolande, before that fatal day when jealousy had consumed me, and I had"
turned my back upon her as a woman false and worthless.
"Letter after letter I read, each bringing back to me sad memories of"
"those days, when in the calm sunset hour we had wandered by the"
"riverside hand in hand like children, each supremely content in each"
"other's love, fondly believing that our mad passion would last always."
"In all the world she had been, to me, incomparable.  The centre of"
"admiration at those brilliant balls at the Royal Palace at Brussels, the"
most admired of all the trim and comely girls who rode at morning in the
"Bois, the merriest of those who picnicked in the forest round about the"
"ancient chateau, the sweetest, the most tender, and the most pure of all"
"the women I knew--Yolande in those days had been mine.  There, in my"
"hand, I held the letter which I had written from Scotland when on leave"
"for the shooting, asking if she loved me sufficiently to become my wife."
"To that letter I well remembered her reply--indeed, I knew it verbatim;"
"a tender letter, full of honest love and straightforward admission--a"
"letter such as only a pure and good woman could have penned.  Yes, she"
"wrote that she loved me dearly, and would be my wife."
And yet it was all of the past.  All had ended.
"I sighed bitterly--how bitterly, mere words cannot describe.  You,"
"reader, be you man or woman, can you fully realise how deeply I felt at"
"that moment, how utterly desolate the world then seemed to me?"
"Those letters I slowly replaced in the cavity and closed it.  Then, as I"
"turned away, my eyes fell upon the photographs standing upon a small"
whatnot close by the escritoire.  They were of persons whom I did not
"circumstances mere nonsense--which it very likely was--and said so,"
"which betrayed inexperience, and Alicia Derosne asked what time it took"
place.
"""Eleven sharp,"" said the Governor, and returned to the account of the"
murder.
Time after time in the last few days Alicia had told herself that she
"could bear it no longer. At one moment she believed nothing, the next,"
nothing was too terrible for her to believe; now she would fly to
"Australia, or home, or anywhere out of New Lindsey; now a"
straightforward challenge to Medland alone would serve her turn.
Sometimes she felt as if she could put the whole thing on one side; five
minutes later found her pinning her whole life on the issue of it. Under
"her guarded face and calm demeanour, the storm of divided and"
"conflicting instincts and passions raged, and long solitary rambles"
became a necessary outlet for what she dared show to none. She shrank
"from seeing Medland, and yet longed to speak with him; she felt that to"
"mention the topic to him was impossible, and yet, if they met,"
"inevitable; that she would not have strength to face him, and yet could"
not let him go without clearing up the mystery. She told herself at one
"moment that she hardly knew him, at the next that between them nothing"
could be too secret for utterance.
What she hoped and feared befell her that morning. She went out for a
"walk in the Park, and before long she met the Premier, with his daughter"
and Norburn. The two last were laughing and talking--their quarrel was
"quite forgotten now--and Medland himself, she thought, looked as though"
his load of care were a little less heavy. The two men explained that
"they were on their way--a roundabout way, they confessed--to the"
"Council, and had seized the chance of some fresh air, while Daisy was"
"full of stories about yesterday's triumph, that left room only for a"
"ACTIONS.--Salicylic acid, sodium salicylate and phenyl salicylate are"
"powerful antiseptic, anti-rheumatic, diaphoretic, cardiac depressant,"
antiferment and antipyretic. Salicylic acid is in addition irritant and
"astringent, continued in large doses is apt to derange digestion; best"
to be administered on a full stomach.
"USES.--For acute rheumatism, influenza, strangles and purpura where"
"there is much sloughing; also as a surgical wash, salicylic acid one"
"part, borax one part to thirty or forty parts of water. Salicylic acid"
is a more powerful antiseptic than carbolic acid. Salicylic of soda is
freely antiseptic. Salicylic acid is highly recommended in intestinal
"flatulence, given in two drachm doses with one ounce of aromatic spirits"
"of ammonia. In gastric-flatulence give two drachms in capsule, repeat in"
half hour if necessary.
ACONITUM--ACONITE--MONKSHOOD
"DERIVATION.--Aconite is obtained from the root of aconitum napellus,"
"which grows in Northwestern North America, Europe and Asia in"
"mountainous regions, and cultivated in the United States for its"
beautiful flowers.
"PROPERTIES.--The fresh leaves have a faint narcotic odor, most sensible"
"when they are rubbed. Their taste is at first bitterish and herbaceous,"
"afterwards burning and acrid, with a feeling of numbness and tingling on"
"the inside of the lips, tongue and fauces, which is very durable,"
lasting sometimes many hours. When long chewed they inflame the tongue.
"The dried leaves have a similar taste, but the acrid impression"
And thus they speak till far on in the night or till they have
"quarrelled, the usual result of drink or of passions engendered by such"
discussions.
"The rain beats on the windows, and outside the cold wind is blowing."
"The eating-house is close with tobacco smoke, but it is warm, while the"
"street is cold and wet.  Now and then, the wind beats threateningly on"
"the windows of the eating-house, as if bidding these men to come out"
and be scattered like dust over the face of the earth.  Sometimes a
stifled and hopeless groan is heard in its howling which again is
"drowned by cold, cruel laughter.  This music fills one with dark, sad"
"thoughts of the approaching winter, with its accursed short, sunless"
"days and long nights, of the necessity of possessing warm garments and"
plenty to eat.  It is hard to sleep through the long winter nights on
"an empty stomach.  Winter is approaching.  Yes, it is approaching..."
How to live?
These gloomy forebodings created a strong thirst among the inhabitants
"of the main street, and the sighs of the ""creatures that once were men"""
"increased with the wrinkles on their brows, their voices became thick"
and their behaviour to each other more blunt.  And brutal crimes were
"committed among them, and the roughness of these poor unfortunate"
"outcasts was apt to increase at the approach of that inexorable enemy,"
who transformed all their lives into one cruel farce.  But this enemy
could not be captured because it was invisible.
"Then they began beating each other brutally, and drank till they had"
drunk everything which they could pawn to the indulgent Vaviloff.  And
"thus they passed the autumn days in open wickedness, in suffering which"
"was eating their hearts out, unable to rise out of this vicious life"
and in dread of the still crueller days of winter.
A horde of civilians was thronging the main street of the village. Old
men and women were carrying all that was left to them of their property
on their backs. Others were pushing wheelbarrows heaped up with clothes
and household utensils. Girls were carrying heavy bundles under their
"arms and dragging tired, tearful children along. White-faced, sorrowful"
"mothers were carrying peevish babies. Great wagons, loaded with"
"furniture and bedding, and whole families sitting on top, were drawn by"
"lank and bony horses. A little cart, with a pallid, aged woman cowering"
"inside, was drawn painfully along by a white-haired man. They passed by"
"us in the gathering gloom, and there seemed to be no end to these"
"straggling multitudes of ruined, homeless people who were wandering"
westwards to escape the disaster that threatened to engulf us all.
The eastern sky flickered with vivid gun-flashes and scintillated with
brilliant shell-bursts. The night was full of rustling noises and sullen
"thunder-claps, while a more distant roaring and rumbling seemed to break"
against some invisible shore like the breakers of a stormy sea.
We retired to our huts and tents. Soon after lights-out the Police
Corporal came round and shouted:
"""Parade at 4.45 to-morrow morning in marching order."""
The tumult increased as though the surge were coming nearer and nearer.
Shells of small calibre passed overhead with a prolonged whistle and
burst with a hardly audible report. The thunder of bigger explosions
shook the huts and caused the ground to tremble.
As I woke the next morning the din of the cannonade broke in upon my
"senses with a sudden impact. Rumbling, thundering, bellowing, rushing,"
"whistling, and whining, the tumult seemed all around and above us."
Sudden flashes lit up the whole camp so that for fractions of seconds

just above the wrist prior to entering the abdomen. No local or
constitutional signs indicated either bowel injury or
"perforation of liver. The man, however, was suffering from a"
"slight attack of dysentery, passing blood and mucus per rectum"
with great tenesmus. He was sent to the Base at the end of a
"week, and returned to England well three weeks later. He"
"attributed his dysentery to the wound, as the symptoms did not"
exist prior to its reception; but as the disease coincided
exactly with what was very prevalent amongst the troops at the
"time, I do not think there was any connection between it and"
the injury.

The bowels acted involuntarily simultaneously with the
"vomiting, and incontinence of fæces and retention of urine"
persisted for four days. The vomit was bilious in appearance;
no blood was seen either in it or the motions.
Forty-six hours after the injury the condition was as follows:

"pulse 116, regular and of fair strength; respirations 24;"
Panama’s poor:

"Miguel lived on the banks of the Chagres River, about half way between"
Cruces and Alhajuela. To him Cruces was a city. Were there not at least
thirty huts of bamboo and clay thatched with palmetto like the one in
"which he lived? Was there not a church of sawn boards, with an altar to"
"which a priest came twice a month to say mass, and a school where a"
gringo taught the children strange things in the hated English tongue?
Where he lived there was no other hut within two or three hours poling
"up the river, but down at Cruces the houses were so close together you"
could almost reach one while sitting in the shade of another. At home
"after dark you only heard the cry of the whippoorwill, or occasionally"
"the wail of a tiger cat in the jungle, but at Cruces there was always"
"the loud talk of the men in the cantina, and a tom-tom dance at least"
"once a week, when everybody sat up till dawn dancing to the beat of the"
drums and drinking the good rum that made them all so jolly.
But greater than Cruces was the Yankee town of Matachin down on the
banks of the river where the crazy Americans said there was going to be
"a lake that some day would cover all the country, and drown out Cruces"
and even his father’s house. They were paying all the natives along the
"river for their lands that would be sunken, and the people were taking"
the pesos gladly and spending them gaily. They did not trouble to move
"away. Many years ago the French too said there would be a lake, but it"
never came and the French suddenly disappeared. The Americans would
"vanish the same way, and a good thing, too, for their thunderous noises"
"where they were working frightened away all the good game, and you could"
"hardly find an iguana, or a wild hog in a day’s hunting."

"are apt to be associated with somnambulism, points out that when the"
somnambulism replaces the night-terrors it leaves no memory behind
"(_British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899, p. 465). An interesting"
study of movement in normal and morbid sleep has been contributed by
"Segre ('Contributo alla Conoscenza dei Movimenti del Sonno,' _Archivio di"
"Psichiatria_, 1907, fasc. 1.).]"
"[Footnote 78: This question is, for instance, asked by F. H. Bradley ('On"
"the Failure of Movement in Dreams,' _Mind_, 1894, p. 373). The explanation"
he prefers is that the dream vision is out of relation to the very dimly
"conscious actual position of the body, so that the information necessary"
to complete the idea of the movement is wanting. Only as regards the less
"complicated movements of lips, tongue, or finger, when the motor idea is"
"in harmony with the actual position of the body movements, does movement"
take place. We have no means of distinguishing the real world from the
world of our vision; 'our images thus move naturally to realise themselves
in the world of our real limbs. But the world and its arrangement is for
"the moment out of connection with our ideas, and hence the attempt at"
motion for the most part must fail.' It is quite true that this conflict
"is an important factor in dreaming, but it fails to apply to the large"
number of movements which we dream of actually doing.]
[Footnote 79: The action of some drugs produces a state in this respect
resembling that which prevails in dreams. 'Under the influence of a large
"dose of haschisch,' Professor Stout remarks (_Analytic Psychology_, vol."
"i. p. 14), 'I found myself totally unable to distinguish between what"
"I actually did and saw, and what I merely thought about.' Not only are"
"the motor and sensory activities relatively dormant, but the central"
"activity is perfectly able, and content, to dispense with their services."
"'Thought,' as Jastrow says (_Fact and Fable in Psychology_, p. 386), 'is"
although the dream might be said to lend itself to such suggestions.
The idea of moral retribution and eternal punishment may also be present
in dreams. This may be illustrated by the dream of a lady who had an ill
"and restless girl companion sleeping with her, and was disturbed as well"
by a yelping and howling terrier outside. She had also lately heard that
a friend had brought over a python from Africa. 'I dreamed last night I
had a basket of cold squirming snakes beside me; they just touched me all
"over, but did not hurt; I felt mad with loathing and hate of them, and"
"the beasts would not kill me. That, I thought, was my eternal punishment"
for my sins.' In her waking moments the dreamer was not apprehensive of
"eternal punishment, and it may be in such a case that, as Freud suggests,"
an unfamiliar moral idea emerges in sleep in much the same way as an
unfamiliar or 'forgotten' fact may emerge.
"On the whole, it may be said that while the moral attitude of the dreaming"
"state is not usually identical with that of the waking state, there still"
nearly always is a moral attitude. It could not well be otherwise. Our
emotional states are intimately bound up with moral relationships; we
"could not display such highly emotional states as we experience in dreams,"
"with all their tragic accompaniments, in the absence of any sense of"
morality.

herself up and asking me if it was cold—and her little nose looked...

"she said, “you mustn’t mind about me. You mustn’t disappoint your young"

It made me feel worse than ever. I began to wonder... then she dropped

"she never did. “Whatever are you doing!” I cried, running to stop her."
"“Well,” she said, smiling, you know, madam, “I shall have to begin to"

But if I dwell on all these interesting relics and images as I have
"done on the Holy Cradle and the miraculous Bambino, I shall never"
finish even the brief list of them which I had in mind when I began. I
"must hasten on, contenting myself with a bare mention of a few of the"
more notable relics at the other churches.
On the 8th of January we paid our first visit to the great Church of
"St. John Lateran,[9] and here also the relics interested us more than"
anything else. Under the canopy in the centre the skulls of St. Peter
and St. Paul are preserved. Beneath the altar we saw the wooden table
"on which the Apostle Peter is said to have ""celebrated mass"" in the"
"house of Pudens. The interest of this relic, however, is completely"
eclipsed by that of another relic over an altar at a little distance
"in the same church, viz: the cedar table used by our Lord and his"
disciples in the Last Supper. This table is concealed behind a bronze
relief representing that solemn scene in the Upper Room at Jerusalem.
[Sidenote: Other Relics at St. John Lateran.]
"""The Basilica claims to possess many valuable relics. Amongst these are"
"some portions of the manger in which Christ was cradled, the shirt and"
seamless coat made for him by the Virgin; some of the barley loaves
"will attribute such qualities as are predominant in themselves, as they"
"consider admirable; and, indeed, all supernatural beings are but the"
magnified shadows of man cast by the light of his imagination upon the
mists of his ignorance.
"Therefore, when you find that a people make their spirits beautiful and"
"fair, calm and even tempered, loving peace and the beauty of the trees"
"and rivers, shrinkingly averse from loud words, from noises, and from"
"the taking of life, it is because the people themselves think that these"
"are great qualities. If no stress be laid upon their courage, their"
"activity, their performance of great deeds, it is because the people who"
"imagine them care not for such things. There is no truer guide, I am"
"sure, to the heart of a young people than their superstitions; these"
"they make entirely for themselves, apart from their religion, which is,"
"to a certain extent, made for them. That is why I have written this"
chapter on Nats: not because I think it affects Buddhism very much one
"way or another, but because it seems to me to reveal the people"
"themselves, because it helps us to understand them better, to see more"
"with their eyes, to be in unison with their ideas--because it is a great"
key to the soul of the people.

"WHEREIN ""FINGERLESS"" FRASER RETURNS"
"Big George had lost no time, and already the tow-boats were overboard,"
while a raft of timber was taking form alongside the ship. As soon as
"it was completed, it was loaded with crates and boxes and paraphernalia"
"of all sorts, then towed ashore as the tide served. Another took its"
"place, and another and another. All that night the torches flared and"
the decks drummed to a ceaseless activity. In the morning Boyd sent a
"squad of fishermen ashore to clear the ground for his buildings, and"
all day new rafts of lumber and material helped to increase the pile at
the water's edge.
"His early training as an engineer now stood him in good stead, for a"
thousand details demanded expert supervision; but he was as completely
at home at this work as was Big George in his own part of the
"undertaking, and it was not long before order began to emerge from what"
seemed a hopeless chaos. Never did men have more willing hands to do
their bidding than did he and George; and when a week later _The
"Juliet_, with Willis Marsh on board, came to anchor, the bunk-houses"
"were up and peopled, while the new site had become a beehive of"
activity.
"The mouth of the Kalvik River is several miles wide, yet it contains"
"but a small anchorage suitable for deep-draught ships, the rest of the"
harbor being underlaid with mud-bars and tide-flats over which none but
small boats may pass; and as the canneries are distributed up and down
"the stream for a considerable distance, it is necessary to transport"
all supplies to and from the ships by means of tugs and lighters. Owing
"to the narrowness of the channel, _The Juliet_ came to her moorings not"
“From the above one might conclude that cleanliness and modesty are not
"the rule among the Chocos. As a matter of fact, the first thing they do"
"in the morning is to jump into the near-by river, and these ablutions"
are repeated several times in the course of the day.
"“The kitchen utensils are always thoroughly washed before using, and,"
"contrary to our former experience, their simple dishes, prepared mostly"
"in our presence, looked almost always inviting. During our stay among"
these good people nothing was noticed that would hurt the most delicate
sense of decency.
"“The Chocoes seem to be exclusively monogamist, and both parents"
"surround their babies with tender care, being mindful, however, to"
prepare them early for the hard and struggling life ahead of them.
"Small bows and arrows, dexterously handled by tiny hands, are the"
"favorite toys of the boys, while the girls spend more time in the water"
"playing with miniature dugouts, washing, and swimming. The only dolls"
"seen among them were imported ones, and they seemed to be as much in"
favor among grown women as among children. These latter go naked until
"they are about five years old, when the girls receive a large"
"handkerchief to be used as a ‘paruma’, or skirt, and the boys a strip of"
some old maternal dress for an ‘antia’ or clout.
"“The Chocoes are very industrious. During the dry spells their life, of"
"course, is an out-of-door one, planting and watching their crops,"
"hunting, fishing and canoeing. But when the heavy rains come they stay"
"at home, weaving baskets of all kinds--a work in which the women are"
"proficient--making ropes and hammocks, carving dishes, mortars, stools,"
and other objects out of tree trunks”.
In the country which will be traversed by the Panama-David Railroad are
been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor. The sidewalk
"was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers,"
justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon
by some other creature.
The megaphone man raised his instrument of torture; the inside of the
great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee
drinker. The top-riders nervously clung to the seats; the old lady from
"Valparaiso, Indiana, shrieked to be put ashore. But, before a wheel"
"turns, listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone, which shall"
point out to you an object of interest on life’s sightseeing tour.
Swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man
in African wilds; instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between
mother and babe; unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the
slight gulf between animal and man; immeasurably quick and sapient are
the brief messages between one and one’s beloved. But all these
instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and
thought beside one other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall
disclose. You shall learn (if you have not learned already) what two
beings of all earth’s living inhabitants most quickly look into each
other’s hearts and souls when they meet face to face.
"The gong whirred, and the Glaring-at-Gotham car moved majestically upon"
its instructive tour.
"On the highest, rear seat was James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,"
and his Bride.
"Capitalise it, friend typo—that last word—word of words in the epiphany"
"of life and love. The scent of the flowers, the booty of the bee, the"
"primal drip of spring waters, the overture of the lark, the twist of"
"pardoner, a 'pothecary and a pedlar, and for plot only a single"
"conversation, devoid even of the rough play which usually enlivened"
discussions on the stage. In the debate arises a contest as to who can
tell the biggest lie--won by the palmer's statement that he has never
seen a woman out of patience--and that is the sole dramatic element.
"Nevertheless, by sheer wit interest is maintained to the end, every one"
smiling over the rival claims of such veteran humbugs as the old-time
pardoner and apothecary; scant reverence does 'Pothecary vouchsafe to
"Pardoner's potent relics, his 'of All Hallows the blessed jaw-bone', his"
"'great toe of the Trinity', his 'buttock-bone of Pentecost', and the"
rest. One of the raciest passages occurs in the Pardoner's relation of
the wonders he has performed in the execution of his office. Amongst
other deeds of note is the bringing back of a certain woman from hell to
earth. For this purpose the Pardoner visited the lower regions in
person--so he says--and brought her out in triumph with the full and
joyful consent of Lucifer.
[_The_ PARDONER _has entered hell and secured a guide._]
_Pardoner._ This devil and I walked arm in arm
"So far, till he had brought me thither,"
Where all the devils of hell together
Stood in array in such apparel
As for that day there meetly fell.
"Their horns well-gilt, their claws full clean,"
"Their tails well-kempt, and, as I ween,"
With sothery[48] butter their bodies anointed;
I never saw devils so well appointed.
"The master-devil sat in his jacket,"
And all the souls were playing at racket.
"None other rackets they had in hand,"
"Save every soul a good firebrand,"
CHAPTER XIV
THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
WHAT A FORMATION RECORDS. We have already learned that each
"individual body of stratified rock, or formation, constitutes a"
record of the time when it was laid. The structure and the
character of the sediments of each formation tell whether the area
was land or sea at the time when they were spread; and if the
"former, whether the land was river plain, or lake bed, or was"
"covered with wind-blown sands, or by the deposits of an ice sheet."
"If the sediments are marine, we may know also whether they were"
"laid in shoal water near the shore or in deeper water out at sea,"
"and whether during a period of emergence, or during a period of"
subsidence when the sea transgressed the land. By the same means
each formation records the stage in the cycle of erosion of the
land mass from which its sediments were derived. An unconformity
between two marine formations records the fact that between the
periods when they were deposited in the sea the area emerged as
land and suffered erosion. The attitude and structure of the
"strata tell also of the foldings and fractures, the deformation"
"and the metamorphism, which they have suffered; and the igneous"
rocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous intrusions
add other details to the story. Each formation is thus a separate
"local chapter in the geological history of the earth, and its"
strata are its leaves. It contains an authentic record of the
physical conditions--the geography--of the time and place when and
where its sediments were laid.
PAST CYCLES OF EROSION. These chapters in the history of the
referred to above:--
When Mr. Gilbert said that he would like to see the women's parts
"played by boys, he was not uttering a jest. In some of the"
"performances at Westminster School, he had seen boys in women's"
parts much more effective than any professional actress. If women
"players had been proposed to Shakespeare, he would not only have"
"been scandalised, but he would have pointed out that it was"
impossible to get the force from women that was obtained from boy
actors.
NOTE TO THE ARTICLE ON 'COMMERCIAL MORALITY'
In the October number of the _Anglo-Japanese Gazette_ (London) is
"published a criticism by Mr. Curtis, editor and proprietor of the _Kobe"
"Herald_, on 'the ridiculously sweeping assertions,' as he calls it, made"
by Mr. Longford in his article. I subjoin herewith a passage which
relates to Mr. Longford's assertion that a 'cordon' is drawn by the
"Japanese round the trading centres of Yokohama and Kobe, and that"
foreign merchants are suffering under the 'thraldom':--
"Well, let me say that no sane, fair-minded man who knows anything"
whatever of his subject would ever dream of accusing the whole
Japanese people of a lack of commercial morality. All this talk
about a cordon being drawn round the treaty ports is rubbish. No
"such barrier exists, save perhaps in the imagination of a few who"
cannot shake off the prejudices and disabilities of the past. The
"idea sounds absurd to me, knowing, as I do know, that all the"
go-ahead firms have been doing their utmost for some time past to
open up connections in the principal cities. Mr. Longford seems to
think that business is conducted in Japan to-day just as it was
did not deserve to suffer suffered. And that was why the war went on.
Most people were so indifferent that it was impossible to talk to them
without anger. I could think of nothing else but the war. I could not
escape from its invisible presence. The streets and houses seemed the
"immaterial creations of some dream, and somewhere behind them the"
"slaughter was going on, and amid the noise of the traffic the throbbing"
of the bombardment was plainly audible.
Sometimes I felt an impulse to shout from the house-tops like a Hebrew
prophet and denounce this most wicked of generations. But the very
futility of the idea filled me with mortification.
Our enlightened twentieth century has no use for prophets. Christ
Himself would have been arrested as a pacifist or a lunatic if He had
spoken His mind in the streets of London. And the clergy would have
"applauded the imprisonment of a dangerous ""pro-German."" The scribes and"
Pharisees were more numerous and more powerful than ever before.
Particularly the scribes.
There never was in all the world an infamy as great as the infamy of our
war-time Press. A horde of unscrupulous liars and hirelings spat hatred
and malice from safe and comfortable positions. They played the hero
when no danger threatened. They defied an enemy who could not reach
them. They boasted of the deeds they had not done. They gloried in the
victories they did not win. They mouthed frantic protestations of
injured innocence when they should have felt the burden of guilty shame.
They were mawkishly sentimental when they should have felt keen grief
and horror. They denounced murder and they urged others to commit
murder. They spewed their venomous slime into every spring of healing
water. At a time when clear thinking and balanced judgments were needed
"more desperately than ever before, they squirted into the air thick"

us that the aristocrats of old families close their doors to rich

"“I don’t see what you are trying to prove by all this,” said Laura."
“I am trying to prove that all there is underneath distinguished society
"is money, for which reason it doesn’t matter if it is destroyed. The"
"cleverest and finest man, if he has no money, will die of hunger in a"
"corner. Smart society, which thinks itself superior, will never receive"
"him, because being really superior and intelligent is of no value on"
"the market. On the other hand, when it is a question of some very rich"
"brute, he will succeed in being accepted and fêted by the aristocrats,"
"because money has a real value, a quotable value, or I’d better say, it"
is the only thing that has a quotable value.”
“What you are saying isn’t true. A man doesn’t go with the best people
merely because he is rich.”
"“No, certainly; not immediately. There is a preparatory process. He"
"begins by robbing people in some miserable little shop, and feels"
"himself democratic. Then he robs in a bank, and at that period he feels"
that he is a Liberal and begins to experience vaguely aristocratic
"ideas. If business goes splendidly, the aristocratic ideas get"
crystallized. Then he can come to Rome and go into ecstasies over
"all the humbugs of Catholicism; and after that, one is authorized to"
"acknowledge that the religion of our fathers is a beautiful religion,"

telling you plainly what I know you want to hear. I love only you and am
"true to you in every thought, word, and deed. I long for you, yearn for"
"you, pray for you, and be your fortune good or ill, I would share it and"
give you a part of the bliss of life which you would give to me.
"""So I pray you, do not desert me in case your present hope of good"
"fortune fails you, but let me know at any time, and I will go to you, and"
will go with you wherever you will take me.
"""You will say, I fear, that none but a crazy woman would write such a"
"letter as this, but if that be true, the world doubtless is and always"
"has been populated by maniacs, and I pray God always will be. I pray you,"
"remember, in judging me, that you are you and that I am but a woman"
by whom the good or evil of life is reckoned in the measure of her love;
her joy or misery being only a matter of down weight or light weight more
"in the love she gives than in that which she receives. Remember, also,"
"that in this letter I must condense when I might easily be prolix, and"
"that after all is written, probably I shall have left unsaid the very"
thing I most wished to say. But these three words will tell it all and
bear repeating: I love you.
"""FRANCES."""
And this from my sensible cousin! What would it be if her heart were not
balanced by a wise head?
"Our letters being written, I became alarmed about posting them in London,"
"not knowing when a messenger would start for France, nor who he would be."
"The next day Frances and I talked it over, and she suggested that as the"
"king and most of the court were about to visit Bath for a season, and as"
"It was vital to stop this lying but insidious propaganda, and the"
first step was to prevent German agents from entering India at all.
To do this the nomad tribes of the Sarhad must be brought back into
line with their old policy of friendship with Britain. Hence my
orders from General Kirkpatrick.
He instructed me to proceed without a moment's unnecessary delay to
"Quetta, where I was to receive more detailed instructions."
"On leaving him I hurried, with car and native chauffeur, to the"
"railway station, and asked for a truck on which to place the car"
for entrainment to Nushki. The station-master assured me I was
"asking for an impossibility. A great Maharajah, then travelling, had"
"commandeered every available truck for his suite, luggage and cars."
I told him that the Government business on which I had been sent was
"all important, and, by a little persuasion, soon had myself on the"
way to Pindi and the car on the way to Nushki.
Arrived at Pindi I found I had exactly one hour left in which to
"catch the train for Quetta. There was no time to pack, sort out kit,"
"or decide what should, or should not, be taken on a campaign which"
"might last only a few weeks or many months, and which might assume"
"a political aspect sooner than expected. My servant, Allah-dad, was"
therefore directed to take everything for sorting out when time could
"be spared, and I rushed off to try and ""do a deal"" with General Sir"
"Gerald Kitson, before starting."
I realised that a motor-car might play an important part in this
"prospective campaign, as it would be necessary to travel for long"
"distances in a land of no railways and no regular roads, the best"
road to be hoped for probably being a sandy track used by camel
caravans. I had already had some experience of difficult motoring
"That, however, despite the largely fanciful character of the entries in"
"the omen texts, these collections not only rested on a firm basis of"
"actual observation, but served a practical purpose is shown by the"
examples that we have of official reports made by the =bârû=-priests of
"human and animal anomalies, with the interpretations attached that"
represent quotations from the collections[21]. A report of this kind in
reference to an animal monstrosity reads in part as follows[22]:
"'If it is a double foetus, but with one head, a double spine, two"
"tails and one body, the land that is now ruled by two will be ruled"
by one person.
"If it is a double foetus with one head, the land will be safe.'"
We have here two quotations from a text furnishing all kinds of
peculiarities connected with a double foetus and we are fortunate in
having the text from which the quotations are made[23]. Evidently an ewe
"has given birth to a monstrosity such as is here described, the case has"
"been reported to the diviners who furnish the king[24] with this report,"
"indicating that since the monstrosity has only one head, what might have"
been an unfavorable omen is converted into a favorable one.
Another report[25] regarding a monstrosity born of a sow reads:
"'If a foetus has eight feet and two tails, the ruler will acquire"
"universal sway. A butcher, Uddanu by name, reported as follows: A sow"
gave birth (to a young) having eight feet and two tails. I have
preserved it in salt and kept it in the house. From
Nergal-eṭir[26].'
Here we have the name of the =bârû=-priest who made the report expressly
"Secondly, passages for sheer interest of content, such as the Trial"
"Scene from “The Merchant of Venice,” or the Forest Scene in “As You"
Like It.”
"Thirdly, for dramatic and historical interest, such as, “Men at some"
"time are masters of their fates,” the whole of Mark Antony's speech,"
and the scene with Imogen and her foster-brothers in the Forest.
It may not be wholly out of place to add here that the children learned
"and repeated these passages themselves, and that I offered them the"
same advice as I do to all Story-tellers. I discussed quite openly
"with them the method I considered best, trying to make them see that"
simplicity of delivery was not only the most beautiful but the most
"effective means to use; and, by the end of a few months, when they"
"had been allowed to experiment and express themselves, they began"
"to see that mere ranting was not force, and that a sense of reserve"
power is infinitely more impressive and inspiring than mere external
presentation.
"I encouraged them to criticise each other for the common good, and"
"sometimes I read a few lines with over-emphasis and too much gesture,"
"which they were at liberty to point out, so that they might avoid the"
same error.
A very good collection of poems for this purpose of narrative is to be
found in:
"Mrs. P. A. Barnett's series of _Song and Story_,"
Published by A. and C. Black.
And for older children:
"""And I,"" retorted Concha, ""am as strictly forbidden to reveal mine to"
"General Cabrera or even to that notable young officer, Colonel Don Rollo"
"of the surname which resembles so much a _borrico's_ serenade!"""
That speech would have been undoubtedly rude save for the glance which
"accompanied it, given softly yet daringly from beneath a jetty fringe of"
eyelash.
Nevertheless all Rollo Blair's pride of ancestry rose insurgent within
him. Who was this Andalucian waiting-maid that she should speak lightly
of the descendant of that Blair of Blair Castle who had stood for Bruce
"and freedom on the field of Bannockburn? It was unbearable--and yet,"
"well, there was something uncommon about this girl. And after all, was"
it not the mark of a gentleman to pay no heed to the babbling of women's
"tongues? If they did not say one thing, they would another. Besides, he"
cared nothing what this girl might say. A parrot prattling in a cage
would affect him as much.
So they rode on together over the great tawny brick-dusty wastes of Old
"Castile, silent mostly, but the silence occasionally broken by speech,"
"friendly enough on either side. Behind them pounded La Giralda, gaunt as"
"the sergeant himself, leather-legginged, booted and spurred, watching"
"them keenly out of her ancient, unfathomable gipsy eyes."
And ever as they rode the Guadarrama mountains rose higher and whiter
"out of the vast and hideous plain, the only interruption to the circling"
horizon of brown and parched corn lands. But at this season scrub-oak
"and juniper were the only shrubs to be seen, and had there been a"
"Cristino outpost anywhere within miles, the party must have been"
discerned riding steadily towards the northern slopes of the mountains.
"But neither man nor beast took notice of them, and a certain large"
uncanny silence brooded over the plain.
"is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat."
But there is a gulf between oneself and them. They have no inkling of
"our crucifixion, our universal consciousness. Each of them is pivoted"
"and limited to himself, as the wild animals are. They look out, and they"
"see other objects, objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously"
"at. But ""thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" has never entered"
"their souls at all, not even the thin end of it. They might love their"
"neighbour, with a hot, dark, unquestioning love. But the love would"
probably leave off abruptly. The fascination of what is beyond them has
not seized on them. Their neighbour is a mere external. Their life is
"centripetal, pivoted inside itself, and does not run out towards others"
"and mankind. One feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life,"
which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside.
"And so they lie about on the seats, play a game, shout, and sleep,"
and settle their long stocking-caps: and spit. It is wonderful in
them that at this time of day they still wear the long stocking-caps
as part of their inevitable selves. It is a sign of obstinate and
powerful tenacity. They are not going to be broken in upon by
world-consciousness. They are not going into the world's common clothes.
"Coarse, vigorous, determined, they will stick to their own coarse dark"
stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened
"hell. Their hell is their own hell, they prefer it unenlightened."
And one cannot help wondering whether Sardinia will resist right
through. Will the last waves of enlightenment and world-unity break over
them and wash away the stocking-caps? Or is the tide of enlightenment
and world-unity already receding fast enough?
"Certainly a reaction is setting in, away from the old universality,"
"back, away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism. Russia, with her"

"As a result of researches in the field of Babylonian-Assyrian divination,"
"now extending over a number of years[1], it may be definitely said that"
"apart from the large class of miscellaneous omens[2], the Babylonians and"
Assyrians developed chiefly three methods of divination into more or less
elaborate systems--divination through the inspection of the liver of a
"sacrificial animal or Hepatoscopy, through the observation of the"
"there is a transposition of ""second"" and ""third"" groups, which the"
"context corrects.) Motley, an inveterate Celtophobe, is at pains to make"
"out that the Walloons rebelled first and were first reconciled to Rome,"
"""exactly like their Celtic ancestors, fifteen centuries earlier."" He"
omits to comment on the fact that it was only the French form of
"Protestantism, that of Calvin, that became viable in the Netherlands at"
"all, or on the fact that indecent Anabaptism flourished mainly in"
Friesland; though he admits that the Lutheran movement left all
"religious rights in the hands of the princes, the people having to"
"follow the creed of their rulers. The ""racial"" explanation is mere"
"obscurantism, here as always. The Walloons of South Flanders were first"
affected simply because they were first in touch with Huguenotism. That
they were never converted in large numbers to Protestantism is later
"admitted by Motley himself (p. 797), who thereupon speaks of the"
"""intense attachment to the Roman ceremonial which distinguished the"
"Walloon population."" Thus his earlier statement that they had rebelled"
"against ""papal Rome"" is admittedly false. They had rebelled simply"
against the Spanish tyranny. Yet the false statement is left
standing--one more illustration of the havoc that may be worked in a
"historian's intelligence by a prejudice. (For other instances see, in"
"the author's volume _The Saxon and the Celt_, the chapters dealing with"
Mommsen and Burton.)
It was the Teutonic-speaking city populations of North Flanders and
Brabant who became Protestants in mass after the troubles had begun
"(Motley, p. 798). When the Walloon provinces withdrew from the"
"combination against Spain, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and"
Ypres joined the Dutch Union of Utrecht. They were one and all reduced
"by the skill and power of Alexander of Parma, who thereupon abolished"
the freedom of Protestant worship. The Protestants fled in thousands to
"England and the Dutch provinces, the remaining population, albeit mostly"
"Teutonic, becoming Catholic. At this moment one-and-a-half of the"
"Marsh's full, red lips went pallid with rage as he said ""Then it is to"
"be war, eh?"""
"""Suit yourself."" Boyd pointed to the shore. ""Your boatman is waiting"
"for you."""
As Marsh made his way to the water's edge he stumbled like a blind man;
"his lips were bleeding where his small, sharp teeth had bitten them,"
and he panted like an hysterical woman.
"During the next fortnight the sailing-ships began to assemble, standing"
in under a great spread of canvas to berth close alongside the two
"steamships; for, once the ice had moved north, there was no further"
"obstacle to their coming, and the harbor was soon livened with puffing"
"tugs, unwieldy lighters, and fleets of smaller vessels. Where, but a"
"short time before, the brooding silence had been undisturbed save for"
"the plaint of wolf-dogs and the lazy voices of natives, a noisy army"
was now at work. The bustle of a great preparation arose; languid
smoke-wreaths began to unfurl above the stacks of the canneries; the
stamp and clank of tin-machines re-echoed; hammer and saw maintained a
never-ceasing hubbub. Down at the new plant scows were being launched
while yet the pitch was warm on their seams; buildings were rising
"rapidly, and a crew had gone up the river to get out a raft of piles."
"On the morning after the arrival of the last ship, Emerson and his"
companions were treated to a genuine surprise. Cherry had come down to
the site as usual--she could not let a day go by without visiting the
"place--and Clyde, after a tardy breakfast, had just come ashore. They"
"were watching Big George direct the launching of a scow, when all of a"
"sudden they heard a familiar voice behind them cry, cheerfully:"
captain--the fellow who had apparently followed Tommy and Monsieur. He
"was a well-built blond, with a bullet-shaped head, high cheek bones and"
"deep set eyes--pig eyes. His right cheek bore several scars which,"
"considering his type, strongly suggested a German of University dueling"
"experiences. So I looked on him with a livelier suspicion, even as she"
seemed to be doing.
In an undertone he now said something that brought the old man to his
"feet. With fear written on their faces they talked for several minutes,"
during which the blond jerked his head once or twice toward the gambling
rooms. The girl had leaned forward watching them intently. Then with a
peremptory order the old one sent him away and sank back into his chair;
"but a moment later, clutching the tablecloth, he spoke a few words that"
made her recoil in evident horror.
"I did not know what to do or what to think, so I merely watched with"
"every sense alert. I saw him call the waiter for his settlement, I saw"
him take out a large roll of money and with trembling fingers peel off
the outside bill--a new and crinkly fifty-dollar note. I saw the girl
"idly marking on the winecard with a small gold pencil, though her eyes"
were veiling an intense excitement; and when the waiter returned with a
"pile of change which the old man began to count, I saw her furtively"
slip the winecard to her lap. A moment later it fell to the floor as she
arose to leave.
"Together they started toward the exit, but having taken a few steps she"
"left him with a brief word and returned, presumably for her glove."
"Partially free from his eternal vigilance, she raised her eyes without"
"dissimulation and looked quickly, appealingly into mine; then down at"
"her hand, on which she leaned, whose fingers were unfolding from a"
little ball of paper. Again into my eyes she looked--a look of infinite
appeal.
_déjeuner_ and of dry bread and octopus soup for dinner soon changed my
outlook upon life. Little wonder then if these folk after six weeks of
such treatment were nervous and excitable.
Such was the condition of body and mind in which they attended the
"long service of Good Friday night. Service I have said, but drama"
"were a more fitting word, a funeral-drama. At the top of the nave,"
"just below the chancel-step, stood a bier and upon it lay the figure"
"of the Christ, all too death-like in the dim light. The congregation"
"gaze upon him, reverently hushed, while the priests’ voices rise in"
prayer and chant as it were in lamentation for the dead God lying
there in state. Hour after hour passes. The women have kissed the
"dead form, and are gone. The moment has come for carrying the Christ"
"out to burial. The procession moves forward--in front, the priests"
"with candles and torches and, guarded by them, the open bier borne"
"shoulder-high--behind, a reverent, bare-headed crowd. The night is"
"dark and gusty. It rains, and the rugged, tortuous alleys of the town"
"are slippery. It is late, but none are sleeping. Unheeding of wind"
"and rain, the women kneel at open door or window, praying, swinging"
"censers, sprinkling perfume on the passing bier. Slowly, haltingly, led"
"by the dirge of priests, now in darkness, now lighted by the torches’"
"flare and intermittent beams from cottage doorways, groping at corners,"
"stumbling in ill-paved by-ways, the mourners follow their God to his"
grave. The circuit of the town is done. All have taken their last look
upon the dead. The sepulchre is reached--a vault beneath the church
from which the funeral started. The priests alone enter with the bier.
"There is a pause. The crowd waits. The silence is deep as the darkness,"
only broken here and there by a deep-drawn sigh. Is it the last depth
"of anguish, or is it well-nigh relief that the long strain is over?"
"The priests return. In silence the crowd have waited, in silence they"
disperse. It is finished.
"But the finest growth of the new literature, it turns out, is due to"
"culture-contacts--an unexpected confirmation, in a most unlikely"
"quarter, of a general principle arrived at on other data. The vigilant"
"study of our own day has detected, standing out from the early"
"Icelandic literature, ""a group of poems which possess the very qualities"
"of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature, passionate"
"dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language, which [other] Icelandic"
poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at
"all. They are the poetry of the 'Western Islands'""[688]--that is, the"
"poetry of the meeting and mixing of the ""Celtic"" and Scandinavian stocks"
"in Ireland and the Hebrides--the former already much mixed, and"
proportionally rich in intellectual variations. It was in this area that
"""a magnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for"
power and beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries
"after their date.... This school, which is totally distinct from the"
"Icelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the thirteenth"
"century.""[689]"
"Compare Messrs. Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_,"
"1883, vol. i, Introd. pp. lxii, lxiii; and, as regards the old"
"Irish civilisation, the author's _Saxon and Celt_, pp. 127, 128,"
131-33.
"The theory of Celtic influence, though established in its"
"essentials, is not perfectly consistent as set forth in the"
"_Britannica_ article. Thus, while the Celticised literature is"
"remarked for ""noble simplicity of language,"" the true Icelandic,"
"primarily like the Old English, is said to develop a ""complexity of"
"structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical"
"phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,"
"quantity, and syllabification which it caught up from the Latin and"
"_Celtic_ poets."" Further, while the Celticised school is described"
"performed. Appendix incision, about [Symbol: ounce]j of fæcal"
fluid and fæces in a localised cavity on outer and anterior
aspect of cæcum evacuated; adhesions very firm. Cavity sloughy
throughout and cæcum covered with dull grey lymph. The opening
"in the bowel was not localised, and it was considered wiser to"
treat the case like one of perforation from appendicitis than
to run the risk of breaking down adhesions. A small awl-like
opening was found in the ilium with powdered bone at its
entrance leading to the wound of exit.
"The after-treatment of the case gave rise to no anxiety, but"
healing of the resulting sinus was slow; fæcal-smelling pus
"escaped for some days, and a number of small sloughs came away."
"On the twelfth day the patient was sent down to Wynberg, where"
he remained twelve weeks. A counter-incision was needed in the
loin to drain the suppurating cavity three weeks after the
"primary operation, and five weeks after the operation an escape"
"of gas and fæces took place from the anterior wound, while the"
"bowels were acting, as a result of a dose of castor oil. No"
"further escape of fæces occurred, and he left for England with"
a small sinus only. No extension of inflammation into the
"original wound track ever occurred, both openings and the canal"
healing by primary union.
"The sinus remained open, and occasionally discharged for a"
"further period of six months, and then healed firmly; since"
when the patient has been in perfect health.
"(182*) _Splenic flexure, descending colon._--Wounded at"
"Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), in sixth left intercostal"
"space in mid-axillary line; _exit_, in left loin, below last"
"rib, at outer margin of erector spinæ. The patient remained in"
just see by the night-light's glow.  The afternoon had shaken her nerves.
Nor was Betty's method of breathing while asleep conducive to the slumber
"of anything but babies.  It was so hot, too, and the sound of the violin"
"still in her ears.  By that little air of Poise, she had known for"
certain it was Fiorsen; and her father's abrupt drawing of the curtains
"had clinched that certainty.  If she had gone to the window and seen him,"
she would not have been half so deeply disturbed as she was by that echo
of an old emotion.  The link which yesterday she thought broken for good
was reforged in some mysterious way.  The sobbing of that old fiddle had
"been his way of saying, ""Forgive me; forgive!""  To leave him would have"
been so much easier if she had really hated him; but she did not.
"However difficult it may be to live with an artist, to hate him is quite"
as difficult.  An artist is so flexible--only the rigid can be hated.
"She hated the things he did, and him when he was doing them; but"
"afterward again could hate him no more than she could love him, and that"
was--not at all.  Resolution and a sense of the practical began to come
"back with daylight.  When things were hopeless, it was far better to"
recognize it and harden one's heart.
"Winton, whose night had been almost as sleepless--to play like a beggar"
"in the street, under his windows, had seemed to him the limit!--announced"
"at breakfast that he must see his lawyer, make arrangements for the"
"payment of Fiorsen's debts, and find out what could be done to secure Gyp"
against persecution.  Some deed was probably necessary; he was vague on
"all such matters.  In the meantime, neither Gyp nor the baby must go out."
"Gyp spent the morning writing and rewriting to Monsieur Harmost, trying"
"to express her chagrin, but not saying that she had left Fiorsen."
Her father came back from Westminster quiet and angry.  He had with
"difficulty been made to understand that the baby was Fiorsen's property,"
"so that, if the fellow claimed it, legally they would be unable to"
"resist.  The point opened the old wound, forced him to remember that his"
"wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him"
kindly into the bargain.
"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas"
than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. And immediately
"after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and"
"he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet"
"been. Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was"
covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the
place where he had first been. And they were much needed; for there were
"a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had"
first seen.
"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred"
"dollars for her, and that without any haggling. But when he had sailed"
"off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. And the"
"storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in"
"which he had never been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the"
table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a
"half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that"
"they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for"
"there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. Only with toil and trouble"
could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a
"while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. Then the cat"
"was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace."
They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a
long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her
"for three hundred dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him, and"
blessed him into the bargain.
"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the"
"boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ""Well, he"
trees.  Her mind was a whirl of impressions--Daphne Wing's figure against
"the door, Mr. Wagge's puggy grey-bearded countenance, the red"
"pampas-grass, the blue bowl, Rosek's face swooping at her, her last"
glimpse of her baby asleep under the trees!
"She reached Kensington Gardens, turned into that walk renowned for the"
"beauty of its flowers and the plainness of the people who frequent it,"
"and sat down on a bench.  It was near the luncheon-hour; nursemaids,"
"dogs, perambulators, old gentlemen--all were hurrying a little toward"
their food.  They glanced with critical surprise at this pretty young
"woman, leisured and lonely at such an hour, trying to find out what was"
"wrong with her, as one naturally does with beauty--bow legs or something,"
"for sure, to balance a face like that!  But Gyp noticed none of them,"
except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing.  For
"months she had resolutely cultivated insensibility, resolutely refused to"
"face reality; the barrier was forced now, and the flood had swept her"
"away.  ""Proceedings!"" Mr. Wagge had said.  To those who shrink from"
"letting their secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends, the"
"notion of a public exhibition of troubles simply never comes, and it had"
certainly never come to Gyp.  With a bitter smile she thought: 'I'm
"better off than she is, after all!  Suppose I loved him, too?  No, I"
never--never--want to love.  Women who love suffer too much.'
She sat on that bench a long time before it came into her mind that she
was due at Monsieur Harmost's for a music lesson at three o'clock.  It
was well past two already; and she set out across the grass.  The summer
"day was full of murmurings of bees and flies, cooings of blissful"
"pigeons, the soft swish and stir of leaves, and the scent of lime blossom"
"under a sky so blue, with few white clouds slow, and calm, and full.  Why"
"be unhappy?  And one of those spotty spaniel dogs, that have broad heads,"
"with frizzy topknots, and are always rascals, smelt at her frock and"
"moved round and round her, hoping that she would throw her sunshade on"
"important) of the reigning beauties of the gay world, Grey felt that it"
would indeed be impossible to speak in this company of any of those
"things which were in his mind.  He contented himself by standing aloof,"
"looking out of the window and sipping his chocolate, whilst the gay"
"flood of talk surged around him, and he caught a word here and a phrase"
"there, but always heard when Lord Sandford’s resonant tones dominated"
those of all others.
"""Talk of rival beauties; we shall see sport to-night.  Lady Romaine and"
Lady Saltire—dearest friends and dearest foes—are to go to Vauxhall
"Gardens to-night, each in a new toilet specially designed and ordered"
"for the occasion.  It will be a ladies’ battle, in very truth; and"
public opinion must needs decide which of the rival queens is fairest to
"look upon.  I have promised both the dear creatures to be there, to give"
my admiration to both alike. Shall I risk the undying enmity of either
"by giving the palm to one?  No such fool, gentlemen—no such fool is"
Sandford.  I vow I will have ready such a pretty speech or couplet for
"each that she shall go away with a better opinion of me than ever!  Ha,"
"ha, ha!  I love to see the pretty dears, tricked out in their finery,"
"and ready to tear each other’s eyes out!  So, gentlemen, I cancel all"
"previous engagements for to-night.  I am for Vauxhall, and Heaven only"
"knows how late we shall be detained there by the battle of beauty."""
"""We will all be there!"" cried the young bloods, who were at all times"
ready to follow Lord Sandford to whatever place of entertainment he
"elected to go; and one voice followed with a laughing question,—"
"""Will the snow maiden be there in the train of her mother?"""
"Grey felt himself start, and was glad his face was turned away.  He"
would not for worlds that the sharp mocking eyes of Lord Sandford should
"see him at this moment, albeit he had no notion of any sort that he had"
"that fate which should transform it into a chaos of rotting remains,"
and finally into dust.
"The gates were open, one half of them displaced and lying on the ground"
"at the entrance, while between its bars had grown the grass, which also"
covered the large and empty court-yard.  In the depths of this yard
"stood a low, iron-roofed, smoke-begrimed building.  The house itself"
"was of course unoccupied, but this shed, formerly a blacksmith's forge,"
"was now turned into a ""dosshouse,"" kept by a retired Captain named"
Aristid Fomich Kuvalda.
"In the interior of the dosshouse was a long, wide and grimy board,"
measuring some 28 by 70 feet.  The room was lighted on one side by four
"small square windows, and on the other by a wide door.  The unpainted"
"brick walls were black with smoke, and the ceiling, which was built of"
"timber, was almost black.  In the middle stood a large stove, the"
"furnace of which served as its foundation, and around this stove and"
"along the walls were also long, wide boards, which served as beds for"
"the lodgers.  The walls smelt of smoke, the earthen floor of dampness,"
and the long wide board of rotting rags.
"The place of the proprietor was on the top of the stove, while the"
boards surrounding it were intended for those who were on good terms
with the owner and who were honoured by his friendship.  During the day
"the captain passed most of his time sitting on a kind of bench, made by"
"himself by placing bricks against the wall of the courtyard, or else in"
"the eating house of Egor Vavilovitch, which was opposite the house,"
where he took all his meals and where he also drank vodki.
"Before renting this house, Aristid Kuvalda had kept a registry office"
for servants in the town.  If we look further back into his former
"life, we shall find that he once owned printing works, and previous to"
"I do not know if this be a paradox, I know that it is a truth."
There was one point that puzzled me for a time in some of these stories
"of transmigration, such as the one I told about the man and wife being"
"reborn twins. It was this: A man dies and leaves behind children, let us"
"say, to whom he is devoutly attached. He is reborn in another family in"
"the same village, maybe. It would be natural to suppose that he would"
"love his former family as much as, or even more than, his new one."
Complications might arise in this way which it is easy to conceive would
cause great and frequent difficulties.
"I explained this to a Burman one day, and asked him what happened, and"
"this is what he said: 'The affection of mother to son, of husband to"
"wife, of brother to sister, belongs entirely to the body in which you"
"may happen to be living. When it dies, so do these affections. New"
"affections arise from the new body. The flesh of the son, being of one"
"with his father, of course loves him; but as his present flesh has no"
"sort of connection with his former one, he does not love those to whom"
he was related in his other lives. These affections are as much a part
of the body as the hand or the eyesight; with one you put off the
other.'
"Thus all love, to the learned, even the purest affection of daughter to"
"mother, of man to his friend, is in theory a function of the body--with"
"the one we put off the other; and this may explain, perhaps, something"
"of what my previous chapter did not make quite clear, that in the"
hereafter[2] of Buddhism there is no affection.
"When we have put off all bodies, when we have attained Nirvana, love and"
"hate, desire and repulsion, will have fallen from us for ever."
"Meanwhile, in each life, we are obliged to endure the affections of the"
"the appreciation of the best qualities of the hero: his modesty, his"
"dignity, his reticence, his courage and his constancy: he seems to"
combine all the qualities of the best soldier with those of the best
"civilian, without the more obvious qualities which generally attract"
"first. As for the love-story, we must not _expect_ any child to see"
"its tenderness and beauty, though the individual child may intuitively"
"appreciate these qualities, but it is not what we wish for or work for"
at this period of child-life.
This method could be applied to various stories. I have chosen the _Tin
Soldier_ because of its dramatic qualities and because it is marked off
(probably quite unconsciously on the part of Andersen) into periods
which correspond to the child's development.
In Eugene Field's exquisite little poem of “The Dinkey Bird” we find
"the objects familiar to the child in _unusual_ places, so that some"
imagination is needed to realise that “big red sugar-plums are clinging
to the cliffs beside that sea”; but the introduction of the fantastic
bird and the soothing sound of the Amfalula Tree are new and delightful
"sensations, quite out of the child's personal experience."
Another such instance is to be found in Mrs. W. K. Clifford's story of
"Master Willie. The abnormal behaviour of familiar objects, such as a"
"doll, leads from the ordinary routine to the paths of adventure. This"
"story is to be found in a little book called “Very Short Stories,” a"
most interesting collection for teachers and children.
"We now come to the second element we should seek in material--namely,"
"the element of the unusual, which we have already anticipated in the"
story of the Tin Soldier.
This element is necessary in response to the demand of the child who
"the poor fisherman of Galilee.... Hence one can gaze up into the dome,"
with its huge letters in purple-blue mosaic upon a gold ground (each
"six feet long)--Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram ædificabo ecclesiam"
"meam, et tibi dabo claves regni coelorum.' Above this are four colossal"
mosaics of the Evangelists.... The pen of St. Luke is seven feet in
"length."""
But we must not permit ourselves to be diverted from our proper subject
"by the vastness and splendor of the building, natural as it is to do"
so when standing under this matchless dome. The four huge piers which
support the dome are used as shrines for the four great relics of the
"church, viz.: 1. The lance of St. Longinus, the soldier who pierced the"
Saviour's side; 2. A portion of the true cross; 3. The napkin of St.
"Veronica, containing the miraculous impression of our Lord's face; and"
4. The head of the apostle Andrew.
"I did not see these relics myself, as I was in the East when they were"
"exhibited, but on April 11th, the day before Easter, other members of"
"my party did, that is, they saw all of them but Andrew's head, and"
from a letter written me by the youngest of my correspondents in my
"own family, giving not only description, but drawings of the spear"
"head, the cross and the handkerchief in their several frames, I infer"
"that, notwithstanding the great height of the Veronica balcony from"
"which they are exhibited, my young correspondent and his companions"
fared better in the matter of a good view than Fritz in _Chronicles
"of the Schönberg Cotta Family_, who says: ""To-day we gazed on the"
Veronica--the holy impression left by our Saviour's face on the cloth
"S. Veronica presented to him to wipe his brow, bowed under the weight"
"of the cross. We had looked forward to this sight for days, for seven"
thousand years of indulgence from penance are attached to it. But when
the moment came we could see nothing but a black board hung with a
"cloth, before which another white cloth was held. In a few minutes this"
will touch his soul or disturb the image he has made of himself. The
attitude of warding off reveals itself as fastidiousness and as
bashfulness. Budaeus hit the mark when he exclaimed jocularly:
'_Fastidiosule!_ You little fastidious person!' Erasmus himself
interprets the dominating trait of his being as maidenly coyness. The
excessive sensitiveness to the stain attaching to his birth results from
"it. But his friend Ammonius speaks of his _subrustica verecundia_, his"
"somewhat rustic _gaucherie_. There is, indeed, often something of the"
"small man about Erasmus, who is hampered by greatness and therefore"
"shuns the great, because, at bottom, they obsess him and he feels them"
to be inimical to his being.
It seems a hard thing to say that genuine loyalty and fervent
gratefulness were strange to Erasmus. And yet such was his nature. In
characters like his a kind of mental cramp keeps back the effusions of
"the heart. He subscribes to the adage: 'Love so, as if you may hate one"
"day, and hate so, as if you may love one day'. He cannot bear benefits."
In his inmost soul he continually retires before everybody. He who
"considers himself the pattern of simple unsuspicion, is indeed in the"
"highest degree suspicious towards all his friends. The dead Ammonius,"
"who had helped him so zealously in the most delicate concerns, is not"
"secure from it. 'You are always unfairly distrustful towards me,'"
"Budaeus complains. 'What!' exclaims Erasmus, 'you will find few people"
who are so little distrustful in friendship as myself.'
When at the height of his fame the attention of the world was indeed
"fixed on all he spoke or did, there was some ground for a certain"
feeling on his part of being always watched and threatened. But when he
"was yet an unknown man of letters, in his Parisian years, we continually"
find traces in him of a mistrust of the people about him that can only
be regarded as a morbid feeling. During the last period of his life this
"feeling attaches especially to two enemies, Eppendorf and Aleander."
"the pearl was afterward sold in Paris for $12,000 it is quite evident"
"that the share of the middleman, of whom political economists just now"
"talk so much, was heavy. The Panama pearls are sometimes of beautiful"
"colors, green, pale blue and a delicate pink. On the Chiriqui coast a"
"year or two ago a pearl weighing about forty-two carats, about the size"
"and shape of a partridge egg, greenish black at the base and shading to"
"a steel gray at the tip, was found. It was sold in Paris for $5000."
"[Illustration: A DAY’S SHOOTING, GAME MOSTLY MONKEYS]"
It is a curious fact that the use of mussels from our western rivers is
one cause for the decadence of the Panama pearl industry. For years the
actual expense of maintaining these fisheries was met by the sale of the
shell for use in making buttons and mother-of-pearl ornaments. The
"pearls represented the profit of the enterprise, which was always"
therefore more or less of a gamble--but a game in which it was
"impossible to lose, though the winnings might be great or small"
according to luck. Now that the demand for pearl oyster shells has
"fallen off, owing to the competition of mussels, the chances in the game"
are rather against the player and the sport languishes.
[Illustration: THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOL OF HAT MAKING]
[Illustration: BEGINNING A PANAMA HAT]
The authorities of the Republic are making some effort to establish a
system of industrial schools which may lead to the fuller utilization of
the natural resources of the country. Every tourist who visits the
Isthmus is immediately taught by one who has been there a day or two
longer than he that Panama hats are not made in Panama. This seems to
be the most precious information that anyone on the Zone has to impart.
Most of the hats there sold are indeed made in Ecuador and the name
ensure his overthrow and defeat; and Grey had his suspicions that Lord
Sandford had hoped that he might then and there break his neck—a thing
which might very well have happened.
"There was a crowd round the spot now, and great horror was expressed by"
"many at sight of the unsuspected well, no voice being louder than Lord"
Sandford’s in proclaiming astonishment and indignation. But Grey took no
"notice of the clamour, only busying himself about his horse; and"
"presently, with some difficulty, the sagacious and docile creature was"
"got out, and it appeared that no limb was broken, though one hock was"
"deeply cut, and one shoulder badly strained."
"Grey stood in silent thought awhile, his hand upon the neck of his"
"favourite, who stood with drooping head and dejected mien, as though"
wondering whether he would ever be whole and sound again.  Dick was
"binding up the wound, his face like a thunder-cloud. A knot of persons"
of all ranks stood watching at a little distance; but Grey had
"courteously waved away all proffers of help, and indicated that he"
desired no attentions.
"""Dicon,"" he said in a low tone, ""we must now part for a while.  Don"
"Carlos will need you more than I.  He is now my sole fortune, and must"
"be respected as such.  Take him and your own nag, and walk them both by"
"easy stages to Hartsbourne. There are paddocks enough and to spare, and"
I surely have the right to pasture my horse in one; but if the thing
"should come to my kinsman’s ears, give him what is due in money, and I"
will repay you.  Old Jock Jarvis will be your friend.  He will rejoice
"in your company and give you house-room with him, and it is not so far"
but that I can get news of you from time to time.  Your good horse will
bring you to London in three hours or less any day you have a mind to
"come; and you can watch for me what goes on yonder, and bring me word"
"again."""
"dined quite cheerfully on dry bread and water, if any one would have"
listened to his stories of the wonders of his past life or the yet more
wonderful achievements of his future. He would have sat and spun yarns
"concerning the notches on Killiecrankie at a dyke-back, though he had"
"not tasted food for twenty-four hours, with the utmost composure and"
"relish. But his companions were of another kidney, being all valiant"
"trencher-men--John Mortimer desiring chiefly quantity in his eating,"
"while Etienne, no mean cook himself, desiderated rather variety and"
delicacy in the dishes which were set before him.
"At all events the dinner was a great success, though the Sergeant, who"
"evinced the greatest partiality for Rollo, often reproached him with"
"eating little, or inquired anxiously if the sauce of a certain dish"
"were not to his taste. Rollo, in the height of his argument, would"
"hastily affirm that it was delicious, and be off again in chase of some"
"deed of arms or daring, leaving the Sergeant's _chef-d'oeuvre_"
untasted on his plate.
At this the Sergeant shook his head in private to El Sarria.
"""It will stand in his way, I fear me,"" he said sententiously; ""was there"
ever a notable general yet who had not a fine belly to wag before him
upon horseback? 'Tis as necessary as the cock's feathers in his hat. Now
there is your cut-and-thrust officer who is good for nothing but to be
first in charges and to lead forlorn hopes--this colonel of yours is
just the figure for him. I have seen many a dozen of them get the lead
between their ribs and never regretted it before. But it is a devil's
pity that this young cockerel is not fonder of his dinner. How regardeth
"he the women?"""
"This last question was asked anxiously, yet with some hope. But this"
also El Sarria promptly scattered to the winds.
The thoughtful traveler will concede to the Republic of Panama great
natural resources and a most happy entrance to the family of nations. It
is the especial protégé of the United States and under the watchful care
"of its patron will be free from the apprehension of misuse, revolution"
or invasion from without which has kept other Central American
governments in a constant state of unrest. About the international
morality of the proceedings which created the relations now existing
between the United States and Panama perhaps the least said the better.
"But even if we reprobate the sale of Joseph by his brethren, in the"
"scripture story, we must at least admit that he did better in Egypt than"
in his father’s house and that the protection and favor of the mighty
"Pharaoh was of the highest advantage to him, and in time to his"
unnatural brethren as well.
[Illustration: WORK OF INDIAN STUDENTS IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE]
"At present the Republic suffers not only from its own checkered past,"
but from the varied failings of its neighbors. Its monetary system
"affords one illustration. The highest coin of the land is the peso, a"
piece the size of our silver dollar but circulating at a value of fifty
cents. If a man should want to pay a debt of $500 he would have to
deliver 1000 pesos unless he was possessed of a bank account and could
settle by check. No paper money is issued. “Who would take paper money
issued by a Central American republic?” ask the knowing ones scornfully
when you inquire about this seeming lack in the monetary system. Yet the
"Republic of Panama is the most solvent of nations, having no national"
debt and with money in bank.
[Illustration: THE CRATER OF THE CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]
Probably the one obstacle to the progress of the Republic to greatness
Perhaps it may be as well to turn aside from the orderly and informative
discussion of the statistics of the Zone to expand a little further here
upon the remarkable matrimonial phenomena it presented in its halcyon
"days--for it must be remembered that even as I am writing, that society,"
"which I found so hospitable and so admirable, has begun to disintegrate."
"Marriage, it must be admitted, is a somewhat cosmopolitan passion. It"
attacks spiggotty and gringo alike. In an earlier chapter I have
described how the low cost of living enabled Miguel of the Chagres
country to set up a home of his own. Let us consider how the benevolent
arrangements made by the Isthmian Canal Commission impelled a typical
American boy to the same step.
Probably it was more a desire for experience and adventure than any idea
of increased financial returns that led young Jack Maxon to seek a job
in engineering on the Canal. Graduated from the engineering department
"of a State university, with two years or so of active experience in the"
"field, Jack was a fair type of young American--clean, wholesome,"
"healthy, technically trained, ambitious for his future but quite"
"solicitious about the pleasures of the present, as becomes a youth of"
twenty-three.
[Illustration: MAIN STREET AT GORGONA]
The job he obtained seemed at the outset quite ideal. In the States he
could earn about $225 a month. The day he took his number on the Canal
Zone he began to draw $250 a month. And that $250 was quite as good as
"$300 at home. To begin with he had no room-rent to pay, but was assigned"
"comfortable if not elegant quarters, which he shared with one other man;"
"carefully screened and protected from all insects by netting, lighted by"
"electricity, with a shower-bath handy and all janitor or chambermaid"
service free. Instead of a boarding-house table or a cheap city
"Herrick, who studied his own dreams for many months, found that the"
"essential element is the emotional, and not the ideational, and that,"
"indeed, when recalled _at once_, with closed eyes and before moving,"
they were nearly devoid of intellectual content (_Journal of Comparative
"Neurology_, vol. iii. p. 17, 1893). R. MacDougall considers that dreaming"
is 'a succession of intense states of feeling supported by a minimum of
"ideational content,' or, as he says again, more accurately, 'the feeling"
is primary; the idea-content is the inferred thing' (_Psychological
"Review_, vol. v. p. 2). Grace Andrews, who kept a record of her dreams"
"(_American Journal of Psychology_, October 1900), found that dream"
emotions are often stronger and more vivid than those of waking life; 'the
dream emotion seems to me the most real element of the dream life.' P.
"Meunier, again ('Des Rêves Stéreotypés,' _Journal de Psychologie Normale"
"et Pathologique_, September-October 1905), states that 'the substratum of"
a dream consists of a cœnæsthesia or an emotional state. The intellectual
"operation which translates to the sleeper's consciousness, while he is"
"asleep, this cœnæsthesia or emotional state is what we call a dream.']"
[Footnote 88: The night-terrors of children have frequently been found
to have their origin in gastric or intestinal disturbance. Graham Little
"brings together the opinions of various authorities on this point,"
though he is himself inclined to give chief importance to heart disease
"producing slight disturbances of breathing, since he has found that"
in nearly two-thirds of his cases (17 out of 30) night-terrors were
"associated with early heart disease (Graham Little, 'The Causation of"
"Night-Terrors,' _British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899). It should"
be added that night-terrors are more usually divided into two classes:
"(1) idiopathic (purely cerebral in origin), and (2) symptomatic (due to"
"reflex disturbance caused by various local disorders); see _e.g._ Guthrie,"
"'On Night-Terrors,' _Clinical Journal_, 7th January 1899. J. A. Symonds"
"has well described his own night-terrors as a child (Horatio Brown, _J."
"A. Symonds_, vol. i.). Lafcadio Hearn (in a paper on 'Nightmare-Touch'"
"gnashing of teeth ... save your teeth, or else you will not be able to"
protect yourself.  Here are twenty kopecks.  Go and buy a bottle of
"vodki for five kopecks, hot tripe or lungs, one pound of bread and two"
cucumbers.  When we have lived off our drunken headache we will think
"of the condition of affairs ..."""
"As a rule the consideration of the ""condition of affairs"" lasted some"
"two or three days, and only when the Captain had not a farthing left of"
the three roubles or five roubles given him by his grateful customer
did he say:
"""You came!  Do you see?  Now that we have drunk everything with you,"
"you fool, try again to regain the path of virtue and soberness.  It has"
"been truly said that if you do not sin, you will not repent, and, if"
"you do not repent, you shall not be saved.  We have done the first, and"
to repent is useless.  Let us make direct for salvation.  Go to the
"river and work, and if you think you cannot control yourself, tell the"
"contractor, your employer, to keep your money, or else give it to me."
"When you get sufficient capital, I will get you a pair of trousers and"
other things necessary to make you seem a respectable and hard-working
"man, persecuted by fate.  With decent-looking trousers you can go far."
"Now then, be off!"""
"Then the client would go to the river to work as a porter, smiling the"
while over the Captain's long and wise speeches. He did not distinctly
"understand them, but only saw in front of him two merry eyes, felt"
"their encouraging influence, and knew that in the loquacious Captain he"
had an arm that would assist him in time of need.
"And really it happened very often that, for a month or so, some"
"ticket-of-leave client, under the strict surveillance of the Captain,"
had the opportunity of raising himself to a condition better than that
“This would be lessening the joy of the world and taking from
"generations yet unborn the capacity for wonder, the power to take a"
"large unselfish interest in the spectacle of things, and putting them"
forever at the mercy of small private cares.
"A Nursery Rhyme is the most sane, the most unselfish thing in the"
"world. It calls up some delightful image,--a little nut-tree with a"
silver walnut and a golden pear; some romantic adventure only for the
child's delight and liberation from the bondage of unseeing dulness: it
brings before the mind the quintessence of some good thing:
'The little dog laughed to see such sport'--there is the soul of
"good humour, of sanity, of health in the laughter of that innocently"
wicked little dog. It is the laughter of pure frolic without
unkindness. To have laughed with the little dog as a child is the best
preservative against mirthless laughter in later years--the horse
"laughter of brutality, the ugly laughter of spite, the acrid laughter"
"of fanaticism. The world of Nursery Rhymes, the old world of Mrs."
"Slipper-Slopper, is the world of natural things, of quick, healthy"
"motion, of the joy of living."
In Nursery Rhymes the child is entertained with all the pageant of
"the world. It walks in Fairy Gardens, and for it the singing birds"
pass. All the King's horses and all the King's men pass before it in
"their glorious array. Craftsmen of all sorts, bakers, confectioners,"
"silversmiths, blacksmiths are busy for it with all their arts and"
"mysteries, as at the court of an Eastern King.”"
"In insisting on the value of this escape from the commonplace, I cannot"
prove the importance of it more clearly than by showing what may happen
to a child who is deprived of his birthright by having none of the
"ledge, while his body caught in the bushes, hung a moment, then dashed"
after its comrades below.
"Just then the end of a rope fell dangling by their side, let down from"
"the ramparts above. The duke tried to grasp it, but it shifted beyond"
"the gap. Down the rope came a man, then another; they both gained a"
"foothold on the narrow ledge. No sooner were their feet on it, than"
the duke sent them headlong to the bottom. Then grasping the rope
"without waiting to see if a third or fourth were coming down, he"
"shouted to Francesco to follow. Perilous as was the task, it was no"
"more so than to follow the steep and narrow goat's trail, and in a"
brief space of time they swung into a courtyard which was deserted.
"Anticipating no attack on this side, the defenders of Astura had"
"turned their whole attention to the southern slope, where the Pisans"
were scaling the walls. The roar of the conflict seemed to grow with
"the roar of the hurricane, and, as one by one the duke's men leaped"
"into the dark square, and the muster was complete, Count Rupert turned"
to Francesco.
"""I feared lest they might clean out the nest before our arrival,"" he"
"said, then, pointing to a distant glare of torches, he gave the word."
They caught the unwary defenders in the rear. No quarter was to be
given; the robber brood of Astura was to be exterminated.
"""Conradino!"" was the password, and above the taunts and cries of"
"Frangipani's hirelings it filled the night with its clamor, rode on"
"the wings of the storm, like the war-cry of a thousand demons."
Notwithstanding the fact that a few of the most daring among the Pisan
"admiral's men had scaled the ramparts and, leaping into the"
"Frangipani's stronghold, had tried to pave a way for those lagging"
"behind, their companions-in-arms were in dire straits. For those of"
"Everywhere the smooth dark trunks converged upon one another, sending"
up a tangle of boughs that glittered in the soft sheen of the
"sunlight. Withered bracken stood in thin silence, and here and there a"
dead bough lay like a snake with its head raised to strike.
"The silence was immense, and yet it was a stillness that suggested"
"sounds. It resembled the silence of a huge cavern, out of which came"
strange whisperings; innumerable crepitations seemed to come from the
"dead leaves. Francesco fancied he could hear the trees breathing, and"
from afar he caught the wild note of a bird.
The sun was low when they came at last to the edge of the forest and
saw a hill rise steeply against the sky. It was covered with silver
"birches, whose stems looked like white threads in the level light of"
the setting sun. And rising against the sky-line from amidst the
fretwork of birch-boughs Francesco saw the well-remembered outlines of
the ruined tower wherein he had spent a memorable night.
"The valley before them was flooded with golden light, and, as they"
"crossed it, Francesco felt a curious desire for physical pain,"
"something fierce and tangible to struggle with, to drown the"
ever-pulsing memory of the woman who had gone from him.
As the dusk deepened they went scrambling up the hillside amid the
"birches, whose white stems glimmered upwards into the blue gloom of"
"the twilight. Francesco's thoughts climbed ahead of him, hurrying to"
deal with the unknown dangers that might be awaiting him. He had to
"dismount, pull his steed after him; but the scramble upwards gave him"
the sense of effort and struggle that he needed. It was like scaling a
"wall to come to grips with an enemy, whose wild eyes and sword-points"
showed between the crenelations.
"appeared before us in a vital form, nothing can really destroy it; it"
"is because things are often given in a blurred, faint light that they"
gradually fade out of our memory. A very keen scientist was deploring
"to me, on one occasion, the fact that stories were told so much in the"
"schools, to the detriment of science, for which she claimed the same"
indestructible element that I recognise in the best-told stories.
"Being very much interested in her point of view, I asked her to tell"
"me, looking back on her school days, what she could remember as"
standing out from other less clear information. After thinking some
"little time over the matter, she said with some embarrassment, but with"
a candour that did her much honour:
"“Well, now I come to think of it, it was the story of Cinderella.”"
"Now, I am not holding any brief for this story in particular. I think"
the reason it was remembered was because of the dramatic form in which
"it was presented to her, which fired her imagination and kept the"
memory alight. I quite realise that a scientific fact might also have
been easily remembered if it was presented in the form of a successful
chemical experiment: but this also has something of the dramatic appeal
and will be remembered on that account.
Sully says: “We cannot understand the fascination of a story for
"children save in remembering that for their young minds, quick to"
"imagine, and unversed in abstract reflection, words are not dead things"
"but _winged_, as the old Greeks called them.”[37]"
The Red Queen (in “Through the Looking-Glass”) was more psychological
than she knew when she made the memorable statement: “When once you've
"_said_ a thing that _fixes_ it, and you must take the consequences.”"

"England, and have accepted of her citizenship--things which I have"
never done--and then in fancied security have spied upon their adopted
"Mother, I loathe and spit upon. I have taken the police oath of"
"obedience to my superiors, and I have kept it, but I have never sworn"
"allegiance to His Majesty your King, whom I pray that God may preserve"
"though I am his enemy. To your blunt English mind, untrained in logic,"
my sentiments and actions may lack consistency. But no. Those agents
"whom we have run down, you and I, were traitors--traitors to England."
Of all traitors for whom Hell is hungry the German-born traitor is the
"most devilish. I would not have you think, my friend, that I am at one"
with them. Never while I have been in your pay and service have I had
any communication direct or indirect with any of the naturalised-
"British Prussian scum, who have betrayed your noble generosity. I have"
"taken my Orders from Vienna, I have communicated always direct with"
Vienna. I am an Austrian naval officer. I am no traitor to England.

I spring from an old Italian family which has long been settled in
Trieste. For many generations we have served in the Austrian Navy.
"With modern Italy, with the Italy above all which has thrown the Holy"
Father into captivity and stripped the Holy See of the dominions
"bestowed upon it by God, we have no part or lot. Yet when I have met"
"Italian officers, and those too of France, as I have frequently done"
"during my cruises afloat, I have felt with them a harmony of spirit"
"supply of granite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building"
materials. Still more valuable are the stores of iron and copper
and other metals which they contain.
At the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior
"leads the world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903"
being more than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole
"United States, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore"
bodies consist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and
"occur in troughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock."
A theory held by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to
the igneous rocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved
"and subjected to weathering, their iron compounds were decomposed."
Their iron was leached out and carried away to be laid in the
Algonkian water bodies in beds of iron carbonate and other iron
"compounds. During the later ages, after the Algonkian strata had"
"been uplifted to form part of the continent, a second"
concentration has taken place. Descending underground waters
charged with oxygen have decomposed the iron carbonate and
"deposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in troughs of the"
strata where their downward progress was arrested by impervious
floors.
The pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich
"in iron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey,"
the black oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and
disseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is
useless.
The pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are
"among the richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next"
"to iron, is the most common of all the useful metals, and it was"
"Viggon Sarri smiled confidently. He glanced at Linus Brein and asked,"
"""Just how competent do you think this new thing is?"""
"Linus shrugged. ""We've analyzed the infrawave pattern they've"
developed. It is obvious that this is their first prototype of an
infrawave space detector. The pattern is of the primitive absorptive
"type, which is both inefficient as a detector and is also inclined to"
"produce spurious responses. From our observations, their equipment"
must be extremely complex too. It must be loaded to the scuppers with
"fragile circuits and components, because the search pattern keeps"
"breaking down, or becoming irregular. An efficient detector cannot"
be made of the infrawave bands until the third order of reflective
"response is discovered. I doubt that any research team, no matter how"
"big, can start with the primitive absorption phase of the infrawaves"
and leap to the higher orders of infrawave radiation in less than a
"lifetime of study."""
"""So, gentlemen?"" asked Viggon of his two aides. ""Can you predict"
"whether or not their new detector will deliver the goods?"""
All looked expectantly at Linus Brein.
"""We've been recalculating our probabilities at the introduction of each"
"new phase of their behaviour,"" Linus Brein said seriously. ""From their"
"actions, I would say that they do not know, grasp, or perhaps even"
guess that space has flaws and warps in the continuum. They have been
"going at their search in a pattern of solid geometrical precision, but"
"have been paying no attention to those rifts, small as they are, that"
actually make a straight course bend aside for a distance. So due to
the fact that their search pattern has already passed over one of these
"rifts in which the one lifeship lies, and passed beyond in their line"
"of the excited Don Carlos, and brought him up to his appointed place"
docile and motionless.
"The word was given, but the black stallion had bounded off a few seconds"
"too soon, and had to be recalled.  A second start was spoiled by two"
"other competitors, who suddenly reared at each other, and strove to"
"fight.  One iron hoof, indeed, inflicted such a wound upon the shoulder"
of his neighbour that that horse had to be taken away limping and
bleeding.
"It was trying to all, horses and riders alike; but at the third start"
"all got off, though Grey saw that again the black stallion had made his"
"bound a second too soon.  This gave him a few yards the advantage,"
"which, as his rider pressed him hard from the first, and his temper was"
"evidently up, he increased in the next minute to more than a length."
"The Arab and Don Carlos were neck and neck, and sailed over the first"
"easy jump side by side, the stallion having cleared it with a tremendous"
bound a couple of seconds earlier.
"The water jump was next, and it was obvious that one spot offered"
greater advantages to the horse than any other.  The stallion made for
"this spot with a rush, took off and bounded clear over, just as Don"
"Carlos and the Arab came rushing up neck and neck, each rider desirous"
of the advantage of the sound bank.  Grey set his teeth and glanced at
"his adversary.  A collision at the leap might be fatal to one or both,"
so far as the race went.  His rival would not budge an inch—that he saw.
"With a muttered oath between his teeth, he pulled his left rein, and"
"used his knees.  Don Carlos felt, and instantly understood: swerving"
"slightly, he gathered himself together, and rose magnificently where the"
"water was wider and the bank less safe; but he landed safely, and with a"
"hardly perceptible scramble found his feet again, and amid the plaudits"
"of the people raced on after the Arab, who, having got a momentary"
more frequent lightnings he saw that it was drawn and gray.
"""There lies his lair,"" the duke pointed to the white masonry of"
"Astura, as it loomed out of the night, menacing and spectral, as a"
"thunderbolt hissed into the sea, and again lapsed into gloom."
"""Betrayer of God and man,--his hour is at hand!""--"
"The duke's beard fairly bristled as he uttered these words, and he"
gripped the hilt of his sword as if he anticipated a conflict with
"some wild beast of the forest, some mythical monster born of night and"
crime.
Francesco made no reply. He was bowed down beneath the gloom of the
"hour, oppressed with unutterable forebodings. He too had an account to"
"settle: yet, whichever way the tongue inclined in the scales, life"
stretched out from him as a sea at night. He dared not think of
"Ilaria, far away in the convent of San Nicandro by the sea; yet her"
"memory had haunted him all day, knocked at the gates of his"
"consciousness, dominated the hours. Compared with the ever present"
"sense of her loss, all in life seemed utterly trifling, and he longed"
for annihilation only.
Yet a kindred note which he sounded in the duke's soul found him in a
more receptive mood for the latter's confidences; once life had
"seemed good to him; he had thought men heroes, the world a faerie"
"place. Thoughts had changed with time, and that for which he once"
"hungered he now despised. Cursed with perversities, baffled and"
"mocked, the eternal trivialities of life made the soul sink within"
"him. Not all are mild earth, to be smitten and make no moan. There are"
"sea spirits that lash and foam, fire spirits that leap and burn,--was"
he to be cursed because he was born with a soul of fire?
very name of Elleray breathes of poetry and romance. Our father and
"mother had, of course, known it in its glorious prime, when our"
"grandfather, ""Christopher North,"" wrestled with dalesmen, strolled in"
his slippers with Wordsworth to Keswick (a distance of seventeen
"miles), and kept his ten-oared barge in the long drawing-room of"
"Elleray. In these days they had ""rich company,"" and the names of"
"Southey, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and Coleridge were to them familiar"
"household words. The cottage my mother was born in still stands,"
overshadowed by a giant sycamore.'
We can easily imagine the effect which society such as this would have
"on a young man's mind. But more than that, the friendship with the"
"attractive cousin, Margaret Wilson, developed into something warmer,"
"and an engagement was finally formed, which culminated in his marriage"
in 1837. Not many of James Ferrier's letters to his cousin during the
long engagement have been preserved; the few that are were written from
"Germany in 1834, the year in which he went to Heidelberg; they were"
"addressed to Thirlstane House, near Selkirk, where Miss Wilson was"
"residing, and they give a lively account of his adventures."
"The voyage from Leith to Rotterdam, judging from the first letter"
"written from Heidelberg, and dated August 1834, would appear to have"
begun in inauspicious fashion. Ferrier writes: 'I have just been here a
"week, and would have answered your letter sooner, had it not been that"
I wished to make myself tolerably well acquainted with the surrounding
"scenery before writing to you, and really the heat has been so"
"overwhelming that I have been impelled to take matters leisurely, and"
have not even yet been able to get through so much _view-hunting_ as I
should have wished. What I have seen I will endeavour to describe to
"you. This place itself is most delightful, and the country about it is"
"magnificent. But this, as a reviewer would say, _by way of"
"anticipation_. Have patience, and in the meantime let me take events in"
"""Come,--let us go!"" she said gently. ""We twain, made one in love and"
"faith, must hasten to begin our work!--darkness gathers and deepens"
"over the Sorrowful Star,--but we, perchance, with Christ's most holy"
"Blessing, may help to lift the Shadows into Light!"""

"Away in a sheltered mountainous retreat, apart from the louder clamor"
"of the world, the Poet and his heavenly companion dwell in peace"
"together. Their love, their wondrous happiness, no mortal language can"
"define,--for spiritual love perfected as far exceeds material passion"
as the steadfast glory of the sun outshines the nickering of an earthly
"taper. Few, very few, there are who recognize, or who attain, such"
"joy,--for men chiefly occupy themselves with the SEMBLANCES of things,"
and therefore fail to grasp all high realities. Perishable
"beauty,--perishable fame,--these are mere appearances; imperishable"
"Worth is the only positive and lasting good, and in the search for"
"imperishable Worth alone, the seeker must needs encounter Angels"

But for those whose pleasure it is to doubt and deny all spiritual life
"and being, the history of Theos Alwyn can be disposed of with much"
"languid ease and cold logic, as a foolish chimera scarce worth"

it can all be traced to a powerful exertion of magnetic skill. Tranced
"into a dream bewilderment by the arts of the mystic Chaldean,"

"than that a real earth-born maiden, trained to her part, should have"
"met the dreamer there, and, with the secret aid of the hermit Elezar,"
continued his strange delusion? What more fitting as a sequel to the
"whole, than that the same maiden should have been sent to him again in"
"the great Rhine Cathedral, to complete the deception and satisfy his"
"Then followed a lean and bony man of whom no one knew anything, with a"
"frightened expression in his eyes, the left one of which had a squint."
"He was silent and timid, and had been imprisoned three times for theft"
by the High Court of Justice and the Magisterial Courts.  His family
"name was Kiselnikoff, but they called him Paltara Taras, because he was"
"a head and shoulders taller than his friend, Deacon Taras, who had been"
degraded from his office for drunkenness and immorality.  The Deacon
"was a short, thick-set person, with the chest of an athlete and a"
"round, strong head.  He danced skilfully, and was still more skilful at"
swearing.  He and Paltara Taras worked in the wood on the banks of the
"river, and in free hours he told his friend or any one who would"
"listen, ""Tales of my own composition,"" as he used to say.  On hearing"
"these stories, the heroes of which always seemed to be saints, kings,"
"priests, or generals, even the inmates of the dosshouse spat and rubbed"
"their eyes in astonishment at the imagination of the Deacon, who told"
"them shameless tales of lewd, fantastic adventures, with blinking eyes"
and a passionless expression of countenance.  The imagination of this
man was powerful and inexhaustible; he could go on relating and
"composing all day, from morning to night, without once repeating what"
he had said before.  In his expression you sometimes saw the poet gone
"astray, sometimes the romancer, and he always succeeded in making his"
tales realistic by the effective and powerful words in which he told
them.
There was also a foolish young man called Kuvalda Meteor.  One night he
came to sleep in the dosshouse and had remained ever since among these
"men, much to their astonishment.  At first they did not take much"
"notice of him.  In the daytime, like all the others, he went away to"
"find something to eat, but at nights he always loitered around this"
friendly company till at last the Captain took notice of him.

"his nose, completed Mephisto's brief spell of unalloyed liberty."
Temporarily stunned by the terrific concussion the monkey relaxed his
grip and fell.
"Just at that moment the staff-paymaster, who was scurrying below with"
"one of the pay-trays, happened to be passing in the direct line of"
Mephisto's descent. The next instant the portly officer was rolling
on the deck in a puddle of condensed milk with the monkey's paws
"clutching at his scanty crop of hair, while to complete the"
staff-paymaster's discomfiture most of the money he was carrying
rolled overboard.
Regaining his feet Staff-paymaster Staggles contrived to reach the
"companion, and with Mephisto still firmly attached to him,"
disappeared below.
But the men's attention was now directed towards more serious
matters. An ever-diverging line that rippled the placid water denoted
the approach of a deadly torpedo. Now it was heading as if about to
"hit the bows of the ""Sunderland,"" a second later and the arrow-like"
"ripples seemed to be approaching directly abeam; then, as the cruiser"
swung almost on her heel the wake of the formidable missile was
merged into the churning froth astern. It had missed by a bare yard.
From the fire-control platform telephone bells were clanging and men
shouting through the voice-tubes. From their elevated position the
"watchers could discern a long, dark shadow that marked the position"
of the submarine.
"Completely circling the ""Sunderland"" was steadied on her helm and"
steered straight for the spot. In vain the submerged craft attempted
to dive to a depth greater than that of her enemy's draught.
CHOCO INDIAN OF SAMBU VALLEY
Silver beads about his neck and leg. Face painted in glaring colors]
As a rule these Indians--men or women--are not pleasing to the eye. The
"lips are thick, the nose flat and broad, the hair coarse and always jet"
black. Yet the children are not infrequently really beautiful. Any
traveler in Panama who forsakes the beaten track up and down the Canal
Zone will be impressed by the wide extent to which beauty is found among
"the children, whatever their race or combination of races. But the charm"
soon fades. It is seldom that one sees a mature woman who is attractive
to Caucasian eyes. Among the women of the Guaymies face painting is
"practiced only on great occasions, black, red and white being the usual"
"colors. The men go painted at all times, the invariable pattern being a"
"sort of inverted V, with the apex between the eyes, and the two arms"
"extending to points, half an inch or so from the corners of the mouth."
"The lips are colored to make them seem thicker than normal, and heavy"
shadows are painted in under the eyes.
Among some tribes the wealth of a man is reckoned by the number of his
"cattle; among the Guaymies by the number of his wives. For this reason,"
"perhaps, the attainment of marriageable age is an occasion of much"
festivity for children of both sexes. The boy is exposed to tests of his
"manly and war-like qualities, and, in company with his fellows of equal"
"age, is taken by the wisemen of the tribe into the solitude of the"
forest that by performing tasks assigned to him he may prove himself a
"man. There, too, they learn from the elders, who go masked and crowned"
"with wreaths, the traditions of their tribes told in rude chants like"
the Norse sagas. Until this ceremony has been fulfilled the youth has no
name whatsoever. After it he is named and celebrates his first birthday.

"But we had parted.  She had announced her intention of leaving Paris,"
"accompanied by her mother, on the morrow, and had begged and implored"
that I would never seek her again.
"""I shall take care to evade you,"" she had said.  ""To-day we meet for the"
last time.  We must each go our own way and strive our hardest to
"forget."""
"Ah! to forget would, I knew, be impossible.  When a man has loved as"
"ardently and intensely as I loved Yolande, memories cling to him and are"
"carried to the grave.  You, reader, have loved in those half-forgotten"
"days of long ago, and even now, with age creeping on, and, perchance,"
"with grey hairs showing, sometimes give a passing thought to that fair"
one who in youth's golden days was your all in all.  The sound of a
"song, the momentary perfume from a woman's chiffons as she passes, the"
"sight of some long-forgotten scene, stirs the memory and recalls those"
hours of love and laziness when the world was so very pleasant and
"seemed to have been made for you alone.  You recollect her sweet smile,"
"her calm, womanly influence, her full red lips, and the fervency of her"
"kisses.  The tender memory to-day is sweet, even though it be tinged"
"with bitterness, for you wonder whom she has married, and how she has"
"fared; you wonder, too, if you will ever meet again, or whether she is"
already dead.  The most charming reflection permitted to man is the
memory of a half-forgotten love.
I had been a fool.  This bitter truth was forced upon me as I sat there
"ruminating.  I had cast aside that patience and discretion which I, as a"
"diplomatist, had carefully cultivated, and had actually contemplated"
marriage with a woman who had been denounced by Kaye as a secret agent.
"My own peril had been a grave one indeed, and as I reflected I began to"
wonder how it was that I should have so completely lost my self-control.
of Press Censor and officer in charge of Publicity. After the
"occupation of Brussels and the fall of Antwerp, the ""patriotic"""
Belgian Press had withdrawn itself to France and England or had
stopped publication. Its newspapers had been invited to continue
"their functions as organs of news-distribution and public opinion,"
but of course under the German Censorate and martial law. As one
"editor said to a polite German official: ""If I were to continue the"
"publication of my paper under such conditions, my staff and I would"
"all be shot in a week."""
But the large towns of Belgium could not be left without a Press.
"Public Opinion must be guided, and might very well be guided in a"
direction favourable to German policy. The German Government had
"already introduced the German hour into Belgian time, the German"
"coinage, the German police system, and German music; but it had no"
"intention, seemingly, of forcing the German speech on the old"
"dominions of the House of Burgundy. On the contrary, in their tenure"
"of Belgium or of North-east France, the Germans seemed desirous of"
"showing how well they wrote the French language, how ready they were"
under a German regime to give it a new literature. Whether or not
"they enlisted a few recreants, or made use of Alsatians or"
"Lorrainers to help them, it is never-the-less remarkable how free as"
a rule their written and printed French was from mistakes or German
idioms; though their spoken French always remained Alsatian. It
suffered from that extraordinary misplacement and exchange in the
upper and lower consonants which has distinguished the German
people--that nation of great philologists--since the death of the
"Roman Empire. German officers still said ""Barton, die fous brie,"""
"instead of ""Pardon, je vous prie"" (if they were polite), but they"
were quite able to contribute _articles de fond_ to a pretended
national Belgian press. Besides there was a sufficiency of Belgian
"""Sans-Patries"" ready to come to their assistance: Belgian nationals"

"grave in the shady corner of the garden, and only she promised herself"
to revisit it when the stern work of the night should be over and the
dawn of a calmer morning should have arisen.
"Now, as soon as Sergeant Cardono returned, he placed himself as"
completely as formerly under the orders of Rollo. He was no more José
"Maria the famous gipsy, but Sergeant Cardono of the army of H.M. Carlos"
"Quinto, and Señor Rollo was his colonel. Like a good scout he was ready"
"to advise, but to the full as ready to hold his tongue and obey."
"And Rollo, though new to his position, was not above benefiting"
"continually by his wisdom, and as a matter of fact it was the Sergeant"
"who, in conjunction with La Giralda, led the little expedition down the"
perilous goat-track by which the old gipsy had followed her flock in the
"morning. As usual Concha kept her place beside Rollo, with Mortimer and"
"Etienne a little behind, while El Sarria, taciturn but alert as usual,"
brought up the rear.
It can hardly be said that they carried with them any extraordinary
"elements of success. Indeed, in one respect they were at a manifest"
disadvantage. For in an expedition of this kind there ought to be one
"leader of dignity, character, and military genius far beyond the others."
But among this little band which stole so quietly along the
"mountain-paths of the Guadarrama, beneath the frowning snow-clad brow of"
"Peñalara, there was not one who upon occasion could not have led a"
similar forlorn hope. Each member of the party possessed a character
definite and easily to be distinguished from all the others. It was an
army of officers without any privates.
"Still, since our Firebrand, Rollo the Scot, held the nominal leadership,"
"and his quick imperious character made that chieftainship a reality,"
"must soon! It is a short start, and half of us on foot!'"
"No one answered, but in a moment we had the Waldgrave, my lady,"
"Fraulein, and one of the women mounted. Then we put up Marie, who was"
"no heavier than a feather, and the lighter of the women on the"
"remaining horse; and Steve hurrying beside the leader, and I, Ernst,"
"and Jacob bringing up the rear, we were well on the road within two"
minutes of the appearance of the horses. Those who rode had only
sacking for saddles and loops of rope for stirrups; but no one
"complained. Even Fraulein Max began to recover herself, and to dwell"
more upon the peril of capture than on aching legs and chafed knees.
"The road was good, and we made, as far as I could judge, about six"
miles in the first hour. This placed us nine miles from the camp; the
"time, a little after midnight. At this point the clouds, which had"
"aided us so far by increasing the darkness of the night, fell in a"
"great storm of rain, that, hissing on the road and among the trees, in"
a few minutes drenched us to the skin. But no one complained. Steve
muttered that it would make it the more difficult to track us; and for
"another hour we plodded on gallantly. Then our leader called a halt,"
and we stood listening.
"The rain had left the sky lighter. A waning moon, floating in a wrack"
"of watery clouds to westward, shed a faint gleam on the landscape. To"
"the right of us it disclosed a bare plain, rising gradually as it"
"receded, and offering no cover. On our left, between us and the river,"
it was different. Here a wilderness of osiers--a grey willow swamp
that in the moonlight shimmered like the best Utrecht--stretched as
"far as we could see. The road where we stood rose a few feet above it,"
so that our eyes were on a level with the highest shoots; but a
hundred yards farther on the road sank a little. We could see the
"water standing on the track in pools, and glimmering palely."
giving them their reddish tints.
LIFE OF THE DEVONIAN
PLANTS. The lands were probably clad with verdure during Silurian
"times, if not still earlier; for some rare remains of ferns and"
other lowly types of vegetation have been found in the strata of
that system. But it is in the Devonian that we discover for the
first time the remains of extensive and luxuriant forests. This
"rich flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, and it will be"
more convenient to describe its varied types in the next chapter.
RHIZOCARPS. In the shales of the Devonian are found microscopic
spores of rhizocarps in such countless numbers that their weight
must be reckoned in hundreds of millions of tons. It would seem
"that these aquatic plants culminated in this period, and in widely"
distant portions of the earth swampy flats and shallow lagoons
"were filled with vegetation of this humble type, either growing"
from the bottom or floating free upon the surface. It is to the
resinous spores of the rhizocarps that the petroleum and natural
gas from Devonian rocks are largely due. The decomposition of the
"spores has made the shales highly bituminous, and the oil and gas"
have accumulated in the reservoirs of overlying porous sandstones.
INVERTEBRATES. We must pass over the ever-changing groups of the
invertebrates with the briefest notice. Chain corals became
"extinct at the close of the Silurian, but other corals were"
extremely common in the Devonian seas. At many places corals
"formed thin reefs, as at Louisville, Kentucky, where the hardness"
of the reef rock is one of the causes of the Falls of the Ohio.
"Sponges, echinoderms, brachiopods, and mollusks were abundant. The"
will not fight for their lives. There is nothing of the sporting
proposition in pursuing them that is to be found in hunting the tiger or
"the grizzly. They are practically harmless, and in the Bayano region"
"wholly so, as there are no domestic animals upon which they can prey. It"
"is true their teeth and skins have a certain value in the market, but it"
is not for these the tourist kills them. Most of those slain for “sport”
sink instantly and cannot be recovered.
[Illustration: DOLEGA IN THE CHIRIQUI PROVINCE]
However if you visit Crocodile Creek with a typical party you will be
given a very fair imitation of a lively skirmish in actual war. From
"every part of the deck, from the roof of the cabin, and from the pilot"
house shots ring out from repeating rifles in a fierce desire to kill.
The Emersonian doctrine of compensation is often given illustration by
the killing of one of the hunters in the eagerness to get at the quarry.
In fact that is one of the commonest accidents of the tourist season in
Panama.
[Illustration: MAHOGANY TREES WITH ORCHIDS]
"Crocodile Creek is a deep, sluggish black stream, almost arched over by"
the boughs of the thick forest along the shores. Here and there the
jungle is broken by a broad shelving beach on which the ungainly beasts
"love to sun themselves, and to which the females resort to deposit their"
eggs. At the sound of a voice or a paddle in the stream the awkward
"brutes take to the water in terror, for there are few animals more"
"timid than they. When in the water the crocodile floats lazily,"
displaying only three small bumps above the surface--the nostrils and
the horny protruberances above the eyes. Once the pool in which they
float is disturbed they sink to the bottom and lurk there for hours.
Alligator hunting for business purposes is not as yet generally pursued
When I sat at the feet of Professor Campbell Fraser in the Metaphysics
"classroom at Edinburgh in 1875, Ferrier's writings were being much read"
by us students. The influence of Sir William Hamilton was fast
crumbling in the minds of young men who felt rather than saw that much
"lay beyond it. We were still engrossed with the controversy, waged in"
"books which now, alas! sell for a tenth of their former price, about"
"the Conditioned and the Unconditioned. We still worked at Reid,"
"Hamilton, and Mansel. But the attacks of Mill on the one side, and of"
"Ferrier and Dr. Stirling on the other, were slowly but surely"
withdrawing our interest. Ferrier had pointed out a path which seemed
"to lead us in the direction of Germany if we would escape from Mill,"
and Stirling was urging us in the same sense. It was not merely that
"Ferrier had written books. He had died more than ten years earlier, but"
his personality was still a living influence. Echoes of his words came
"to us through Grant and Sellar. Outside the University, men like"
Blackwood and Makgill made us feel what a power he had been. But that
was not all for at least some of us. Mrs. Ferrier had removed to
Edinburgh--and I endorse all that my sister says of her rare quality.
"She lived in a house in Torphichen Street, which was the resort of"
"those attracted, not only by the memory of her husband, but by her own"
great gifts. She was an old lady and an invalid. But though she could
"not move from her chair, paralysis had not dimmed her mental powers."
She was a true daughter of 'Christopher North.' I doubt whether I have
"seen her rival in quickness, her superior I never saw. She could talk"
"admirably to those sitting near her, and yet follow and join in the"
conversation of another group at the end of the room. She could adapt
"herself to everyone--to the shy and awkward student of eighteen, who"
"like myself was too much in awe of her to do more unhelped than answer,"
and to the distinguished men of letters who came from every quarter
attracted by her reputation for brilliance. The words of no one could
"be more incisive, the words of no one were habitually more kind than"
hers. She had known everybody. She forgot nobody. In those days the
facing these two villages. But the specimens found in Sanaroa are
"much better in colour, and I think more easily procured. The fishing"
"in this latter locality, however, is done by the Sinaketans only."
"Whether the fishing is done in their own Lagoon, near an uninhabited"
"island called Nanoula, or in Sanaroa, it is always a big, ceremonial"
"affair, in which the whole community takes part in a body. The"
"magic, or at least part of it, is done for the whole community by"
"the magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma), who also fixes the"
"dates, and conducts the ceremonial part of the proceedings. As the"
spondylus shell furnishes one of the essential episodes of a Kula
"expedition, a detailed account both of fishing and of manufacturing"
"must be here given. The native name, kaloma (in the Southern Massim"
districts the word sapi-sapi is used) describes both the shell and
"the manufactured discs. The shell is the large spondylus shell,"
"containing a crystalline layer of a red colour, varying from dirty"
"brick-red to a soft, raspberry pink, the latter being by far the most"
"prized. It lives in the cavities of coral outcrop, scattered among"
shallow mud-bottomed lagoons.
"This shell is, according to tradition, associated with the village"
"of Sinaketa. According to a Sinaketan legend, once upon a time, three"
"guya'u (chief) women, belonging to the Tabalu sub-clan of the Malasi"
"clan, wandered along, each choosing her place to settle in. The eldest"
selected the village of Omarakana; the second went to Gumilababa;
"the youngest settled in Sinaketa. She had kaloma discs in her basket,"
"and they were threaded on a long, thin stick, called viduna, such"
as is used in the final stage of manufacture. She remained first
"in a place called Kaybwa'u, but a dog howled, and she moved further"
"on. She heard again a dog howling, and she took a kaboma (wooden plate)"
and went on to the fringing reef to collect shells. She found there
"the momoka (white spondylus), and she exclaimed: ""Oh, this is the"
"The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was"
"pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered"
"subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the"
"bowels acted once, the motion containing blood."
On the second day after operation there was some improvement;
"the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to"
"100°, but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate."
"Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the"
wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was
supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.
"The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day"
it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given
"way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge"
remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of
"inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it"
was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional
"infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened"
up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh
day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300
"creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost"
"strength, although escape from the stomach considerably"
decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe hæmorrhage
"occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis."
"The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not"
"recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth"
"day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of"
the injury. No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"2. _Wounds of the small intestine._--These were comparatively common,"
but offered little that was special either in their symptoms or the
"Although these words were written nearly half a century ago, they are"
so specially applicable to-day that they seem quite “up-to-date”:
"indeed, I think they will hold equally good fifty years hence."
In spite of a strong taste on the part of children for what is ugly
"and brutal, I am sure that we ought to eliminate this element as far"
as possible from the school stories--especially among poor children.
Not because I think children should be protected from all knowledge
"of evil, but because so much of this knowledge comes into their life"
outside school that we can well afford to ignore it during school
"hours. At the same time, however, as I shall show by example when I"
"come to the positive side, it would be well to show children by story"
illustration the difference between brute ugliness without anything
"to redeem it and surface ugliness, which may be only a veil over the"
"beauty that lies underneath. It might be possible, for instance, to"
show children the difference between the real ugliness of a brutal
"story of crime and an illustration of it in the sensational papers,"
"and the apparent ugliness in the priest's face of the “Laocoon” group,"
because of the motive of courage and endurance behind the suffering.
Many stories in everyday life could be found to illustrate this.
VIII.--_Stories of infant piety and death-bed scenes._ The stories
"for children forty years ago contained much of this element, and the"
following examples will illustrate this point:
"Notes from poems written by a child between six and eight years of age,"
"by name Philip Freeman, afterwards Archdeacon of Exeter:"
"Poor Robin, thou canst fly no more,"
Thy joys and sorrows all are o'er.
"Through Life's tempestuous storms thou'st trod,"
"""Oh, if I could only save him, Lois! He was the first man I had ever"
"met whom I trusted, the first to trust me. I owe him everything, the"
little that is good in me. It had to come to life when he believed in
"it so implicitly. And he owes me ruin, outward and inward ruin."""
"Lois made no answer. With a warm, impulsive gesture she put her arms"
"about the taller woman's neck and, drawing the beautiful face down to"
"her own, kissed her. Beatrice responded, and thus a friendship was"
"sealed--not for life but for death, whose grim cordon was with every"
moment being drawn closer about them.
The sound of firing had now grown incessant. One report followed
"another at swift, irregular intervals, and each sounded like a clap of"
"thunder in the silent room. Mrs. Cary stirred uneasily in her sleep, a"
"low, scarcely audible groan escaped the parted lips, as though even in"
her dreams she was being pursued by fear's pitiless phantom. Her
"self-appointed nurse continued to fan her with the energy of despair,"
the poor livid face twitching at every fresh threatening sound. Mrs.
"Carmichael still pretended to be absorbed in her pinafore, but the"
"revolver lay on the table, ready to hand, and there was a look in the"
steady eyes which boded ill for the first enemy who should confront
her. Lois and Beatrice continued their fruitless task.
A woman's courage is the supreme victory of mind over matter. It is no
easy thing for a hero to sit still and helpless while death rattles
his bullet fingers against the walls and screams in voices of hate and
fury from a distance which every minute diminishes. For a woman
"burdened with the disability of a high-strung nervous system, it is a"
"martyrdom. Yet these women, brought up on the froth of an enervating,"
"pleasure-seeking society, held out--held out with a martyr's courage"
"and constancy--against the torture of inactivity, of an imagination"
"When I was sixteen, after I had spent eight years in Devon, and four"
"of those years at an English public school, I was in speech and almost"
in the inner fibres of my mind an Englishman. Your naval authorities
"at Plymouth and Devonport, as serenely trustful and heedless of"
"espionage as the mass of your kindly people, allowed my father--whom I"
"often accompanied--to see the dockyards, the engine shops, the"
"training schools, and the barracks. They knew that he was an Austrian"
"naval officer, and they took him to their hearts as a brother, of the"
common universal brotherhood of the sea. I think that your Navy holds
those of a foreign naval service as more nearly of kin to themselves
than civilians of their own blood. The bond of a common profession is
more close than the bond of a common nationality. I do not doubt that
my father sent much information to our Embassy in London--it was what
he was employed to do--but I am sure that he did not basely betray the
wonderful confidence of his hosts. Our countries were at peace. My
father is no Prussian; he is a chivalrous gentleman. I am sure that he
did not send more than his English naval friends were content at the
time that he should send. For in those years your newspapers and your
books upon the Royal Navy of England concealed little from the world.
I have visited Dartmouth; I have dined in the Naval College there with
"bright sailor boys of my own age. It was then my one dream, had I"
"remained in England, to have become an Englishman, and to have myself"
"served in your Navy. It was a vain dream, but I knew no better. Fate"
and my birth made me afterwards your enemy. I would have fought you
"gladly face to face on land or sea, but never, never, would I have"
stabbed the meanest of Englishmen in the back.
When I was sixteen years old I left England with my parents and
returned to Triest. I was a good mathematician with a keen taste for
"mechanics. I spent two years in the naval engineering shops at Pola,"
and I was gazetted as a sub-lieutenant in the engineering branch of
THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS. It is to the igneous rocks that
we may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas
"contain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no"
doubt this was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed
the original earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the
"metals have been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even"
the sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and
"other metals, but in this widely diffused condition they are"
wholly useless to man. The concentration which has made them
available is due to the interaction of many agencies. Earth
"movements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust, the intrusion"
"of heated masses, the circulation of underground waters, have all"
cooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins.
"While fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the"
latter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled
"by similar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as"
"limestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes"
"filled with metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and"
zinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous
"aquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case"
of some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New
Mexico.

HISTORICAL GEOLOGY
"""Go down a hundred yards or so,"" she said, ""and there you will find a"
gate. Open it with that key and bring over your animals to the little
"pavilion among the trees by the fountain."""
Upon hearing this the Princess instantly changed her tune. She had got
"her own way, and now it was ""Beautiful Doña Susana! Precious and"
"loveliest companion, when I am Queen you shall have the greatest and"
"handsomest grandee in the kingdom to be your husband, and walk in"
"diamonds and rubies at our court balls! Yes, you shall. I promise it by"
my royal oath. And now I will run to the house kitchen for basins to
"catch the goats' milk in, and my little churn to churn the butter"
"in--and--and----"""
But before she had catalogued half the things that she meant to find and
"bring she departed at the top of her speed, making the air ring with her"
shouts of delight.
"Slowly, and with the meekest dignity, La Giralda did as she was bidden."
"She found the little gate, which, indeed, proved so narrow that she"
could not get her donkey to pass through with his great side-burdens of
"fagots. But as these were not at all heavy, La Giralda herself detached"
"them, and, laying them carefully within the railings, she unhaltered the"
"patient beast and, tying him only with a cord about his neck, left him a"
generous freedom of browsing upon the royal grass-plots and undergrowth.
"The goats, however, perhaps alarmed by the trim daintiness of the place"
"and the unwonted spectacle of unlimited leaves and forage, kept close"
"together. One or two of them, indeed, smelt doubtfully at luxuriant"
"tufts, but as they had only previously seen grass in single blades, and"
"amid Saharas of gravel and sand, the experiment of eating an entire"
mouthful at a time appeared too hazardous and desperate. They were of a
"cautious turn of mind, in addition to which their udders had become so"
"Fairy Tale element presented to him. In “Father and Son,” Mr. Edmund"
Gosse says:
"“Meanwhile, capable as I was of reading, I found my greatest pleasure"
"in the pages of books. The range of these was limited, for story-books"
"of every description were sternly excluded. No fiction of any kind,"
"religious or secular, was admitted into the house. In this it was to"
"my Mother, not to my Father, that the prohibition was due. She had a"
"remarkable, I confess, to me somewhat unaccountable impression that to"
"‘tell a story,’ that is, to compose fictitious narrative of any kind,"
was a sin.... Nor would she read the chivalrous tales in the verse of
"Sir Walter Scott, obstinately alleging that they were not true. She"
"would read nothing but lyrical and subjective poetry.... As a child,"
"however, she had possessed a passion for making up stories, and so"
"considerable a skill in it, that she was constantly being begged to"
"indulge others with its exercise.... ‘When I was a very little child,’"
"she says, ‘I used to amuse myself and my brothers with inventing"
"stories such as I had read. Having, as I suppose, naturally a restless"
"mind and busy imagination, this soon became the chief pleasure of"
"my life. Unfortunately, my brothers were always fond of encouraging"
"this propensity, and I found in Taylor, my maid, a still greater"
"tempter. I had not known there was any harm in it, until Miss Shore (a"
"Calvinistic governess), finding it out, lectured me severely and told"
me it was wicked. From that time forth I considered that to invent
a story of any kind was a sin.... But the longing to invent stories
grew with violence. The simplicity of Truth was not enough for me. I
"must needs embroider imagination upon it, and the folly and wickedness"
which disgraced my heart are more than I am able to express....’ This
"(the Author, her son, adds) is surely a very painful instance of the"
repression of an instinct.”
"In contrast to the stifling of the imagination, it is good to recall"
[her trained nurse] says I am tucked up for the night and can have no
"receptions, levees, or interviews. I tell her she will lose her title"
"and become the Kommon Kat; but she does n't seem to mind. Oh, it's just"
lovely to feel that you 're in the house again. S._
"Risca looked round the dainty room, his whenever he chose to occupy it,"
"and knew how much, especially of late, it held of Stellamaris. It had"
"been redecorated a short while before, and the colours and the patterns"
and all had been her choice and specification.
"The castle architect, a young and fervent soul called Wratislaw, a"
"member of the Art Workers' Guild, and a friend of Herold's, who had"
"settled in Southcliff-on-Sea, and was building, for the sake of a"
"precarious livelihood, hideous bungalows which made his own heart sick,"
"but his clients' hearts rejoice, had been called in to advise. With"
"Stellamaris, sovereign lady of the house, aged fifteen, he had spent"
hours of stupefied and aesthetic delight. He had brought her armfuls of
"designs, cartloads of illustrated books; and the result of it all was"
"that, with certain other redecorations in the house with which for"
"the moment we have no concern, Risca's room was transformed from"
late-Victorian solidity into early-Georgian elegance. The Adam Brothers
"reigned in ceiling and cornice, and the authentic spirit of Sheraton,"
"thanks to the infatuated enterprise of Wratislaw, pervaded the"
"furniture. Yet, despite Wratislaw, although through him she had spoken,"
the presence of Stellamaris pervaded the room. On the writing-table lay
"a leather-covered blotter, with his initials, J. R., stamped in gold. In"
"desperate answer to a childish question long ago, he had described the"
bedspread on his Parian marble bed in the palace as a thing of rosebuds
and crinkly ribbons tied up in true-lovers' knots. On his bed in
Stella's house lay a spread exquisitely Louis XV in design.
"Risca looked about the room. Yes, everything was Stella. And behold"
"itself it lies under a spell. It is slow and dark, and has a surface"
"like a mirror, and it flows uphill. There is no doubt about it; anyone"
"can see it. When they came here, my friend tells me, they made a halt,"
and the Burmese hunters with him unpacked his breakfast. He did not want
"to eat then, he said, but they explained that it was not for him, but"
"for the Nats. All his food was unpacked, cold chicken and tinned meats,"
"and jam and eggs and bread, and it was spread neatly on a cloth under a"
tree. Then the hunters called upon the Nats to come and take anything
"they desired, while my friend wondered what he should do if the Nats"
"took all his food and left him with nothing. But no Nats came, although"
"the Burmans called again and again. So they packed up the food, saying"
"that now the Nats would be pleased at the courtesy shown to them, and"
"that my friend would have good sport. Presently they went on, leaving,"
"however, an egg or two and a little salt, in case the Nats might be"
"hungry later, and true enough it was that they did have good luck. At"
"other times, my friend says, when he did not observe this ceremony, he"
"saw nothing to shoot at all, but on this day he did well."
The former history of all Nats is not known. Whether they have had a
"previous existence in another form, and if so, what, is a secret that"
"they usually keep carefully to themselves, but the history of the Popa"
Nats is well known. Everyone who lives near the great hill can tell you
"that, for it all happened not so long ago. How long exactly no one can"
"say, but not so long that the details of the story have become at all"
clouded by the mists of time.
"They were brother and sister, these Popa Nats, and they had lived away"
"up North. The brother was a blacksmith, and he was a very strong man. He"
was the strongest man in all the country; the blow of his hammer on the
"anvil made the earth tremble, and his forge was as the mouth of hell. No"
one was so much feared and so much sought after as he. And as he was
"strong, so his sister was beautiful beyond all the maidens of the time."
in _Shadowings_) also gives a vivid account of his own childish
night-terrors.]
"[Footnote 89: It has not, I believe, been pointed out that such dreams"
might be invoked in support of the James-Lange or physiological theory of
"emotion, according to which the element of bodily change in emotion is the"
cause and not the result of the emotion.]
[Footnote 90: This physiological symbolism was clearly apprehended long
ago by Hobbes: 'As anger causeth heat in some parts of the body when we
are awake; so when we sleep the overheating of the same parts causeth
"anger, and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of an enemy. In the"
"same manner as natural kindness, when we are awake, causeth desire and"
"desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so also, too much"
"heat in those parts, while we sleep, raiseth in the brain an imagination"
"of some kindness shown. In sum, our dreams are the reverse of our waking"
"imaginations; the motion, when we are awake, beginning at one end, and"
"when we dream at another' (_Leviathan_, Part 1. ch. 2).]"
"[Footnote 91: 'The pains of disappointment, of anxiety, of unsuccess, of"
"all displeasing emotions,' remarks Mercier (art. 'Consciousness,' Tuke's"
"_Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_), 'are attended by a definite"
feeling of misery which is referred in every case to the epigastrium.' He
"adds that the pleasures of success and good repute, aesthetic enjoyment,"
"etc., are also attended by a definite feeling in the same region. This"
fact indicates the extreme vagueness of organic sensation. There is in
"fact much uncertainty and great difference of opinion as to the nature,"
"and even the existence, of organic sensation; see _e.g._ a careful summary"
"of the chief views by Dr. Elsie Murray, 'Organic Sensation,' _American"
"Journal of Psychology_, July 1909.]"

Mother.
So I sent you here to wed a king
And find you engaged to a bastard.
"My darling, your engagement"
To francis was a careful negotiation set in place
When you were six.
And now you tell me
That you threw it all away because of a prophecy.
"One I believe, mother."
I did this and bash went along with it to save francis's life.
From a fate a magician predicted.
"Mother, it's all very..."
Complicated.
And we haven't been together in so long.
I came to the convent for your 11th birthday.
"Half the ship's crew died along the way,"
But I was there.
Gift in hand.
I only meant to say that...
I've missed you.
"And I wanted to talk to you about this, about francis,"
"About bash, a-about everything."
Please don't make light of nostradamus's warning
Or my choice.
I make light of nothing concerning you
Or our country's future.
Perhaps if you met bash.
He's-he's kind and-and selfless and brave.
Do you love him?
I'm beginning to.
It all happened so fast.
Yes.
For three points.
"No he's not, is it?"
Yes!
Who is he?
Benedict.
"He was the last one, Benedict."
Your answers?
Ratzinger and Benedict.
Show me your first letters.
Yeah...
And that one?
I guess so?
Let's see if you're right?
"Correct, for two points."
"Now there's something rather interesting about Pope Benedict and the current Pope, do you know what it is?"
He's the last one to resign for a long time.
For about 600 years.
"And so you have a situation where we have a Pope who's resigned, and you've also got a Pope, who's Pope Francis."
So Pope Benedict is now known as Pope Emeritus.
"So for the first time in about 600 years, we have two popes who are alive at the same time."
"Right, where are we at the end that round?"
"Lutrophiles, eight points, very well done."
"Araucarians, you're on four."
"It's round two, and you'll each face two hives containing three answers relating to a specific topic."
You've 45 seconds to complete each hive and score a maximum five points.
"So Team Lutrophiles, you're in the lead, you get to choose first from..."
"So, choose your topic first of all."
Physics or Geography?
Geography could be a lot of things.
Shall we go with physics?
OK.
Dear little Buttercup
Though I could never tell why
A little louder.
But still I'm called Buttercup
Pool little Buttercup
"Sweet little Buttercup, I"
Robin?
What's happening?
"Batman, I want you to come with me later today and rob a bank."
"Robin, don't even joke about such a thing."
Have you lost all your sense of judgment?
"Holy reverse polarity, I did it!"
I got you out of Black Widow's clutches!
"Of course, I knew what I was doing but with my cerebrum short circuited I couldn't stop myself."
"You sit down here, Robin."
I'll retie your hands and pretend that my brain is still short circuited.
"Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City, commissioner."
Yes.
But I was faced with the decision and I had to make it.
How will we be breaking the news to the people?
We'll tell them the truth.
Batman was shot and killed when he and Robin...
Robin?
No doubt he's gone into hiding.
Most likely in the Batcave.
Maybe I can talk to him.
Get him to surrender.
So no more of the Dynamic Duo's blood will be spilled on the streets of our fair city.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Batman is not here.
I know that.
- We've lost the Caped Crusader.
"It wasn't a casino, it was a crappy little game in the back of a-a pizza place."
"Hey, hey!"
NCIS is back.
How many slices can I get you gentlemen?
Where's the game?
"Whoa, you can't go back there."
NCIS.
Do not move.
"Okay, look, I admit to hosting the game, but it was all in good fun."
"I mean, all this nonsense about drugging anybody-- that's just crazy."
Found this in the cabinet next to the oregano.
Try again.
"All right, what can I say?"
I'm not proud.
But times are tough.
"I mean, who doesn't need a little extra cash?"
"Cash off the backs of young sailors, serving their country, on liberty, in a crooked game?"
"Hey, the game itself is not crooked."
We deal straight.
They're ain't no sleight of hand here.
Just a little shot of this crap to give you the edge.
What?
They don't comp drinks in Vegas?
"You're not Vegas, Marty!"
This is a drug.
It's not a drink.
This kid died playing your game.
"Oh, no."
No way!
"One of these pills-- it'll make you woozy, but it never killed anybody."
Never.
Tell me about that night.
It's a no-brainer.
Run!
"Oh, God, no!"
"Okay, man, let's see him."
"Ma'am, had you ever seen him before last night?"
No.
What happened after you heard the sound?
I got the gun from the lock box in my closet.
Do you need the lock box too?
We'll let you know.
I moved toward the sound thinking that it couldn't be Chelsea because Chelsea comes up the stairs in a certain way.
I wasn't even supposed to be home.
"I saw the boy, he turned towards me."
Things like this aren't supposed to happen to people like Chelsea and me.
So how is Chelsea?
"""My mom is so brave, the way she defended our home."
"""She is my role model in all things."
"""I am so proud to be her daughter."
"""I only hope that in the same situation, I would have as much courage."" Thank you."
Chelsea!
Chelsea!
One more!
"Turn around, Chelsea."
Chelsea!
"Mom shoots a burglar, daughter holds a press conference."
I love LA.
"Evening, Counselor."
"Hey, you two got a minute?"
"I got a 314 awaiting a plea, but Morales wants a copy of your report on the Sennett house shooting."
"With all the press, he doesn't want to let it hang."
It's not as simple as it looks.
"The rest of the crew's still out there, and Chelsea Sennett's in too many right places for it to be a coincidence."
I have 10 times more experience than any Ivy League kid.
It's not just about experience.
I would need to depend on you every day.
What do you want me to do?
I'll start at the-
- I'll start at the bottom.
Just give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
"- Yeah, I think I got a shot."
- Really?
You know how it is.
They gotta go talk amongst themselves and...
These-
"- Look, these things, they can be really political."
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.
He has phone calls to the congressional leadership.
First lady is back tonight?
Empress is wheels down at 1845.
"They're supposed to have dinner at the residence, but you know how they are."
"So we should have an advance on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual."
- What if she wants sushi?
"- No, no, she's off sushi."
Remember she had that thing on the Japan trip?
"- Carol, how are you still awake?"
"- Caffeine and patriotism, sir."
- Threat matrix?
- Well threats against POTUS have quadrupled since the G8 speech.
PID is keeping an eye on a guy in Buffalo they're worried about.
- Visitors today?
"Then I took a second to get to know the guy, and he turned out to be a pretty good friend."
"- Well, um, I'm not here to make friends."
"- Yeah, well, mission accomplished."
"- Look, clearly, this isn't working."
- Clearly.
"So, let's just..."
"Look, you do the first half of the assignment, then I'll go over it before I put it together with mine."
- And I'll go over yours.
- Fine.
Then I guess we'll have to get together this weekend and go over it together.
Sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend.
See ya.
- The Bait Shop.
Where is that exactly?
- I don't know.
"- So where'd you get these from, then?"
"- Uh, you know, uh, Cohen."
- He gave them to you?
- To us.
Hmm.
Why'd he do that?
"Um, well, he said he wants to be friends, that he's trying to change."
"Um, to be less Coheny and more like, well, a person."
- Don't you think he might be trying that just to win you back?
- No.
- I mean no.
"- Okay, let's just say, hypothetically,"
Seth really is changing.
Would that mean you'd want to get back together with him?
"- Well, hypothetically?"
- You know what?
Don't answer.
I think we all need to take a moment.
Mr. Campbell-- looks like I found one dumb enough not to.
"- Mr. Campbell, I think if you sit down again..."
- No!
I think that we could all...
"What the hell are you doing, man?"
- He doesn't have a case.
"- Maybe, maybe not but he's the client."
"Yeah, well, he was pushing my buttons."
I don't care if he punched you in the face.
"Look, we're both trying to make partner here, Adam."
All right?
"I haven't said anything to you before this because... it was none of my business, but now you're making it my business because it's affecting me."
"- So what's your point, Jimmy?"
- We both know this is about you and Brian.
"Now you don't want to talk to me, that's fine."
"But, uh, talk to somebody before you ruin both of our careers."
Just a minute.
I'm coming!
- It's me.
Thank god you're here.
I have no idea what to wear and...
Hi.
Did you read my mind?
No.
These are just the maternity clothes that you lent me.
"Well, I don't need them back."
I'm not gonna have a baby anytime.
Ever.
I-I don't need them.
I--I'm going for a more...
- Classic look.
I'm out of gas and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
I got to make water!
"Yo, doc!"
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
"Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area."
I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
- Now the ring finger.
"- Robert, I simply compiled a report."
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.
It's not my dominant hand.
"In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity."
I'll be in my office in two weeks...
- ... and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
- That's enough for today.
"- No, keep going."
"Sorry, have another patient."
"Don't get comfortable, Kerry."
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.
Lizzy.

Long distance?
Chicago?
"See here, Mr. Norstaad."
I've been your leading representative in the Midwest for the past ten years now.
You can't do this to me.
Do?
I do something?
"You, Somers, who's ever running things--"
He's got a salesman in Chicago trying to saturate the market.
"Why, he's taking orders at prices so low the furniture bearing your trademark could be sold retail for less than I paid you."
"Oh, no."
"No, that's impossible."
Is it?
"Well, I've seen signed duplicates of the orders with my own eyes."
I call you back.
Parker.
I told you I wanted you to bring me some pieces to show to salesmen.
These pieces ready to show to anybody.
- I've told you I want production--
- But he's not in today.
If you'll call for an appointment--
"So now I need an appointment, huh?"
What's the matter?
You are hiding from somebody?
"No, no, of course not."
"Come on into my office where we can talk, Norstaad."
Aha.
"Ramsey from Chicago, he calls me."
He tells me that you sell furniture under my trademark cheaper than I can make it.
I want to know how can you do that?
"That's my business, I'm afraid."
"No, mine."
"Leaving, not going up."
"What was that all about - five minutes, where did that come from?"
You...
It's the human male from the Institute.
What's he doing here?
"Suggest we melt his brain using projectile acid fish, and then interrogate him."
Other way round.
Am I going to have the nightmare tonight?
Definitely not.
How do you know?
Because someone's coming to help.
Who?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Is it one of your stories?
Your definitely true ones?
Huh!
All my stories are true.
Like how you were born behind the clock face of Big Ben?
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
And you invented fish.
Because I dislike swimming alone.
So what's this one?
There's a man called the Doctor.
"He lives on a cloud in the sky, and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams."
I've been having bad dreams.
He's been on holiday.
But I am confident he has now returned to work.
"And as a matter of fact, he's right here..."
"Aren't you, Doctor?"
Bloomin' hell!
The children have been very naughty!
"Get back, now, quickly."
- No.
But many people out there do.
"Wendy, how did you pick the numbers you played?"
- How did I what?
- How did you choose the numbers?
"Oh, I get what you're saying."
"Okay, I get it, I get it!"
"Um, wow."
"Uh, let's see, uh, seventy... seventy is because... a cheeseburger deluxe with bacon... is 70 cents extra."
"And, um, 16..."
"When I was 16, I went to a party."
"And, uh, nine..."
"Well, nine, we all know, is just lucky."
"Oh, man."
"And, um, seven is..."
"I have seven Barbies, not including the ones that got their face chewed off... by the next door neighbor's dog, who's just such a great dog."
[Russ Narrating] There it is-- a story to tell your grandchildren.
"Well, maybe not."
"Dick Simmons was fired from WTPA... after calling the network head ""the luckiest asshole on Earth."""
He now teaches communications at Pocono Community College.
Ethics.
Crystal married and divorced a sickly 80-year-old millionaire... and sued him for half his money.
"She testified he was a Svengali, a word she mispronounced throughout the trial."
He was like...
"like this ""Svenjelly""."
[Russ] She lost the case.
You're making my dreams come true
She works at Gig's five nights a week.
"No cover charge, free buffalo wings with coupon."
Thirty-nine!
Gig bought an obscure stock called Microsoft in 1990.
He now divides his time between Harrisburg and his estate in Monaco.
What else?
Checking account shows one charge last night at Sposare's Pizza in Baltimore just before 3:00 a.m.
"Pizza and beer-- that's a hell of a last meal, right, bo...?"
Go.
"Boss, we may have a situation."
That was the ship's commander.
All 215 sailors reported back for duty this morning.
"All except Petty Officer Adams and this man... 21-year-old Petty Officer Brian Smith, from Virginia."
Maybe a second victim?
Or maybe involved.
No way to know that yet.
Figure it out.
Go on.
"Hey, I'm just grateful for this time of year."
"Liberty Week, the sales almost double my regular day."
But you do not remember ever seeing
Petty Officer Adams this morning?
No.
"It's a real shame about that kid, but no."
I-I never saw him.
"I mean, look around."
"Not exactly easy telling 'em apart, you know."
"I think it was Mae West who said,"
"""You've seen one sailor's anchor, you've seen 'em all."""
"No, I just kind of meant that it gets hectic in here."
"You know, all of 'em in here at once."
A bunch of 'em all yelling for service.
"Anyone get out of control, start a fight?"
"Oh, no, nothing like that."
"No, no, these are all good kids."
I-I never had any trouble.
Are you guys here about Caleb?
It makes me want to break everything right now
If I can't hear the words I yearn for again
I'd carelessly offer my life
Desires that cuddle
With a fading light
It's lonely
Will the morning sun come before me?
Answer me
Is there a love that binds us?
Stand and face the despair we invited
The wills of the people
Born and destroyed
Choose the future and open the lock
"All groups, commence preparations."
Securing water takes priority.
"Everyone who's not busy, pitch some tents."
Going to fetch some water!
Don't drag your feet.
"Hey, lend a hand with the tent-pitching!"
What a pain.
No thanks.
"- Hey, Kiefer!"
Say something to Ryner!
"- Oh, my poor stomach..."
"Ah... sorry, I didn't hear you."
"Kiefer, the layabout says he won't help with tent-pitching."
"Ryner only listens to you, Kiefer."
"You did something to Kiefer, huh?"
- Not a thing.
"- She's definitely not herself, though."
You're all so dense.
"I mean, we're in a war!"
You keep talking to me for no reason.
Did you lose it?
You can't retrieve it?
Moon Kwon.
Yes?
"When I completed the manuscript for the autobiography yesterday, didn't I send it?"
"You must have, you said you were."
"You sent that, made some fried eggs and we had one each."
They didn't get it?
It disappeared?
"Fine, all right."
Emails are now not only arriving late but disappearing?
No way.
I didn't send it.
There's no record.
"Noona, what's wrong with you?"
Why do you keep forgetting things?
"Stop taking the painkillers, I think that's the problem."
"I sent it, please check."
Change my phone number.
"You said you could do it through the homepage, right?"
"Yes, but why?"
When I tell you to do something just do it.
Do you have to know everything?
You do that too.
"All right, all right."
"I'll shut my mouth and complete my task,"
I have no complaints!
"Change your clothes and wash up, I'm hungry."
Let's eat some curry.
What did you say?
"I made some curry and rice, didn't you hear?"
So...radio stations in here?
"Little kday, little old-school rap for me."
"Definitely the first person to check out the radio on the backstretch, which is the fastest part of the course."
"Oh, my God."
There it is.
[ Tires screech ]
A happy tire is a squealing tire.
"That's right, making stig proud."
Good speed on the backstretch.
"All right, coming through the last turn here."
"Nice and smooth, and across the line."
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Lake, come on up."
So lovely.
How are you?
"Have a seat, please."
"It's nice, right?"
How'd it go in the suzuki?
"It's fun to say the word ""suzuki,"" you know?"
[ Laughter ]
"- So, that's, like, good news."
- Right.
"But otherwise, in terms of fastness and times, all that..."
I hope I didn't let you down.
"Oh, come on."
"No, you didn't."
"Let's just get comfortable with being in the lower Echelon, and then I'll be more comfortable with it."
Do I look comfortable?
"Everybody's gonna be comfortable because you are a beautiful woman that loves cars, so they already love you."
I love cars.
I love cars.
How'd you get into cars?
I am Yang Siu of the Ming Cult and am begging your pardon on behalf of the kids
Yang Siu
Let's go quickly
You are Yang Siu of the Ming Cult?
That's right
"Sister Bu Huei, he's your father"
My father?
How did you know I am here?
"As in every past year, I went to your home and see what had happened in there"
So I knew something must have gone wrong then I came here
where's your mother?
She's dead
Okay...
I have at last delivered you to your father
I can go to wu Dong myself
"Little brother, you..."
Never mind who I am you'll never see me again
Brother wu Ji what is it?
I hope to see you again
"Okay, if my wounds are healed"
I'll look for you
Farewell
It's so cold
Damn the Freezing Poison
"Grand teacher, I fear I won't be able to return to wu Dong to see you"
Don't run
"Bitch, see where you can run to?"
Don't kill me...
I ain't responsible for Gold  Silver Serpent's poison who else could it be?
"Madam, let her go"
She has been hit by the Deadly Dart of our Kwun Lun School
She is doomed
"So, anyway..."
It's really great to see you again.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you too."
Then...
You're happy?
Yeah.
"Like you said, It's all good."
"It's just... kinda hard knowing that I'm not even 30, and the greatest thing that will ever happen to me already happened."
"You take care of yourself, okay?"
Am I... the best thing that's ever happened to you?
"Baby, come on."
'Course you are.
- Really?
- Sure.
You're not counting playing in the Super Bowl.
"I mean, come on."
It's the Super Bowl.
But you're definitely number two.
"Oh, wait."
There's that million-dollar check I got for putting my name on that stupid barbeque grill.
That didn't suck.
"So it goes Super Bowl, big check, then you."
Dinner at the White House...
"When I was planning this party, I kept looking at these kids."
"And they're all smiling, and happy, and hopeful, and..."
"I kept thinking, ""How many of these kids are happy today?"""
I would say... all the ones who didn't come to this party.
I'm serious.
There were 28 of us in the class.
"How many of us are already, like, stuck in lousy jobs, or bad marriages?"
How many of us have already made that one big dumb choice we'll never really recover from?
- to save your family.
- And I would not wish the pain of that failure upon anyone.
I would rather live with that pain than this.
"And that's just the thing, Sara."
"Look, if you were able to try to save Laurel, then you wouldn't be alive at all."
Then fine.
I don't care.
"When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline."
"Now had it remained the same, then Damien Darhk would have..."
He would have killed not only you and...
"and your sister, but your father as well."
"But, Rip, if... if we go back, and we take the team..."
The outcome would be exactly the same.
You don't know that.
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.
I...
There's got to be a way.
"Rip, I have to be able to do something."
I'm so sorry.
"Look, I can't."
Can't do this without my sister.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
"You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, Sara."
Laurel...
"Laurel may be beyond your saving, but Kendra and Carter, they might not be."
"Captain, we are prepared to make the time jump to 1944."
"We're on our way, Gideon."
We've arrived in Saint-Lô.
"No sign of Kendra yet, but I have located"
"Vandal Savage, and he does not seem to be alone."
"Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Goodbye.
Marion.
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I've had so much fun.
"I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful things there are for two people to do."
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please."
"- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!"
"- Connie, listen..."
"All right, let's talk about this."
I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
- Just like that?
- That's right.
"- We're not kids, we're adults."
- And we'll behave like adults.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality."
"That's not lust, you should know the difference."
What do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...?
Human.
All men are alike.
The approach is different but the result is always the same.
"Sooner or later, we get to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby..."
Or in my home?
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.
- What do you call it?
I'll tell you a truth about yourself.
"Dad, What's this mess?"
"You didn't met her, You gave me her picture in envelope,"
Then how could I met her?
"And this one was for another Laxmi,"
Who is this another Laxminarayan?
"Sir, which kind of bomb you make?"
"It doesn't works,"
"Mr. Laxmi, I have diploma,"
Where you get this diploma's from?
"Papa, let's go to the straight, and press it from front, some things doesn't works to press from back side,"
I came here to take underwear and I got car.
"Think about that Laxminarayan, who came here to take car... and take underwear from here."
"It's the same car, what I was talking about,"
"This car was in your luck, not in that Laxminarayan, don't know where he would be?"
"Excuse me Madam, Excuse me Madam,"
"Excuse me Madam, Excuse me Sir, Can I come in?"
"Can I come in, Can I say something?"
Sure!
"Sir, Madam, I am that another Laxminarayan,"
"He was in my next room, Right Sir!"
"Madam, I came here to but this car for Mr. Pipot,"
Oh!
Yeah!
"He called me, Right Madam."
"I am his special man, Pipot's man?"
Right Sir!
"Tell me one thing,"
Your Pipot didn't have any women?
"No Sir, He have two women,"
Two Women?
Right Sir!
"And he keep a man, Which kind of man he is?"
- Buying myself a piñata.
- A personal piñata?
"End of a hard week, you just string up a piñata, whack the crap out of it, and it rains candy on you."
- It's the best.
- But I don't understand.
"Cookie, you were also buying a piñata?"
"Yeah, I mean, what are the odds, right?"
When two people who both love piñatas find each other?
Very unexpected.
"'Cause, you know, normally I date, you know, really tough guys, right?"
- It's what I would assume.
"- Yeah, bounty hunters,"
"MMA fighters, and large animal vets, but, man, none of those guys made me laugh like this man."
- You're a party in a bottle.
- There's no denying that.
"And the physical part is just... it's, um... seamless."
"When you say ""seamless,"" what do you mean by..."
"- Well, we need more apps."
- You don't know where his body
- ends and yours begins?
- You guys need more apps?
- Is that what it is?
"- I do, yeah."
- Who wants more apps?
"- I'm good, thanks."
I'll get you some then.
"Oh, my God, can you believe it?"
"We thought Nancy was gonna be some terrible woman who was like, ""my Crock-Pot,"" and instead, it's Cookie!"
- [laughs]
- You must be so psyched.
"- I am so psyched, really."
"- Oh, God, imagine what."

GERALD EARLY:
JACKIE ROBINSON WAS AN INTEGRATIONIST.
"SYMBOLICALLY, EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR WAS"
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO CAREERS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WHITE PEOPLE HAD.
BUT THERE WERE LOTS OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO WERE UPSET WITH THAT
BECAUSE THEY FELT IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT INTEGRATION
SHOULD COME AT THE EXPENSE OF BLACK PEOPLE'S OWN INSTITUTIONS.
"ONCE INTEGRATION HAPPENED,"
THE NEGRO LEAGUES WERE NO LONGER VIABLE.

I think we just solved a murder.
The sun is in our eyes and in our hearts even when it's night and when it's dark.
"The moon still glows, the stars still shine,"
Now and forever until the end of time.
What do you think?
I think you need to dig deeper.
What does that mean?
I can't tell you that.
"It's just, like, part of the journey."
"You look pretty, Mama."
"Thank you, baby."
"I'm gonna go get my notebook, okay?"
I wrote more poems.
That's great.
"So, keep an eye on Jess and Naomi, shut down any fist fights, and..."
"Yeah, I shouldn't be too late."
So are you still in business?
"As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings."
I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation.
What do you mean?
I want in.
We could be partners.
I already have a partner.
"Well, then I'll be your receptionist."
It doesn't work like that.
"Mary, I need a career change, and we'd make a great team."
"Let's talk about this later, shall we?"
You need me.
I love you.
"Hey, where are you going, anyway?"
A funeral.
It's the first symptom of flett-giordano.
Would you just excuse me for just one moment?
Where's Elka?
She said this thing had no symptoms... and I'm out there... limping around like Dr. house.
Elka said she looked it up on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia?
Wikipedia says that I'm 37.
And I should know.
"I'm the one who ""corrected"" it."
"Okay, calm down."
I'll look it up online.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry.
Uh...
"So in, in terms of publicity,"
"I was thinking-- miss Chase, when exactly were you diagnosed?"
"Uh, last week."
Why?
The most acute symptoms... occur within the first week of onset.
"By now, you should be having trouble with... facial drooping, involuntary body spasms, word slurring, hysteria."
"Boy, this thing is awful."
"Yes, it is."
That's why we applaud your courage in going public... with such a disfiguring disease.
Disfiguring?
Who said anything about disfiguring?
Well.
There's that hysteria.
"Miss Chase,"
"I understand why you're wearing this scarf, but may we just take a look?"
"Oh, um, listen."
Could you just excuse me for just one more second?
Wow.
"- No, no."
- She gets defensive.
"- No, I don't get defensive."
- I'm not defensive.
I'm not!
- She gets defensive.
Ladies.
"I am gonna meet with you before every date, and we're gonna check your clothes, your makeup."
To make sure you're projecting the right image.
Based on the bachelors.
We'll go over mutual areas of interest.
"Now, I have been going over your questionnaire and it seems like your priorities are..."
Huh...
"Well, looks."
"Oh, no."
"That doesn't sound like you, Kitty."
"No, it's me."
It's me.
It's me.
"Well, sweetheart, looks fade."
"You want someone intelligent, who'll make you laugh."
"And cultured, so you can travel with him."
- Go to the theater.
- Since when do I go to the theater?
"You know, Miss Walker, I just signed a client who sounds exactly like the man you're describing."
"He's charming, funny."
I think he's about your age.
"Never married, so he's not bitter."
And he's an accomplished ballroom dancer.
I think he would love to meet you.
Know what?
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
I'm gonna marry her one day.
cool.
"Man, this place is huge."
"-Imposing, is what it is."
-It's big.
Just looking at the size of the place just gives that extra edge to the nerve in a way because there's like double the people to impress.
How's it going?
"Hey, man."
"Wow, this is big."
Let's have a look.
This is mad.
Bad idea.
Nice day.
"Oh, my God."
This place is huge.
This is mad.
Sick.
his is absolutely mad.
can't wait to get out here and play.
I just wanna get on with it.
hello.
t was the most exciting thing in the world.
"I really wish my parents were here, actually, to see it because they don't get to see a Iot of us and to see us doing something like this and see what it's all about...."
"But it's good we're getting it in the film, so they'II get to see anyway."
So everyone's a winner.
You know if we'd got ask ed  two years ago what we thought would happen we never would've said this.
hen think about how lucky we actually are to be in this position....
"It's, Iike, probably one in a million chance to be where I am."
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"f one of us just didn't happen to go to our audition then you know, it could be so different."
e are definitely the five Iuckiest dudes.
"Well, he's come back to life."
What are his paintings worth?
Depends on size.
"And artistic merit, presumably."
"Not really, just size."
(Mobile phone rings)
He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.
What's he done with all of it?
"Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you."
"No, I won't."
"This is crap, isn't it, Flick?"
Complete.
"No, this time you've gone too far."
"I've spoken to the lawyers, you're never going to see your son again."
I don't know how you can look at yourself every morning without throwing up.
Am I going to get a look-in on this conversation?
"No, because I know exactly what you're going to say so you can spare me the smart remarks."
"I don't know how you could let this happen in your own apartment, your own son."
"Oh, that's what this is about."
"Wendy, he's 15 years old, alright, almost 16."
He's got a girlfriend.
"Oh, you are genuinely sick if you think this is appropriate."
All I did was save our son 50 bucks on a room in some flea pit.
He's a kid.
He's in love with another kid.
With another kid?
!
Yes.
It's a girl in his English class.
He told me all about it.
"The girl from his English class is his fucking English teacher, you moron!"
Oh...
Those two.
"All right, ma'am, I've just spoken to Amy."
Her and Dan are with Pierce and his mom at the hospital.
- But there's been a holdup.
"- Oh, God."
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.
That evil bitch.
And Richard and Jonah are there.
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.
"Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup."
"Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something."
I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.
"- All right, stop it, Gary."
"- Okay, look, get Pierce here."
Okay?
Right now.
"I'm gonna take control of this situation that I don't know anything about, right?"
Because I am the only one who seems to be...
Capable.
"Oh, God."
Is it possible to stop coughing?
No!
- You are not taking him.
- His jittery ass is mine.
"- Guys, I'm right here."
"- I'm sorry, your jittery ass is the president's."
"You shouldn't even be here, Jonah, unless you're giving your brain to science."
"I'm here on behalf of the president, Amy."
Do you remember her?
She's the woman that would have fired you if you hadn't gone fucking Fukushima.
"That's right, we're on a mission."
I am surprised the two of you even found your way out of your own mothers' vaginas.
Tie it to Steve's leg.
"Now, I want everybody out of here."
We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
I'll get the men from the barracks.
You think you can snatch Dunbar?
Not from the S.S.
We're sure gonna make a stab at it.
"Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry, meet at the north latrine."
You'll all get your posts.
"Now, everybody start drifting out, one by one."
"Easy, boys, easy."
Disperse out there nicely.
"Remember, just because the Krauts are dumb that doesn't mean they're stupid."
- Ready?
-Roger.
"Okay, move out."
I don't know what your scheme is.
it sounds crazy.
"It may be, but it's better than having Dunbar dead."
I guess you're right.
How about me going out and keeping Schulz off balance?
- Good.
- I wouldn't worry about Schulz.
I'd worry about Sefton.
Remember me?
I'm the stoolie.
"You ain't gonna squeal this one, brother."
No?
Aren't you afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound?
"For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?"
"You're gonna stay here in the barracks, and not a peep out of you."
"Okay then, put a guard on me."
Come on.
Help me!
Those other girls already took them.
What?
"Well, at least we don't have to wear those ugly, yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding."
Yup.
"Now, you only have to wear ugly, yellow dresses here, every night."
This is the best thing that's happened to me since I realized that weird mole on my arm was just a Grape-Nut and not cancer.
"Girls, great news."
You stuffed Han in the microwave and you're ready to hit power?
Come on.
We've tried.
You know he doesn't fit.
The one thing he's too big for.
"No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be our wedding photographer."
He's the best photographer at The Warsaw Times.
"Well, he's the only one who still has both arms."
"Wait, it's the Warsaw Times?"
"All this time, I've been thinking it was The New York Times."
New York Times?
This is much more exclusive.
You can only get it in two places.
Poland and the deli in New Jersey that sells missiles.
This is amazing.
My comeback in The New York Times has been preserved.
"Max, I'm gonna go ahead and smile."
My life is good again.
"Don't smile yet, 'cause Sophie told me that because you said she had such good taste, she's designing our dresses herself."
"What was that, like a second?"
Yup.
You just went from the best of times to The Warsaw Times.
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
How are you feeling?
"- Thank god, fine."
You're still here?
- I have no complaints.
"Lights and electricity, nothing has changed."
How's your daughter?
Thank god.
She went to talk to Alex.
"Good, good."
It's good seeing you.
"- Yes, you too."
"Hello, everyone."
I'd like us to read the first act that I translated with the help of my daughter Goni who's sitting right here.
And that's my brother-in-law.
"I chose the cast with Alex, or rather at his recommendation, since I don't know any of you."
But...
The recommendations were very strong.
Yes.
"Hello, everyone."
Don't mind me.
"In any case, Alex suggested we read ""The Enchanted Nose"""
with the junior company.
I thought...
"Excuse me, dear actors,"
"I see you're taking the text out of the envelopes, is this the first time you've seen it?"
"I'm sorry, they only informed us yesterday, we're rehearsing all the time, you expect too much of us."
A serious actor is supposed to prepare at home.
"Yitzhak, don't be so hard on them."
"In the past, I would've got up and left."
"It's, uh, not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"
"Uh, do you like it?"
It-It is rather a fine one.
"- Oh, my."
"- S-Sorry, Grim."
"Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks."
"Ah, very amusing."
"Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?"
"Oh, you're gonna love it' Chef's been fixing his speciality: stuffed crab."

He'II even stay that way if you don't marry him.
"Yes, well, there's no danger of that."
The count won't divorce me.
"Since I Ieft him, he won't even allow me to see the children."
"well, now you've begun a new family."
"still, I prefer to be married."
I know you thumb your nose at all that.
It's funny.
I thought I'd die of suffocation when I was married.
Now it's my freedom that's killing me.
(baby cries)
Sophie!
"tell me, have you been invited to Angers next week?"
The Duke and Duchess d'Antan have asked us to their estate.
(baby screams)
Sophie!
Where is that wretch?
Excuse me.
Franz?
I will see you.
You're not going to Angers too?
Eugene!
A whole fortnight among some tiresome old aristocrats.
"A fortnight of free food, exquisite scenery and no bills."
And all you have to be is brilliant at dinner.
She doesn't seem bothered she's being eaten alive.
No.
"She'd probably say ""Better to feel something than nothing."""
Even if it's teeth.
(piano being played)
-You don't talk much.
-Neither do you.
You've figured it out haven't you?
"The less you say, the more people will reveal about themselves."
"Until little by little, they have divulged every last bit of who they are."
Because what people want most...
Is to be known.
"So, do you use that knowledge for good or for evil?"
I use it for myself.
Kiss me.
Where?
"Well, put your hands here, like that, and then"
I go like this.
"And you pull me in like that, and close your eyes."
-You wanna smoke a J?
"-No, that's not really my thing."
"You said you had a headache, though."
This is perfect for that.
"Honey, I'm already on so many painkillers;"
I don't need anything else.
"See, that's where you're wrong - marijuana is the safe alternative to that."
"Plus, you inhale it, so it works faster."
What the hell?
"Live dangerously, right?"
Ugh... it tastes like shit.
"No, no - it tastes good."
Actually I got it from my friend and he got it from a friend from another friend off the coast of Madagascar.
I guess it came up on a piece of driftwood.
I do feel better.
Is that- is that normal?
"Oh yeah, that's normal."
"Well, in that case."
What I will say is when we finished filming and I drove to the hotel
I always found myself getting into the Subaru.
I prefer the Impreza.
No idea why.
"It's like I prefer dark to milk chocolate,"
I prefer Bedford to Bruce Forsyth.
"Right, let's see if we can find out if there's any real difference between them on our test track."
Please say mushi mushi to Stig-San.
So first up the Impreza STi.
"This is the tweet one, remember."
And...
Oh dear.
"An emotional Stig this week, round Chicago."
This car does understeer so will that slow him down?
It is looking good so far.
Ooh.
He is...
He IS running wide there.
Into the penultimate corner.
"Come on, Stig, keep it tight."
There's loads of understeer and he goes round the finishing line!
Now what about the Evo VIII?
In the interests of fairness
I should say this isn't the car Jeremy drove in Scotland.
It's the 301bhp FQ version.
Very tidy round Chicago.
No trace of understeer as it smoothly powers through that hammer head.
TYRES SCREECH Good Lord!
"Screaming at the follow-through, a second faster than the Subaru."
Will it beat it?
Over the finish line.
I have the times here.
What about the Egyptian press?
What about the rest of the world?
They are colonialists.
I don't care if they have an agreement.
"These things are for Egypt, not for the amusement of a British aristocrat."
"Yes, monsieur, I understand."
Very well.
As you wish.
They say we must wait.
Go back to the tomb and watch them.
"If they break the terms of the concession in any way whatsoever, call me immediately."
The slightest infringement and we shall take control of the tomb.
You understand?
HOWARD:
We've counted over 600 objects in this room alone.
Everything has to be wrapped and protected.
"So far, we've used over half a mile of cotton wadding and 16 bales of calico, and we're only halfway through."
"- Good morning, gentlemen."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Howard."
- This is Harry Burton.
"If you need any photographs, speak to him."
I won't allow any other photographers in here.
"Oh, my God."
It's extraordinary.
"Carter, look at this."
"Oh, my God!"
"Evelyn, come and see this."
"Oh, that's beautiful."
Aren't they lovely?
HOWARD:
This must be his wife.
"They called me Minx, sent me to New York, and I sent money home to mother and she stopped crying."
That's when I learned that the best medicine is money.
Money.
I still dream of being a psychiatrist.
Because I think I could help people with their problems.
Really I do.
Do you?
"I've been developing my ideas, Michelangelo."
And I'm here to make a proposal to you.
I've seen your site.
"Yes, I have."
"I know my way around the web, all right."
"Now if you put your mind to it, you could become one of our brand-awareness operators, Michelangelo."
You could become... an influencer.
Do you know what that is?
That is a kid who sets a trend.
And we employ a lot of them.
"Now tell me, OK, honestly."
How many hits did your site have yesterday?
Wow!
Really?
"You see, I knew that the youth market was the niche to explore."
It is just where the numbers are...
"Except for the ageing population, of course."
Wow!
That just came to me.
Geriatrics!
"They sure need fragrance, right?"
"See, Michelangelo, you have to think ahead in the world of the new."
That's a pity it's not called N.
"""N is for new."""
But then that wouldn't work for the old.
"Do not break glass and kill the bee, you guys have... kill it... kill or i will give you a slap under you ear."
"Sir, she is gone..."
Chandu do something.
See the diamond's worth is 200000000/- it will be gone with the car.
Now every thing is in God's hand.
God...
"God... do something, anything... excuse me."
You?
You?
Both of you are here you should be shame of yourself.
You killed that sweet and innocent Laxmi Narayan and fled?
Having the punishment for that same sin.
Actually we thought he is the Laxmi Narayan who was about to buy car.
But he was not that Laxmi Narayan.
Which car?
"A green old broken car, couldn't sale even 7 months."
"If it could not sale for two day more, that would be nice."
Are you talking about 6121?
"Yeah, how you know?"
That's my car.
I will transfer all the balance to AMI 200000000/-!
"If you will take 75°/°, that would be good too."
All right give the 5°/°.
"In 1000000/- really, paper are ready too."
And Laxmi Narayan would be on his way at 4 o'clock with money.
Here's the 50°/° from advance.
"Its not nursery now, i have changed my mind, i don't want to sale my car."
Here's the car's papers read it.
I don't want to sale my car!
I am taking this car.
That's my car.
"I made it car, see this, i have made the headlights, and the paint too."
LAUGHTER
This is the same studio we film Pointless.
Where David is sitting there is roughly where I sit.
"Jessica is roughly where the column is, and if you look under your desk, that's Alexander Armstrong's secret coke stash."
LAUGHTER
Does this remind you of anything?
HE MOCKS RICHARD
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
That's a little harsh.
I mean...
"listen, it looked like me."
I don't think it sounded like me.
LAUGHTER
"So, I've knocked the microphone off in trying to do an impersonation."
"Yeah, you know what?"
"It's harder to be me than it looks, my friend."
"Sorry, do you think your impression was so good you dropped the mic?"
LAUGHTER
"Literally, our sound department has just gone, ""Aww."""
LAUGHTER
Should we treat ourselves to a little look at Pointless?
Check this out.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many words ending in 'ZZ.'
"OK, so I have a word, um..."
"But, again, it's sort of slangy, maybe slightly profane."
So what do I do about that?
What's your counsel?
"Hey listen, my counsel is..."
LAUGHTER
"My counsel, if it's going to score you 250 quid, fabulous."
"So, I'm going to go with jizz."
"Yes, Inspector."
This way.
"We are too late, Inspector."
"Search the entire hotel, they must not be far."
Let's go!
Wait!
"Listen, Inspector, it's Adriana's beacon, we have a lead,come!"
"Based on the distance and heading, they are driving towards Guayaquil."
"To Guayaquil, are you sure?"
"That is what I believe, Inspector."
"Hold all flights, no one must leave."
"Advise the patrol boats, we will comb the entire Guayaquil."
"Is she ready, does she have petrol?"
"Yes sir, shall I accompany you?"
I would not recommend it.
"Quickly, push off the boat."
Call the pilots and advise them to be ready.
Yes.
Ms. Bristol.
"HQ to flies, HQ to flies, HQ to flies"
"Flies to HQ, go ahead."
"This is an emergency, have plane 336 ready to carry out plan two."
We will carry out plan two.
Have them send a plane to cover us if needed.
"Send a plane to protect us if necessary, on the river."
"Understood, we will be ready."
"Captain, radar registers a light craft that is closing in fast to our stern."
Its Dinamo.
Prepare arms!
Battlestations!
"Attention, light helicopters,patrol entire sector."
"Attention, Yacht club, attention, Yacht club."
Give it up for...
The amazing Mr Lifto
"It's not my call but for security reasons, you guys have to leave there."
It's all good...
"Dude, that was my beer."
This song's about.... fucking...
I'm drunk.
And right now I'm so (in love with you).
And I (don't want to think too much about what we...) ...should or shouldn't do.
"Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars,"
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel...
Thanks man.
"What did you throw up, man, what did you throw?"
Can I have a towel in exchange?
Thanks man...
I swear.
Right now I found everything I need.
"The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins... are listening to me."
Well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown.
My moral standing is lying down.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
-Naked!
No.
Where is he?
Open.
Open.
Open.
Open!
I am Dr. Cicchirini.
It is possible to be known what happens?
"Ah, Doctor."
You what makes here?
The washbasins of the beadles are down.
"Doctor, already knows that I undergo hypertrophy to the prostate."
"Commonly call prostatismo, whose symptoms is:"
"first, frequent necessity to tinkle, secondly, difficulty in starting up the urinary flow."
Him memory that the classes occur in the classroom and that you not even are authorized.
Have you seen a naked man enter?
-A naked man?
-Naked.
It often happens to him to see naked men?
"Good, in fact, lately, there has been a case in that..."
"But, what makes say me?"
You are a dummy.
It is not allowed to return to take that class from confidences.
"It remembers that you it is not more than a beadle, however I am Dr. Cicchirini."
Benito.
"Benito, hears..."
Ben.
You must call Ben to me.
How I must say it?
In agreement.
You do not cause that the faults of the parents fall on the children.
You know that.
"Does it really matter, Jamal?"
It don't matter if it matters.
It's corporate.
Take it to go.
Can I have my check?
Wipe that down before you leave.
Is this both weeks?
Jamal:
Same as always.
"You don't know me, but this is not me."
I don't suffer complicated women.
"But Laura, you know, she's got me..."
She's got me making exceptions.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?
Yes.
- And he owns the house.
- Correct.
- And they're not fucking?
- Nope.
"So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?"
"Yo, I got to find me a guy like this."
You think she's full of shit?
"Look, I don't know her."
"No, but I'm asking for your opinion 'cause my instincts are askew."
"No dude's ever given me anything for free, period."
"If she's fucking him, I don't know when she's doing it because I'm with her all the fucking time."
"Well, she's not with you now."
"What, you don't think people fuck during the daytime?"
[Blender whirring]
Of course.
"I mean, people fuck at all times."
I was just making sure you were alive.
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home.
"And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too."
"It wasn't a party, it was one guy."
Don't be so judgey.
I talked to Roberta at the Grill and... there's still a bartending position open.
If you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I work there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Don't act so surprised.
"- Well, I mean, I just..."
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there's back grant due."
"- It's back in everything, mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- That's Caroline.
Easy.
"Yeah, come in."
"Okay, we're gonna be late, so, let's just get going."
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts me down."
Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
I don't know.
"He waited 145 years, only to find out that Katherine could not care less."
"That's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
"You don't keep a lot of old, useless paperwork around, do you?"
I have found shredders to be quite useful in eliminating clutter.
"- Miles, what's happening?"
- Did I say something was happening?
"If I knew something was happening and I told you, then I might be seen to be conspiring with you, which, of course, I never would."
Conspiring with me?
About what?
Conspiring with you?
About what?
"Miles, are you trying to scare the bejesus out of me?"
"Hard drives are particularly vexing when it's time for spring cleaning, though I understand there's software available for that purpose."
"- Miles, what is happening?"
- l'm off to a lunch now.
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello and let you know I'm thinking of you.
Karen?
Hi. I'm Bob Dumanjik.
- How are you?
- l'm fine.
Thanks for coming down.
- l know you're really busy.
- You do?
"Well, I assume it."
Should I not assume it?
Are you secretly lazy?
"Um, this way."
Stop it.
Not you.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Of course, it's always a mess around here."
Go ahead and sit.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Oh!
You have to use some kind of protection or you are going to be--
"Mom, I am not having sex, all right?"
Really!
I am not even close to an embarrassing degree.
Okay.
"I am sorry, honey."
I want you to be prepared when the time comes.
- Whenever the time comes.
"- lt will never come, not with Jordan."
- ls that what is bothering you?
"- No, nothing is bothering me."
- Something is bothering you.
"- Mom, you couldn't possibly..."
"understand or help. I don't mean to hurt your feelings so just, please?"
I am here if you need me.
You know that.
- That is good to know about.
- Yeah.
My uncle choked on a chicken bone.
"That's when the change happened, J ust like that,"
"Somewhere ln those few seconds, I knew my life would never be the same,"
- Did he survive?
- Yeah.
"I knew then that the rumor was right, Not ln actuality, but ln my heart,"
"Because at that moment I would have done anything, I wanted him so much,"
"Look, I didn't say anything about, you know."
- l know.
- l just wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
Because I'm not like that.
I don't do that.
No.
"It's me, José."
- They've asked for reinforcements.
- Smithy.
"- OK, I'll deal with it."
- Show me what we have to do next.
Can you see those iron girders down there?
The inspection tunnel is on the same level.
That's the most vulnerable part of the dam.
The water pressure will destroy the rest.
- It takes a long time to build one of those.
- I don't care.
Do you care that many innocent people are going to die down there?
Why did he say that?
He'd do anything to reach his goal too.
- He's like a leopard.
"- Yes, intrepid and merciless."
I wouldn't like to be his enemy.
"Hey, Jaime!"
"The explosive has to be attached to the end of the girders, understood?"
Make sure nobody surprises us.
I'll stay here.
Everybody take cover!
"Hurry, Jaime!"
There's at least ten of them.
They're in control of the dam.
Wake up!
I can't shoot without hitting our own men.
Some of you must go to the other side!
- The convoy mustn't go onto the dam.
- Too late.
"Hey, look!"
Over there!
I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?"
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.
Really?
In front of your sister?
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.
Excuse me.
I'm going to go wander the streets alone.
"Invisible, unwanted and unloved;"
a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.
I don't understand.
Is this a way to break in new shoes?
No.
"Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off."
"Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
The what?
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.
Message received.
"Commence operation ""Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."""
Hey.
Seriously?
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
I wish.
A clique requires friends.
- I didn't have any.
- None?
hey hate dancing  with a passion and it goes to a whole sort of different level.
Can we just put that in?
Some point in the--
That's the dinosaur.
It's a bird pecking the sea.
"No, the bird, you dance out here, and the dinosaur's this."
I Iove how we basically take the piss out of dance moves.
And the winner:
Zayn MaIik.
"Okay, from the top."
When you go on tour the outfit you've got's the outfit you're stuck with so I'm gonna be wearing these clothes for a good eight months now.
Is this working?
Can you get in?
I feel weird wearing a trench coat.
It's the Harry styles look.
It looks good.
You look like one of those adverts.
You do though.
"here's been times when they've dressed us all in the same clothes and we're like, "" No, we can't do that."""
This is the:
""" I'm gonna rob your nan"" look."
"This T is bad, though."
I Iike this T-shirt.
-Is it not happening?
-They're a bit tight.
I just wanna see for the look.
"Oh, my God."
e have to be our own people.
I don't think this band would've worked if we wasn't because as soon as someone tries to tell us  what to do....
"Now do a normal one, please, honey."
It's like having five rowdy boys in a class at school.
Honey please.
"You see,"
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Come on.
Home sweet home.
It's a shit-hole.
"Yes, but it's our shit-hole, so show some manners."
"I could tell you many stories about cheap BB's like this, George, many stories."
And I don't want to hear any of them.
"- Well, hello."
"- Oh, I thought I heard the door."
"Well, did you hear my heart begin to beat a little faster?"
"No, no."
"No, definitely the door."
You sure it wasn't the buttons on my fly pinging off one by one?
"You know, because of... my lob-on?"
"Oh, you filthy little..."
"- Annie, this is Adam."
- Hello.
Adam is a vampire.
- Isn't that fantastic
- Yeah.
Adam is going to be staying with us for as short a time as possible.
Upstairs.
You can find a room to sit and think about the way you've just behaved.
"- Catch you later, sweet cheeks."
- Go.
- Don't ask.
- OK.
Have you any idea of the trouble your little escapade has caused?
"I mean, have you seen a newspaper in the last four weeks?"
"This is the biggest manhunt for a century, and you're strutting around in broad daylight."
What happens when the police catch up with you?
"But I usually walk barefoot, even with snow and rain."
My feet are far from the head so I do not have to think much about it.
"Thank you so much, mayor."
- Thanks for the hospitality.
Thank you and God bless you.
- Thanks so much.
This was...
Belgian television in Bulgaria.
Carlos?
Sire?
Do you believe in real privilege?
I believe in her.
As a person.
I mean...
The institution that unites people.
Louise?
Do you believe in the monarchy?
"For me, it is not a question of believing, but of respecting it, sire."
Is it your personal opinion?
"Yes, it is my personal opinion."
Ludovic?
What do you think?
The monarchy
"Is the highest expression of dignity,"
"Of grace,"
Great ideas!
The coincidence of the universe and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature...
"If you let me, sire..."
We will have to present it to the Prime Minister because...
We do not have time.
We will have a little while we return.
That's why it's Yiddish.
I didn't know you'd taken up the language.
Abe laid it on me.
Abe's a good man.
"You're a good man, Pappy."
Underneath that Louisiana cane syrup plain red dirt.
"Not that different from the pavements of Astoria, where I'm from."
You and me are sticking by Judge Walter Stern.
"Man, thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return."
If there's anything I can do please feel free to call.
- Thank you.
- It's the least we can do.
Good morning.
Where's the mayor?
He had to go Washington on convention business.
This rates an inspector's funeral and that includes the mayor.
The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern for Mrs. Santos and her children.
Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers?
At school they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer.
We'll get our press people right on it.
What about Internal Affairs?
What are those clowns doing?
Where you going?
- City.
- I thought we were in the city.
Not if you're from Queens.
Let's start over.
Where you going?
Manhattan.
Hop in.
Go fuck yourself.
"Not to be disrespectful but the Transportation Department wasn't prepared for 1,000 people."
Thirty.
Convention's coming to town.
You gonna be all right?
Thanks for asking. I'll be fine.
"Damage control, remember."
Damage control.
-You look good.
-Of course. I'm the mayor.

There were explosive developments  with the incident at Broadway and Marcy.
"The revelation of a missing probation report may result in the handing up of indictments by the grandjury of Supreme Court Judge Stern and Brooklyn Democratic leader, Frank Anselmo."
"His connections  to Mafia chieftain, Paul Zapatti, are certain to be examined."
Sources say the career of the political boss is over and a long prison term is in the offing.
Chester?
"Chester, what are you doing?"
Did Mommy let you out?
Did she?
And how was your day today?
Give me a kiss.
"You okay, Frank?"
"Fine, sweetheart. I'm fine."
It's been on the TV all morning.
"Yeah, I know. I heard."
I fixed you some osso buco.
I had a feeling you might come home for lunch today.
"- I'll be there, but I can't ask you."
- Why not?
"Well, my mother."
Your mother.
"Well, she wouldn't actually forbid it."
It's just that she gets jealous of anybody at all that I spend my time with.
You don't know her.
You don't have to live with her.
But she's my mother.
There's nothing I can do about that.
"You don't have to tell me any more, Norman."
"Please, Allison, I've gotta tell somebody."
She won't let me have friends.
She... .
She makes me tell her 10 times a day how much I love her.
She's afraid she'll die alone in a poorhouse.
And marriage... .
"Marriage, she says, is misery."
And a woman can only cause me trouble.
"Oh, Norman, I can't believe it."
Nobody would.
"Now maybe you know why I hate to go home and why I live in the library and why I can't dance, or kiss girls, or look anybody in the eye."
"You see, I'm a sissy and a coward."
"No, you're not, Norman."
No one around town stopped to think and give you a chance.
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.
"I know, but I am, and I don't know what I can do about it."
- I know what you can do.
- What?
You can start with me.
I'll prove everything your mother ever said was wrong.
"Would you kiss me, Norman?"
You can't just give your sperm to two girls you met in a cafe.
I met you in a cafe.
I just feel like you shouldn't be doing this.
The world is overpopulated.
You know there's an island of plastic the size of Texas in the pacific.
"I know, Leah."
You told me this 1000 times.
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying.
Overpopulation is important to me.
"Look, I don't think that me giving these lesbians one illegitimate child is gonna add that much plastic."
You have two children.
Why can't I have one?
But you haven't thought this through.
You don't listen to me.
I do listen.
I've heard everything you've said.
Really?
You don't listen listen.
I want you to go for therapy.
"Oh, God."
I'll trade you therapy for sex.
It's been almost three weeks.
I think it's sweet you know how long it's been.
Let's get a drink.
- Keep an eye out for Jarmusch.
- There's a lot of good-looking women... much better than at book parties.
Goodbye.
- White wine?
- Yeah.
Why is it wherever I go I look for Suzanne?
Because your heart's broken.
You're looking for the piece that is her to put it back together.
Her and my grandpa own a bunch of them.
"This is supposed to be the model home, but it never got finished."
Why?
"Did someone die here, and now it's haunted?"
"Yes, that's exactly what happened."
What did happen?
I don't know.
How do contractors just disappear?
"If we don't have a model home, we don't have a new development."
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.
You know where to reach me.
No luck with the contractors?
Vanished.
My father's never gonna let me hear the end of this.
Did you talk to Seth?
I think so.
But don't blame yourself.
I'm not blaming myself.
But how can I allow a strange boy to live in this house?
Seth needs to know it's what any mother would do.
I was talking about the contractors.
So you want him to stay here?
"Well, I mean, I know the place needs some sprucing up, but..."
"God, did I just say ""sprucing""?"
"So, Ryan, what do you think?"
I haven't really had time to think.
But how much better is this place than some group home?
And wait till you see the best part.
It's an empty pool.
To some people.
"So, your mom."
These people can make putting on your pants seem like a criminal conspiracy.
Forget it.
You had to be in the room to understand.
Okay.
Sorry.
- Did something happen in this room?
- l just told you what happened.
"I know, but you sounded like you were afraid, like something happened."
I don't know if you're afraid you can't tell me or that you have to protect me.
"I mean, I just..."
- l don't know what I'm saying.
"- You know that I'm with you, right?"
"I mean, God forbid you were to get indicted or, worst-case scenario..."
"- l don't know, that..."
- Say it.
- Say what?
- Go ahead.
Say it.
"Worst-case scenario, I go to prison."
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you were saying.
- Am I going to prison?
- You're not.
"If I am, then how does that affect you and your kids"
- and whether you marry me or not?
- No.
I would think about it too.
"You should be, because I sure am."
You're scaring me now.
I don't want to talk to you when you're like this.
"It's okay. I... I feel like I should go home, anyway."
- l don't think you should.
I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.
And sitting with my feet on the floor.
"Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine."
"Hey, look, I have peach schnapps."
Thank God.
"Guys, something happened."
What's wrong?
I think a boy likes me.
"""Hi."
It's Stuart.
"""We met at the comic book store."
"""I was wondering if you'd like"
"""to get coffee sometime."
"""It's okay if you say no."
"""It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft."""
"Amy, little vixen."
Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
"Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend;"
she has a Sheldon.
So do you like Stuart?
I don't know.
He's nice.
He's funny.
"He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland."
That's kind of hot.
"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now."
"If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
"Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged like me and Howie."
Why is that lady rubbing on someone else's body?
Yoon Jae!
Da Ran...
You came?
Hello.
I came to see Yoon Jae.
What are you thinking coming here by yourself without saying anything?
!
I had no idea that he was a doctor!
And I came to see my body!
Your body?
"What, you don't think I'd be curious to see if my body's doing okay?"
And there's a precious personal item that I have to find too!
Then...
Follow me this way.
Hurry up and put this on.
"But, Teacher Gil..."
"There's a girl doctor among his friends, right?"
She's a little strange.
There's something weird about her touch.
Kang Gyung Joon.
You made my Yoon Jae be called an idiot...
Now you're even trying to get him to be called sneaky?
Sneaky?
!
Boys your age...
"I understand that when a girl even lays a finger on you, you think it's a turn-on."
Since I'm a high school teacher.
"But if you look at Yoon Jae's friend in that way with Yoon Jae's eyes, what do you think she'll think of my Yoon Jae?"
There's your disillusion growing again!
"You know very well boys my age are more likely to act out the more you act like that, right teacher?"
"Idiotic, sneaky and now incapable..."
"So, from now on, I will try to trust you, wherever you go and whatever you do."
So...
"Soo Bin, I would like it if you trusted me too."
I won't run away again.
So... from now on...
Believe in me.
Please.
Han Gyul.
The guy you beat up last time...
- The one I fought...
- The one you fought...
Choi Chan Gyu...
He wants to fight you one more time.
"The reason you keep failing your exam... is because you spend all your time working part-time jobs, isn't it?"
There's nothing I can do about that.
Don't you regret giving up that special position at the agency?
I don't regret it.
"If I took that, that would mean I would never see you or Shi Yoon again."
"Especially you, Jung Yeon."
You're even supplying the entertainment.
You seem to be having a blast.
You said you wanted to fight.
Are you on a date instead?
Jung Yeon.
"It's dangerous, go over there."
"Hey, speak with some respect."
Isn't it obvious that I'm older than you?
I'm taller too.
I'll keep these guys out of it.
"We'll fight, one on one."
- Since you asked for it.
- What if I win?
Jing-Mei was first on the scene.
- Is she okay?
- A little freaked.
"I don't get it, man, how you could just roll over."
- That's the way it works sometimes.
"- Yeah, if you let it."
"- What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit?"
- That's one way to fight it.
- There is no fighting it.
"- You know, I don't buy that."
Carter wants the output on Bed 4 before he leaves.

"And if it happens to you enough, you get the message."
You are not equal.
You are not a full citizen.

A suspect.
You sure you wanna wait out here?
"Yeah, there's too many sick people in there."
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Hey.
Cold enough for you?
My mom went ahead to help set up stuff for the home hospice team.
- Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
- I think you' re doing the right thing.
I think it doesn't matter what you think.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
Guess it all just feels so much more real now.
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.
10-4 and out.
DUD:
Just give the names of the two suspects.
"Ray Malcolm and Lane ""Pluto"" Franklin."
Give a description of the girl and say the victims were stabbed to death.
How many stab wounds?
"No, don't mention that, or the hog-tying or the pillowcases."
What about the three other victims?
Just say they were strangled.
And what about the kid?
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor and that we think the suspects fled the state.
Might get us some national coverage and make it hard for them to travel.
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.
Okay.
Play it up that they're as violent as we've ever seen.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's the story on this Star City thing?
"Somebody, come on."
Dud?
Would it be a wild goose chase if you went down there?
"We've been lucky so far, and we can tie Ray there."
The police chief in Star City said he didn't know of Ray or Fantasia but he thought he'd heard of the uncle and was going to check them out.
I'm just waiting for his phone call back.
What about an ID on the second suspect?
JOHN:
"They call him ""Pluto."""
His real name is Lane Franklin.
No.
You said he'd missed his tram.
No.
"You did, Mr Kirkby."
We had a whole conversation about it.
I might have been hallucinating.
Hallucinating?
From shellshock.
Do you suffer from shellshock?
Occasionally.
I can't let you back in.
I know.
She's stuck in there with that idiot.
I want to rescue her.
I want to run away with her.
Does SHE know that?
Probably not.
"The whole thing's been a series of half-cocked blunders, of which me shoving him in the chest and failing to give him a cactus is the last in a long line."
"Well, she's only on the first floor."
Doesn't matter what floor she's on if you can't let me back in.
"Of course, if you were to rush past me, grab a decorator's ladder and put it up against her window, there wouldn't be much I could do about it."
Wouldn't there?
I'm not very quick on my pins.
I don't have the full complement.
Caught a packet in the first lot.
Sniper.

"Go on, chump."
Oh...
"Can you hold the door, love?"

"- What a way to die,"
- mauled to death...
- Henry... you don't know that's what happened.
"You didn't see it, George."
Those terrible scratches on his face alone would let you know if you did.
Sir.
"What have you, George?"
"Sir, the man who discovered him was checking his snares this morning."
"He seemed surprised, almost disappointed to find out he'd snagged a human."
I suppose he was expecting his dinner.
Right.
Have him come down to the Station House for a word.
Do we know the victim's identity yet?
"He has nothing on his person, sir."
"We searched the area for his wallet, no luck."
"Judging by the scratches on his face,"
I'd say he was attacked by an animal of some kind.
"- Higgins has a theory, sir."
"- Uh, George..."
Does it pertain to this case?
"He certainly thinks it does, he hasn't shut up about it."
(Higgins sighs.)
Henry?
"Sir, it's like a..."
I only saw it for a minute.
Saw what?
"You better follow me, sir."
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, earl."
You really are crazy.
Who in the hell would the government send?
"Kent MansIey, unexplained Phenomena."
-Marv Loach.
I--
-What happened?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'II snap if the weather is bad, sure."
But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that... .
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.
What do you think?
Escaped gorilla?
What department is that again?
I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of my agency...
... andallthatthatimplies.
You mean national security?
Let's put it this way.
"Once in a while, things happen..."
... thatcan'tbe rationalized in a conventional way.
people wanna know the government has a response.
I am that response.
So were there any witnesses?
"well, sir, if you'II just follow me."
We did find this.
"United States Government, huh?"
Guess that means something big's happening here.
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
That's need-to-know.
"You can't pull that one with me,jethro."
I'm your boss.
"Iraq standinby,ma'am."
I got your e-mail concerning nce corporal finn.
I assume you've been over his srb.
"Yeah,we have,skipper."
We'd like to know what's not on the record.
Finn wasn't one of my stronger marines.
Wasn't surprised he went ua.
He have any enemies in the company?
He was well-liked.Played poker.
"Not well,but covered his debts."
Liked to talk about his sexual exploits in detail.
You know how marines love at.
"How does a dead marine,stateside, send letters home from iraq?"
Wondered about that myself.
"Get over here,marine."
Sir.
"Meet lance corporal hagan,soon to be priva hagan."
"Before deployment,finn gave him a couple hundred bucks to pop letters in the mail to two women the first batch started six months ago."
"The second,three months later."
Got enough to last the st of our deployment.
Gonna need those.
Send 'em on the next flight out.
Two fic?
s... that a marinthing?
"That's need-to-know,too,director."
- Do you see it yet?
- No.
Keep looking.
"Abby,I've been staring at this thing for five minutes."
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilde's having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Am I to tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
"Mr.Zuloaga tried to dissuade him, but Benigno wouldn't listen, he was very upset."
He also said he knew a lot of married couples who didn't get along half as well as he and Alicia.
"JORDAN, EIGHT MONTHS LATER"
"Lydia Gonzalez was buried yesterday, April 13, in the Almudena cemetery."
"The 33-year-old bullfighter, daughter of Antonio Gonzalez, had been in a coma since..."
"""The Forest"" Clinic."
May I speak to Benigno Martin?
He's on the 2nd floor.
- He doesn't work here anymore.
"- Excuse me, miss..."
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
- And Nurse Rosa?
- Who's calling?
Push it!
No brandy!
But-- but the pain!
Maybe you'd better let your little brazilian butcher boy do it.
"You remove it, my boy."
I can't work runder these circumstances.
Forgive me.
"Well, community?"
Tonight we stuff ourselves and drink captain taylor's brandy!
Here.
Thank you.
Save your strength.
You're going to need it.
Captain taylor!
My name's crusoe.
Where'd you come from?
"I'm a castaway on this island, but I'm here to help you."
- Are you alone?
- No.
There's more than one of you?
Just.
You're an optimist.
"If I help you regain command of your ship,"
I need your word that you'll take my companion and myself off this island with you when you set sail.
"You have it, sir."
"Jacob moore, the leader of the mutineers, is as desperate a black heart as ever lived."
"A few of the men follow him through allegiance, the rest obey him simply through fear."
I'm working on a plan.
"Until I come back, you stay here."
I will return.
"Good, sir."
Is this an old cannibal trick?
What is it?
Lady Yuhwa requests your audience.
A terrible rumor about Jumong is spreading through the Palace.
Have you heard it?
Have you?
I think something bad has happened to Jumong.
Something bad?
What's that?
From what I've heard...
I think Jumong is dead.
Yuhwa.
I don't buy it.
"But if you say so, I'll gladly check his corpse."
I'll let go of all the hard feelings if you let me and Yesoya leave.
Yuhwa.
You won't need hostages now thatJumong's dead.
Let us go.
I can't.
Your Majesty.
Jolbon will turn into a battlefield the minute the Han and Puyo attack.
"If you go now, I can't guarantee your safety."
I know how you feel but I can't send you to your death.
Do you really know how I feel?
Do you know what it feels like to hear of your son's death?
I'm just as sad as you are.
I tried to sever my ties with him but he's still my son.
I'll protect you and Yesoya.
I'll raise Yuri to make up for it.
If you really thought of Jumong as your son... then you wouldn't dare wage war against the Damul Army.
Please.
Stop deceiving yourself.
"You say you're protecting me, but you're making my life a living hell."
Yeah?
"For years, I've been cheating on you."
"Well, I cheated on you with more than one guy!"
With two...
You had a three-way with two dudes?
"No, no!"
But I would have!
I totally would have!
"Well, I would've, too!"
Not with two dudes!
You know what I'm talking about!
"I thought I needed to know what it was like out there, in a real way, not like I read it in Cosmo."
So I went out there and I lived it.
I've had one-night stands!
Okay.
I've woken up in beds with men whose names I didn't even remember!
"I was like, ""'How did I get this T-shirt on?"
",'"
"Jennifer, I get it."
Land your plane.
Just deal with it!
You deal with it.
You deal...
You deal with going to Applebee's alone.
What?
"If you don't put in effort, you're gonna be the one who ends up at Applebee's alone."
Are you asking me to go to Applebee's with you?
The bottom line is that none of them made me feel the love that you did.
And I had to go out into the world in order for me to come back and say that I belong home.
Now I'm gonna keep on spinning these fly tunes until somebody gets something going on!
I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!
"Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!"
I was afraid of people walking in the streets.
"The more movement I saw around me, the more I wanted to be still."
I'm sure things weren't as bad as I remember them now.
Are you coming to the rehearsal?
-Well...
One of the songs is going to amaze you.
Then I'll go for sure.
Even now I can't understand everything that happened back then.
I felt such panic I wanted to go back to the madhouse.
Stop thinking about it.
The funniest thing was when Laura left that guy...
She almost reproached me for my apathy.
Are you writing in your diary?
How do you know I have a diary?
You told me.
I'm sure I didn't tell you anything.
But are you writing it?
Yes.
And what is it about?
About what happens to me.
Some stuff.
You're not very talkative today.
I'm upset.
With me?
With mom.
Don't tell her about the diary.
I won't.
You always end up telling her everything.
- I won't say a word.
She'd start asking... and as I won't say anything she'd look for it everywhere.
Did you hide it?
Don't think I'm gonna tell you where it is.
"Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you."
"That is, he's got to kiss you."
"Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love."
"If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently."
"But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!"
"No, Ariel!"
[muffled]
Have we got a deal?
"If I become human,"
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
"[Chuckles] Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?"
[Cackles]
Oh!
And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
"Just a token really, a trifle."
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
"- You've got it, sweetcakes."
"No more talking, singing."
Zip!
"But without my voice, how can I..."
"You'll have your looks, your pretty face."
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Ha!

What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
- Excuse me?
- London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya.
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
- I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
- We need the information on Latif.
- And fuck you.
"Yeah, in latex, I know."
Shall we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
Dieter's file say that he was a chopper pilot.
"It's a long shot but they might have a bird out here, to extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange."
How unfortunate that you killed him then.
Is it worth a hand job if I didn't?
"Hello, Dieter."
I'm Colonel Grant.
British Military Intelligence.
Don't move.
"Please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you."
It's a very nasty way to go.
It's just insurance.
You were going to kill my men after all.
- No.
"We weren't, we..."
"- Shh, shh, shh, shh."
Now I can choose not to kill you.
So shall we discuss where your transport is?
Here he is.
He waded in the water to help someone out.
He was helping them onto the boat-- they're here.
They made it home.
But he took a bullet.
"It came out of I don't know where, and..."
"He was as near to me as you are, and I saw the light go out of his eyes."
"But I said I'd bring him back, and I brought him back, even though it meant taking up space that could have been used by someone else."
Here he is.
Edith:
Dead?
Foyle:
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
But why?
He weren't a soldier.
The war was nothing to do with him.
Why did he have to go?
"Well, he believed it was right."
"Edith, whatever Margaret Ellis has told you, there isn't going to be a German invasion now, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps not ever."
How did she frighten you into cutting the wires?
She didn't.
What did she say was going to happen to you when the Germans came?
Nothing.
"She knew, didn't she?"
She knew that your grandmother is Jewish?
She said I wouldn't be allowed to work anymore.
She said I'd be put in a camp...
[Sobbing]
"That she wanted to look after me, but first, I'd have to prove myself..."
Do something to show I was on her side.
I didn't think it would matter that much.
and you call yourself a hero?
anyone not suited to fight this battle should disappear early on.
Well said.
Archer?
I am compelled by Command Seal not to fight you.
I would die just like Rider.
Saber?
that's enough.
My alliance with Emiya-kun is only until we defeat the Master hiding in the school.
Or what?
Do you want to force me to use another Command Seal on you?
Perhaps.
I got carried away teasing her.
Saber.
as well.
I shall overlook your words.
the first thing we need to do is locate her Master.
Caster's Master comes to this school every day.
we should let them be.
In other words we attack before they can return to Ryuudou Temple?
Exactly.
won't they stop coming to school because it's too risky?
That's unlikely.
I doubt Caster's Master still possesses their free will.
That's her style.
Her very first move was probably to turn her Master into a puppet.
That makes sense.
we'll continue our investigation of the school.
we strike.
but how do we look for them?
That's our homework for next time.
We're all tired.
"We're still pulling what's left of him from the truck wreckage,"
But we were able to lift some prints
From the passports that I found.
We had a vodka bottle.
"Plus, we got this beauty."
Don't touch.
What did the lab rats say?
They think it's some kind of long-range transmitter.
How long?
Moscow-long?
Run his picture by your embassy friend.
I'm on it.
"Hey, passport guy's mine."
You got any friends in moscow?
Or anywhere else?
Don't be that guy.
Ran the license plate we pulled from the roxxon debris.
Belongs to howard stark.
I found that.
Where's the rest of the car?
"Uh, we just got a plate and a bumper."
"Boss, stark was on the lam when roxxon went down."
Do we really think he would risk his freedom to blow it up?
Or in...
whatever the hell happened.
Somebody was driving that car.
I want to know who.
"Edwin, leave the dishes."
I can take care of it.
"Anna, darling, I'm going to take you up on that offer."
The day beckons.
"I'll, uh, be in the garden."
"Uh, we're not supposed to have any of that."
The Mokra don't allow it.
They can't have control of everything.
Surely there's someone who has an illegal transmitter.
I know what you'd like...
some talsa root soup.
Can you at least tell me what happened to the other people
I was with on the street?
You really should be more careful out there.
Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason.
I don't want you getting hurt...again.
But I saw the way you handled that ugly one.
I couldn't have done any better.
"I was so proud of you, Ralkana."
My two friends...
did the Mokra take them?
I'm afraid so.
Where would they have been taken?
A detention center?
The prison.
All right.
How do I get there?
Soup.
I'm forgetting the soup.
"I appreciate your hospitality, but I can't stay here."
I've got to get to that prison.
"You're right, the time has come."
"Now we're together again, we can't wait another day."
My beautiful and brave...
girl.
The Mokra won't stand a chance against us.
"You're very kind to offer, but I didn't mean we'd be going together."
- Giant oysters are the best.
- Some of them were humongous.
- Big oysters.
""" 15,000 kroner for legal assistance."" Okay."
- For what?
- That matter with the mouth painter.
- Fine.
You want the money up front?
- No.
We talked about it the locker room.
I thoroughly explained your options according to the law.
I'm afraid you're going to have to tell me again.
I didn't hear it.
- Weren't you listening?
- I didn't hear a word.
"Bloody hell, Frank."
"Casper, you were there."
I remember you standing there...
I couldn't quite concentrate because you weren't wearing any trousers.
- So...
- You're making me feel ill at ease.
There I was explaining things and you just stared at my crotch.
- You were very close to me.
- We're all guys in the locker room.
"Mads told me how to deal with the mouth painter, in the locker room."
I had his pecker in my face so I didn't hear a word.
"Oh, come on."
I quietly told you what to do...
"Save it for the locker room, please."
I'm going to take this and leave.
Nice to see you.
"- Give me the bill, Mads."
Take charge of the starboard gangway.
- Keep the prisoner below.
- Flagship's jolly boat alongside!
- Take me to the captain!
"- This way, sir."
"He came with the prize-ships, and stayed with the admiral."
- I've brought an urgent dispatch.
- Give that to me.
It's happened!
They've done it at Spithead!
The fleet mutinied!
- The Admiralty agreed to this?
"- Every item, sir."
All you asked for.
Look.
Full pardon for all those involved has been signed by His Majesty the king.
"- This changes things, don't it?"
- It changes everything.
"Well, lads, you heard the news!"
What happens to us?
"I'll go to the admiral, and I'm sure I can promise you everything you wish."
So long as I leave an orderly ship behind me.
I want all officers set free immediately!
Bring them on deck!
You can't let them go!
You're throwing it all away!
"Jenkins, release the midshipmen!"
- Release the officers.
- Release the officers.
"Please come on deck, sir."
- What happened?
- Mutiny's over.
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.
"Who was it, Ben?"
"It was the, uh... the, uh... concierge at the hotel."
He found out we were being held by the police.
He just called to see if there was anything he could do.
- That's very nice of him.
"- Yes, I thought so."
"I told him if we weren't back there in 15 minutes, for him to call the American Consulate at Casablanca."
"But, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Come on, Jo."
There is just one small formality.
I must request you to sign a statement.
"If it doesn't take too long, of course."
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.
(Hoofbeats)
Ben?
Yeah?
Aren't you going to let me see the message?
I don't - l... I don't think I should.
"Darling, I'm not the police inspector."
I think that I should see it.
"Ben, why didn't you give this to the police?"
- Because I didn't want to.
"- But, Ben, a man's life - ls at stake, yeah l know."
I just - l-l don't know what's the right thing to do.
"We should go back to the hotel, pick up Hank and get out of here."
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.
"What a terrible thing this is for him, seeing a man murdered right before his eyes."
- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.

What can I do?
"When they found you, what the hell did they do?"
My mom shook me like a Polaroid picture.
That's what the hell she did.
"She be like, ""Don't you ever run away from me again."""
I will kill you!
"As long as you stay Black--"""
"I'm like, ""When am I gonna change?"
"What-- What am I--""."
"""As long as you stay Black, don't you ever run away from me again."""
"And then I'd cry so hard,"
I could only get one letter out.
"I be, ""Uh--Uh--Uh--""."
"Eeeeh!"""
You ever seen a little kid get disciplined?
"He be crying, he be, ""Eeeh!"""
"And it's sprinkler cry, ""Tsh-tsh-tsh--eeeeh!"""
"I'm saying, you ain't gotta whip 'em."
You change your personality.
Go Bernie Mac on 'em one damn time and see how they feel.
Just let 'em talk back to you.
"""Shut up, Mom!"""
"""What the fuck did you just say?"
"""And let me tell you something."
"You better sit there and shut what they call the fuck up."""
"""And I'm gonna tell you something."
"""You come over here again, gonna be trouble, trouble."
"""Bust a move!"
Bust a motherfucking move!
"Son of a bitch!"""
"Y'all know the man's eyes was crossed, come on now."
"It's about an authoritative tone, man."
I'm tired of going to the malls and seeing situations with a little kid just running amok.
[laughs]
"Oh, you're so like a man, Townsend."
[chuckles] [sighs] Is it possible that you are the worst friend a fellow has ever had?
[chuckles]
And thank you for picking up my tab tonight.
"Oh, no, thank Winston."
I signed his name to everything.

"So you see, dearest Scott,"
"I worry that I'll never do anything of import, for I'm much too lazy to care whether a thing is done or not."
"All I truly want is to be young always, and to feel that my life is my own."
[indistinct chatter]
Tildy says the people of New York all have different kind of accents.
The likes of which she's never heard.
Plenty of different accents around here.
"You mean, like, Mississippi and Georgia?"
They are different.
Are they not?
"I think Tildy's talkin' about non-southern type accents, Daddy."
"Yes, Tootsie, I understand."

Yet you passed on your chance.

I wouldn't be here.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm good.
"Listen, I hate to ask, but"
I need your help with something.
"Uh, of course."
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.
"Um, are you free for lunch?"
Yeah.
"I have some stuff that I need to do for work, but that sounds great."
"So you guys, I've been thinking about a plan."
"You know, right now this could very well be the first stop on our pancake tour of North America."
"Hey, like in On The Road."
That's my favorite book.
"Mine, too."
So here's the deal.
My mom had this boyfriend.
He hired me to work construction last summer.
But then they broke up...he moved away...to Austin.
In Texas?
"Said if I was ever out there look him up, so..."
"I mean, well, that's really kind of far."
We were thinking like Long Beach or something so we can all still hang out.
I'll need to get a couple of days of work so I can get a little bit of travel money.
"Well, I mean, we can get you money."
"Well, I mean, I guess in a way you're kind of lucky."
"You get to move to a whole new place, start over, be whoever you want to be."
That's really not so bad.

It's way too
They are very cute although they are quite damaged by use the fix it
A turned out really well
I'm just passing this tramp
I estravien the storm
So come in for shelter at home without permission
I offer my apologies
Now I can go ?
Good!
Your minds has also sharpened up along with your body.
"So partner, why did you want to see me?"
I need a house.
Are you looking to buy one?
"No, want to rent one."
So what is the problem?
- Nobody wants to give it to a bachelor.
And I can't call my sister here until I have a house.
Don't worry!
Call your sisters!
How can I call them till I have a house!
Don't worry about that!
I have a lady friend too!
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!
Why?
I am there!
These days even two men can start a family!
"Stay within your limits, Johnny!"
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!
They will help you in your housework too!
How much is the rent?
"3,000 rupees, no security because Johnny has brought you here."
But I will take three months advance.
My tenants will vacate the room in 15 days.
But you need to pay the advance now.
His sisters will be here in 15 days.
He will give you the advance then and you hand us the keys at the same time.
-Why do you ask?
-Mm.
Might she remember?
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
-May I ask...?
-We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
"It's all right, Karl."
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion... point one.
"point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
-The servants?
They have visitors?
-Not at all.
I feel good.
I feel normal.
Okay.
"Stand up, slowly."
Are you ready to play?
Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?
It's part of the estate.
"The gamekeeper's lodge, actually."
"But, yeah, this was the model."
The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.
Wow!
"Very, very cool."
"So what's the game, what do I do?"
You don't have to do anything.
"You just stay in here alone, see how long you last until you're too scared to continue."
"So all I have to do is, like, stay here?"
And I get paid for that?
"I'll be back in the control room, watching."
"There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware."
And now there's this.
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.
Oh!
"Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I will be in contact the whole time."
"Oh, cool."
"And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it?"
"Great, that's great."
"Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you."
"It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game."
"Oh, okay."
"But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time"
- and stop the experiment.
"Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?"
"-BE guy, a real juicer."
-He's in AA now.
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.
They can treat this shit nowadays.

You with the head shrinkers.
This one in rehab now.
I was so upset when he didn't bring me a present back from Italy.
He got something for A.J. and for Meadow.
"He gave me some vinegar, but I don't think it was meant for me."
"It must've meant something, that he felt bad."
"Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old."
I say I'm helping him decorate.
I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.
"If Tony suspects one iota, you know what'll happen to Furio."

-It didn't stop you.
-Steve at the gym?
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.
It took Jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop.
-We haven't slept together yet.
-You're not fucking him?
So this isn't really real.
It is real.
We communicate.
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.
"Just those few minutes when we see each other, I live for those."
I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and I will never be happy.
Be my guest.
"I'm not sure if Kai will let you be his, but you might as well try."
Hold on a second!
Hold on a second!
"Yeah, what?"
It's funny.
I think was expecting someone more...
Charming.
"You know, for a rock star."
May I come in?
Who are you?
"Dr. Tom, Erica's therapist."
Thanks.
"So, what, are you tag-teaming me now?"
Huh?
"So, Dr. Fred sent you in here to talk me back on the straight and narrow, convince me I'm destroying my life?"
Erica ever mention to you that she had a brother?
No.
"Well, he died 10 years ago in a tragic accident, one that Erica tried to go back and prevent by twisting this therapy into something that it's not."
Did it work?
What do you think?
So...
"Well, explain to me, Kai... what is it that you want, exactly?"
To disappear.
Why?
"I mean, what is it that you figure that's gonna do?"
"It's gonna make things better for everybody, including me."
"Well, it seems to me you've tried that already, though,"
Haven't you?
"I mean, you ran away from your whole life."
"And yet, here you are again... running."
"Um, I'm just wondering where it ends."
We thought you'd like to see this.
So many of you have expressed an interest in knowing how I was paid.
Now I can afford to go back to my diet.
Tonight's play is about a body.
Not mine.
"However, the title is"
"""John Brown's Body. """
"In my opinion, John, this is the type of furniture we should be making."
Remarkable.
What is it?
"It's a chair, made out of wrought iron and plastic."
It's the latest modern design.
"And this, Harold?"
That's a copy of a new Swedish reversible sofa.
Hmm.
Does a set of instructions go with them?
I'd be afraid to get into that thing.
"Unfortunately, John, our customers are not quite so old-fashioned."
The public is demanding modern furniture now.
Take this sofa.
"My boy, that is not a sofa."
That is a sofa.
"Constructed, not turned out."
"Quality, my boy."
That's what we're selling.
People are looking for something new.
We've got to give it to them.
Chairs made out of scrap metal?
That's not what our customers expect from John Brown and Company.
We'd get new customers with a line of modern furniture.
"Now, Harold, our sales are fine."
We're making money.
He's like...
"I guess like all treasure hunters, I mean, a little bit on the secretive side, you know."
"Youknow, I don't know how Dan reallyseesFred'spassing."
"But, look, they both persevered intheface of all kinds of adversity."
"Theyrisked,theysweated, they worked, they labored towards the common goal."

- It was my belief that we could.
"- Well, we did."
We did work together.
"Sounds like, to me, that you see it, and I think we all do really, we see Oak Island as a big giant puzzle."
"I know that Fred told me once that that's how he saw it,"
-a big giant puzzle.
-That's why they call it
- the Oak Island mystery.
-Exactly.
"So, you know, we got to get busy and start putting pieces into the right places."
- Amen.
- Amen.
- All right.

"Okay, off we go."
We'll get back to work.
Yeah.
"Hey, remember, you're not going anywhere."
Okay.

"All right, all right."
"I think the important thing to remember is, we've all learned something here today."
Thank you.
We've learned never to let you be in charge of this programme ever again.
That's all we have.
We see you next time.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."

Come inside.
Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
Last number to call the house and last number dialled.
How was she?
What's that mean?
Did she seem suspicious or anything?
?
A bit trusting.
"I wouldn't let anybody into my house, whatever their sob story."
That's cos you're a hardfaced bitch.
Sorry.
While you steal credit cards from lonely and vulnerable women.
Just a moment of madness?
"No, that was just a cheap whore in a bar."
"Well, don't be too hard on yourself."
"It had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
"I'd advise you two to get a room, but it seems you already have."
"Shut up, Calum."
Now sit nice and try not to lick the windows.
Hello?
Is that the Long Bay Hotel?
"Can you put me through to Iain Risdale, please?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
- Thank you.
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.
"Oh, I'd love to see it."
"Oh, it's darling."
I didn't show you my lizard.
I keep him in a box right there.
"I got some holes punched in it, just so he can breathe."
His name is Pocahontas.
"Used to be, a man didn't have to cook his own meals in his own house."
Times have changed.
"Ma's working, and I'm late for church."
"The way you parade yourself up and down, taking off your clothes..."
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!
"Just because we don't live in a palace, doesn't mean we have to act like pigs."
"- We've got a trash can, remember?"
"- Well, well, well."
"If you don't pick it up, somebody else has to."
And it wouldn't harm you to take the garbage out and bury it.
Or do you like living like a pig?
"What do you think you are, always giving orders?"
Take your hands off of me!
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!
Just a little family fracas.
Guess my little girl's getting too big to spank.
"It was my fault, Allison."
I made him mad.
Every family has fights.
That's a lot.
I sort of flew off the handle when you said what you did.
I'm sorry.
I don't blame you.
Nick.
Jim's going to ask me to marry him tonight.
What can i say to him?
You know what to say.
"Well, i can't marry him."
L- i don't love him.
You know that.
"I can't help you, josie."
You've known this was coming for a long time.
You've taken everything he's offered you.
Now you've got to pay for it.
But not with love.
"Jim loves you, josie... and i don't."
"If you don't go through with it, everything i ever said about you is true."
"You know, i never asked you... if you'd let me give you a ring for that finger."
Will you put it on?
Nick.
"I had to see you, josie."
"Josie, you did the right thing tonight."
I've been walking the streets for hours telling myself that.
And i want you to know i lied to you.
About you and me?
I knew it.
"Once, i thought that a star on a dressing room door would be worth any sacrifice."
"But the one sacrifice i never figured on... i'm going to make that, nick."
"I'm glad you feel that way about it, josie."
She is so beautiful so lovely all is vanity and vanity will make you blind
do you hear that?
"Have a seat, Mrs erm?"
- Er...
Compton!
- We'll see what we can do for you.
Maybe we could set up a trust fund so they're provided for.
- What?
- A trust fund.
So that they are provided for.
Of course they are!
"Every morning, regular."
Minnie has her milk warmed but Sandrine doesn't.
Fresh from the fridge or she turns her nose up at it.
"The boys have their Crackles in the morning and the ladies in the afternoon, and that is important, and you should write this down, young man."
Use your mouse.
"Mrs Compton, I understand."
Leave it with me.
(Knocks on door)
Hi.
"Tell me something, Peter, when did this Mary Goodyear die, exactly?"
- Three weeks ago.
- The same time Barkway invited you to speak at his conference.
"Thank you, and good morning."
And welcome all to our conference on human justice.
Bunking off class?
That isn't like you.
- Going to a rave or something?
"- No, the library."
"- Miss Cramer, please..."
- Let me get this straight.
Barkway has seen that intimidating me personally doesn't work.
So now he's sent his poodle to do the job instead.
"Really, Miss Cramer, I am nobody's poodle."
Don't eat the pie.
You'll never leave.
Where is he?
"Oh, His Royal Highness?"
I believe he's holding court over there.
Eric.
Dad!
Hey!
"Dad, these are the guys, and this is Irene."
Hi.
"Nice to meet you, Irene."
Guys.
"Uh, Eric, your mother and I decided that you were responsible enough to take your brother on the road for two months."
"Now, is this the way you thank us?"
I was going to call you in the morning and let you know my plans.
I'll tell you your plans.
You're going to get in your car and follow me home without stopping anywhere.
Now.
Come on.
"Um, actually, I'd rather stay here with Irene and the guys."
Maybe we better do this in private.
"So, there's a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in this town?"
"Well, I could use a nurse."
"Now, why don't you tell me what this is really about?"
I don't think you'd understand.
Try me.
I don't see the point in going back home.
Why not?
"Because there's nothing there for me, Dad."
"I mean, I went to nursery school, grammar school, high school, for what?"
"I mean, I didn't get into college."
"Everything I've done up until now has been a waste, and it's just too late to change who I am."
"- Oh, return address."
Exactly why did you take this?
Habit.
Just habit.
"You stuck your hand in the wrong cookie jar, little girl."
The price of being with my husband will be insanity and death.
I hope it was worth it.
Bad Fae.
Stupid girl.
Someone should have told you never to cross a Fury.
Get out of my head.
This is nothing.
I'm gonna sear your mind beyond repair.
Let's turn up the heat.
- Let's go.
- My bag.
"Call the grease monkeys, man."
I can smell brain oil burning down the hall.
"Tong says break some cases, I'll break some cases."
Yeah.
You know the surefire way to convince a therapist that you need help?
No?
Show up to your first appointment late.
Therapy is bullshit.
Human bullshit.
"If you don't play ball, you're gonna end up one castrated cop which means you're useless to our side."
Go to your session.
How's the head?
Achy.
I don't really remember what happened.
Can you just put that down?
"- And where did you get that, anyway?"
"Police are questioning the victims' acquaintances, and are expanding their investigation."
"Jung Ki-ho, reporting from Nam Mountain."
Sure you didn't do it?
I didn't.
- Then who?
- I don't know.
Are you sure?
"- You did it, didn't you?"
- Don't!
Why would I kill them?
I asked if you took my cellphone.
We will see a lunar eclipse within the next weeks.
The weather bureau reported that this will be the biggest...
This is my food.
Where have you been?
You scared me.
Have something on your mind lately?
I understand that kids your age want to hold on to a secret.
"Your father understands, okay?"
Thanks.
All I want to give you is one advice.
"Whatever you've eaten until now, whether it be raw or boiled, if you want to eat something from now on, you can't lick your chops, I mean, you can't eat it."
- Understand?
- Don't wake me up.
Can you breathe in there?
Where can I hide it this time?
You've worked too hard.
Who's there?
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
"I knew it was your birthday, so I wanted to surprise you."
Was it too surprising?
Someone in there might be trying to get out.
Thas a big assumption.
"Even if our people didn't cause the problem, you know they'd take advantage of it."
This is our best chance to find them.
"In about 30 seconds, the Mokra are going to open fire."
I don't know how long we'll be able to wait for you.
Understood.
Darod.
I'm looking for my people.
Back this way.
I'll show you.
Don't move.
There you are.
What are you doing here?
I would do everything in my power to protect my only child.
There's a phased- ion charge coming at us from the planet.
Full power to the shields.
Shields at 60 percent.
Minor damage on Deck 14.
They're firing again.
Modulate the shield frequencies.
Try to throw off their sensors.
No effect.
Direct hit to the port nacelle.
Redirect all warp power to the shields.
Two more coming in.
Captain.
We've got to get you back to the ship.
You're hurt.
"Ralkana, the other cells are this way."
We must find your mother.
Follow this passageway until it dead- ends.
The only thing shot was a bottle of soda.
I don't even know if you should go there alone anymore.
Maybe we should drop you off every morning.
Dad !
The gun was in the school.
We can't be with her all day.
We are not going to change our entire lives over this.
There was one stupid gun shot.
You are not dropping me at school.
God. I'm not an eight years old.
At my school this kid slipped on this wet spot.
And fell.
Like on his face.
Maybe we should take her out of school.
- Honey.
- Put her in private school.
- l wish we could afford that.
- Maybe that's not an excuse.
Maybe we should sacrifice other things.
Like the house in Palm Beach?
This is our daughter we are talking about.
I know.
"Listen, I don't know why the world's gone so crazy..."
and I don't know what to do about it.
I wish we could keep them...
in some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
I'm not asking for a bubble.
"How about just a place where they can live, and walk to school..."
and become grownups without having to worry about...
guns and Al D S and serial murderers.
That didn't use to be exotic.
That wasn't the province of the rich.
Suddenly there's a hole in the wall.
Money vanished silently.
He's no ordinary thief.
You don't say anything.
I got the stick of my life for trusting you.
We all had our balls busted.
I'll get the details...
You can't do it.
We've handed over the case to a new officer.
Call the new officer.
I told you that you can never catch me after December 16th.
"Today I'm reporting for duty, I think all are waiting for me."
"I wanted to do it for children, I did it."
It's over.
"Then, what about this?"
This is for my lover.
She wants me to be a police officer.
I worked hard to become a police officer.
But there's a real kick in fulfilling her wish.
Shattering!
What are you discussing?
Give the file to him.
Who do you think he's?
"Meritorious candidate, and he gave a lot on information about the thief also."
Don't you feel you've caught the thief by looking at him?
Yes sir.
"You don't feel bad, old officer."
Nothing like that sir.
I know very well about him.
He's very sincere.
Handover all your wealth to him.
He's the right man for you.
I'm out of it.
- I can get us past the lock.
- So can I.
After me.
Whoa!
- Bluestone!
- Help!
(crash)
(groans)
Now that's what I call an entrance.
Who's there?
What is this?
I want answers!
"So do we, gargoyle."
So do we.
(banging)
- Why didn't you use the key I gave you?
- I lost it on the way down!
Why didn't you warn me about that blasted chute?
Any advance hesitation on your part might have made the gargoyle suspicious.
But you played your part well.
Now the fun begins.
(Malone) Welcome to the Hotel Cabal.
(Matt) That brings us to where we left off.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm sure you've noticed by now this is no ordinary hotel.
The Cabal is designed to decimate one's grip on reality.
"Once your defenses are down, we step in and strip your mind of its most precious memories and darkest secrets."
"By the time a guest leaves here, he's little more than a mindless cretin."
Funny how the least little thing sets him off.
I know what you're thinking - open window.
Too good to be true.
"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."
"OK, so what's the population, hmm?"
"12,000, 15,000?"
"OK, so what's the population, hmm?"
"12,000, 15,000?"
'Course they know each other.
'Course they know each other.
What's the first thing a good copper does
"What's the first thing a good copper does when he moves to a new town, Warwick?"
"when he moves to a new town, Warwick?"
Shakes everybody's hand.
Shakes everybody's hand.
"But this is Griffith, Phil."
Bloody heartland of the cannabis industry.
"But this is Griffith, Phil."
Bloody heartland of the cannabis industry.
"Coppers take money to look the other way, you know that."
"Coppers take money to look the other way, you know that."
So what are you saying?
Malcolm's involved in Mackay's disappearance?
So what are you saying?
Malcolm's involved in Mackay's disappearance?
Or murder.
Maybe.
Or murder.
Maybe.
"I don't know, but I know I don't bloody trust him."
"I don't know, but I know I don't bloody trust him."
Who was it that pointed us to Trimbole?
Who was it that pointed us to Trimbole?
"Well, since he's Trimbole's alibi,"
"Well, since he's Trimbole's alibi, maybe he thought it was worth the risk."
Shock pulses set!
Shooting now.
It's no good!
There's no response.
Raise the voltage.
But that would endanger the lives of the pilots!
N-No...!
Double...
Burning...
Crash...!
"So, it was the pulse that Romlin sent out that awakened them?"
All data concerning the stimulus points for arousing the pilots have been inputted into me.
Then why didn't you awaken Kuya?
"Well, uh..."
"Oh, Hitomi..."
Job well done...
"Well, I guess it's thanks to you we were able to win today."
I'll let you off the hook today.
Thank you.
Did you really think you could go scot-free?
!
No!
That's unfair!
Can this be allowed to happen?
You know...
Dr. Kazamaki and the Vice-Commander say they know nothing about you.
Uh-oh...!
"You tampered with the call when I made the check, didn't you?"
Uh... er... tampered...?
Isn't it time we all went home...?
I heard they were planning something like that.
"But when the prototype was made, too many problems cropped up, so the project was halted."
Not anymore.
What do you mean?
"- Well, neither of us has a husband now."
- Wh-What did you say?
"Well, Danny, about ten minutes before I left to come down here, my husband called, and he wants a divorce."
"Aw, come..."
Come on.
You don't have to worry about that.
"I mean, that's just talk."
It's not gonna happen.
[Louise] You're right.
"It's not going to happen, without one hell of a fight."
"Why isn't it gonna happen, Danny?"
"- Hey, come on."
We're talking.
"- Eh, what am I supposed to do, dig a hole?"
[Laughs] He got you there.
"They said that I should talk, you know, to give an expression to myself."
"Okay, maybe I'm a little bit pushy."
But I can't keep talking if he's gonna keep shutting' me up!
"Doctor, l-I don't even want this guy in here."
"I mean, after all, we had the perfect family without him."
"""We had a family."" Tell me about it."
No.
The family and the group are the same.
"Now, when I lost my son three months ago, these people were wonderful."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that, Mr. Seymour."
"We've already been through that, Mr. Theodopilus."
Don't take us backwards.
"Besides, it's... it's all right about your family now, isn't it?"
"No, it's not all right!"
It'll never be all right.
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
No.
I am crazy.
Alexander Leek.
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein.
I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.
Where are they seeing it?
"Point Pleasant, West Virginia."
You can help me.
Follow me.
The nocturnal butterfly.
"In ancient cultures, the moth represents a form of the psyche... or the soul immortally trapped... in the hellish death realms."
Mothman.
That's what the Ukranians called him.
"Rough translation, of course."
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl the year the nuclear plantwent down.
"Galveston, 1969, just before the hurricane."
They saw it.
But seeing isn't always believing.
"Look, there's never been a single shred of evidence... to show that these things exist materially."
So you're telling me these things do not exist?
"Oh, they exist."
All kinds of things exist around us that we never see.
"Electricity, microwaves, infrared waves."
"You know, these things have been around forever."
"- Uh, yeah."
We got rid of that.
Okay?
- Yeah.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the ""I got caught cheating"" diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
- It's a family heirloom.
- Yeah.
I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half sister over Christmas.
So I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully that she can suck it.
Okay.
I gotta bounce.
- Stop saying that.
- This deejay from Dubai... is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
I was still young.
And I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me...
- would be a total...
- Disaster.
"I mean, she's like an entirely different species."
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
Wow.
She was a blackmailer.
And I killed her.
"And up to now, I'm glad I killed her."
And I believe that in this killing the murderer has the sympathetic part.
Does that satisfy you?
"Yes, sir."
That satisfies me.
"Lieutenant, you would do me an enormous favor if you stopped calling me sir."
Are you tired of living?
Yes?
What do you want?
Who is it?
Let me look at it
Don't you recognize me?
I am Man Si Sun
You sent me your photo and I sent you mine
Look at it I know you
"I know you're coming today, Uncle Chow called earlier"
"You've got guts, it's different here now"
The law has been changed
Both you and I will be in trouble if someone sees you
"Besides, Hong Kong is not as good as they say"
You'd better go
Mrs. Lee
Good morning

No...she's got the wrong place I won't be bothering you
Let's do it this way I've got a hundred dollars here
"What you did was righteous, but the magistrate will disagree."
Stay away from Ahsan for a while.
But...
"Wherever you go, whatever you do, don't lose the spirit and courage you showed today."
"And someday, you will restore your grandfather's good name and revive this clan."
You will be able to change the world as you so desire.

Heaven has made him with a purpose I'm sure...
"Forgive me, sir..."
Yi Soon-shin?
That bastard is out to destroy me!
"Yi Soon-shin, that bastard!"
Soon-shin!
Chun-su!
Where are you going alone?
"You're not running away without me, are you?"
Chun-su...
I'm coming with you.
I'm sick of this place.
What am I going to do here in Ahsan without you and without my father?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
Let's stop and rest for a while?
"No, we have to be out of Chun-an before dawn."
But I can't take another step!
We have to go.
I can't!
Let me get a drink of water at least.
"Chun-su, let's get going!"
Hold your horses?
"The catatrophe could only be avoided using the mathematical system of Adam Bernau, a 20th century scientist."
Academician Filip is entrusted with the leadership of Expedition Adam 84.
"The technology of the age is so advanced, even travel into the past is possible."
"The members of the expedition are getting to know the century of two world wars, natural catastrophes, and social inequalities, and unexpectedly start to oppose Filip."
They consider their trip to 1984 too dangerous.
3.
THE VISITORS ARRIVE
"Yes, because they wanted to fly."
And not because the computer liked them.
Hallo!
Where are you?
Good morning!
Morning exercise!
- What a hairstyle!
- Come on!
Can we start now?
He looks terrible.
Who's going to tell him?
Will you?
No turning back now.
- Is the fire prepared?
- No.
It should be burning by now!
This man's blind.
He seems not to notice that we don't care about his Expedition.
A piece of crap!
He's gone crazy!
He'll burn down the house!
Filip!
Where are you?
Filip!
He isn't upstairs!
He gave to the cops?
He would not!
"He was on their side, get it?"
Why would he do that?
Ask your sister.
-Relax.
Nobody knows anything.
What happened with Siri?
Nothing.
-They Paid for the funeral.
I think they're angry now.
The club has a code of honor when it comes to girls.
"If Siri does not know anything, she's safe."
The police would take Christer Johansson's death at some point?
-I Do not know.
-You Can tell us about the circumstances?
The police would not comment on the report in VG today.
We comment on the technical findings?
No.
-You Can come here after?
-Of Course.
With thousand of these newspapers he will buy a new iPhone.
Good morning to everyone!
"It will be a tough day, but we will do better."
The moderation of the OS is not something to which we are accustomed.
But there is something interesting in the Oslo police files.
"A car seized a girl who can be Zana, highway E6 in Mastemyr."
"Get nothing else from her, and she looked troubled, then they took her to the psychiatric hospital."
She's there?
"-negative, She ran away."
"They warned the police, but no one found it."
Find out if it was Zana.
See you later.
[phone rings]
All right.
So?
How'd you get on?
"What, totally empty?"
I tried.
I'll drive myself.
I've got a nice new car there.
See you in a bit.
"Make it look good, eh?"
"I already have, Jimmy."
I already have.

I think this is proof that We need to keep going back.
Captain kris kelly Finally notches a success.
Let's get the boat Ready.
And things are looking up For the kellys.
We're gonna make 100 ounces In the river this season.
Everybody's on my team now.
We're gonna go back there And kill it.
I packed the trailer.
So we can get the quad In the back-up.
- My god.
- -what the
I got too many bills to pay.
You can't do this.
You said you'd use it Before for one day.
I got to work.
"I got to make a living, too."
I need it back down there.
"Gearing up this morning,"
"Getting ready to hit The river again,"
And what happens?
My dad's friend comes along.
That he's borrowing The boat from.
So now I'm back at square one.
I don't have a boat To go river mining with.
I've got a claim that we know There's gold at.
And we just can't get it again.
"Okay, we'll meet You down there."
We'll put it Back in there.
I don't want to go down a bad Road with you guys.
"Don't worry, We'll bring it right back."
Without a dredge Built Specifically for river Mining...
What do you know about a drug called Knipex?
Knipex.
"Ah, it's a dopamine agonist used to treat neurological disorders."
"Stops tremors, that sort of thing."
Wow.
Even I feel bad trying to win a bet against a guy who's sick.
But not that bad.
All right.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Hi, honey."
[Sighs]
I knew I'd find you here.
But you left so quickly last night.
"Well, I was trying to call that health inspector."
Do you know how much money we're losing every day we're closed?
"Well, listen, overseeing Wolfgang Puck's new place, plus Opus,"
"Mystique, all the beverage and food operations..."
"You know, maybe it's just, you know, a little too much."
Is that it?
What?
It's overwhelming.
You're letting things slide.
Slide?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
That stuff happens.
Happens all the time.
"But the question is, how... how can we fix this?"
I cannot believe you have so little faith in me.
That inspector's just trying to get revenge on me for refusing to go out on a date with him.
"Come on, honey."
That report's a fake.
He made it all up.
"Michelangelo, can I?"
Can I ask you something?
"Do you think that something is, like, there, whether you look at it or not?"
"And... and do you think everything or every, every, every, every, everybody exists that ever was or ever will be?"
"Because, then, logically you don't have to do anything at all."
You can just sit and wait and wait for it all to happen but...
"But I don't want to wait, you know?"
Cos what if that's not true?
"I mean, free will must have something to do with it, otherwise what's the point of being alive?"
Have you got?
Have you got?
"Have you got, like, some place I could stay?"
I mean...
"I mean, would your mum?"
"Would your mum mind, if I?"
I...
I just really want to get away from... from all this.
"You know, like doing, like..."
like doing the show.
Doing the show again and...
And I thought...
And I...
But Rho...
"I mean, Rho..."

But I...
I thought...
I thought... maybe...
W... what... what do you think?
Michelangelo I would like you to record something for posterity.
And you keep it safe.
You understand?
"Hi, honey."
Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?
This is the same fight as breakfast.
It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.
"That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with."
"Hal,"
I'm not about to lose it with a...
"God, how does he do that?"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Please, we have to stop."
I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.
One last time.
"One, two, three, go!"
This is gonna be so great!
This is the answer.
What's the question?
"I don't know yet, but this is definitely the answer."
Would you look at this?
Jamie poured flour in the dryer.
Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.
He destroys everything!
He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!
"Oh, you say that with every kid."
"Let's face it, Lois."
It's just the hand we were dealt.
God just doesn't like us.
That doesn't make us bad people.
"No, there's something different with Jamie."
He's not like the other ones.
"I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes."
"Honey, calm down."
You know what will make you feel better?
Luxury liners have long had a tendency to sink...
"So that's how it all ended, but it seems that old witch was a spy for some country that dealt in slave trade."
And who were those men chasing after me?
Secret police...?
!
You should have told me!
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
"Someone else forgot his cell phone before, remember?"
I see...
"Because of you, I had to be tailed by these blokes."
These blokes...?
I'll forgive you this time.
It was sorta fun.
So long...
Be sure to tune in next time!
"Hi, I'm the quick-change artist, Hitomi Chidou."
"In the next episode, you'll meet a dirty robot who claims to be a support robot."
"Saying he's under orders from Headquarters, he makes us do things like take off our clothes!"
"Plus, we face an enemy who comes from outer space... and he's god-awful strong!"
"Tune in for ""Shooting Star from the Sky"""
on the next Great Dangaioh.
"Oh, I'm so mad!"
What awful weather...
"Send that file to Saga of the Stats Division, first."
Yes.
You'll get the details when the Commander returns.
Huh...?
Kuya...
Ohh...
I...
Who is it?
!
"- Oh, god."
More protestors?
Guess some folks from the church must've gotten wind of the festivities.
I'm still so shocked that that kind of anti-semitism exists down here.
"Yes, well, it may not be just the Jewish thing."
"Yeah, but still, they're just backwards, pigheaded philistines."
Some people have taken issue with our age difference.
"Well, she could be younger."
"I mean, hey."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, legally, I suppose she could, but I couldn't very well push her down the aisle in a stroller."
[Laughs loudly]
"Still, even my late wife... she came to me in a dream last night,"
"- told me, ""it ain't right."""
- Listen to me.
Your dead ghost wife is wrong.
If you've been lucky enough to find love...
I have.
"You have, so nothing should stop you from grabbing onto it and holding onto it forever."
- [Chuckles] Oh!
- Uh-oh.
They're unloading the hate bus.
Protestors: [Chanting] Not in our town!
Not in our town!
The racists down here are really organized.
"This makes me really, really angry."
They're gonna ruin everything.
"Nate, go get rid of them."
"No, no, no."
Deep breath.
Just ignore them.
I've learned to rise above the bigotry.
"Well, guess what, pal?"
What's the deputy head like?
"Teaches natural history, very good teacher."
He kicked up a bit of a fuss and then said:
Can't you hold on for the last few days?
Do you like any of the girls in the class?
I've only been in this class for a year.
- Only a year?
- l was in another class.
And in that class?
Do you like going to the cinema?
Not really.
"They're showing the BlackTulip, everyone's been... lt's excellent."
Aren't you going to see it?
I don't know.
Would you like to go?
"Well, I... I'd like to."
Today it's on at half past three.
"Calmly, that's the Reverie."
That's a strange Reverie.
Will you ask your parents or shall we go without permission?
I can say I'm going to the cinema.
They'll let me go.
Won't they object to you going with a girl?
"I'll say we're going with the class, after all, we do that."
So we'll meet and go.
Where shall we meet?
I don't know.
That'll do...
That's the Reverie.
Won't it be awkward if we go to the cinema?
Won't some girl be jealous?
It'd be my first time like that.
"I thought I had lost him, but maybe Malvado can sense me getting closer."
"Wait, he can sense you?"
"He's a Lord, Richard."
He made me.
"So he can get inside your head, like you do to me?"
Worse.
"Well, can he sense other culebras?"
- Can he sense me?
- I don't know.
"I thought I knew what Malvado could do, but I guess I'm not so sure."
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to find out."
[Malvado] Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"After all these years, only la diosa could come between you."
- [speaks Spanish]
- I don't speak Spanish.
"She's the sweetest kind of poison, the kind you crave."
She's the reason that my uncle is dead.
"True, and yet you, me,"
"Carlos, Richard, we're all fools for her."
No.
"I may be a selfish, backstabbing piece of shit, but I don't dig on your snake princess."
"I do, however, recognize her value."
I want ten million cash and a guarantee that you and your culebra cronies will never bother me or my girl ever again.
How do I know you even have her?
Figured you'd ask. [Whistles]
Give it to me.
[inhales deeply]
Your brother must be furious.
"Oh, I wouldn't worry about him."
He's just whipped.
Don't I know you somehow?
Trevor Nigel.
And you must be Richard Castle.
- Yes.
- We've only ever talked on the phone.
Yeah.
Nice to finally put a face to all those notes.
Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.
Are you kidding me?
This is fate.
"I'm serious, Rick."
Your name literally just came up in our last story-development meeting.
It did?
"Now, look, I know this studio did a poor job producing Heatwave, but believe me, I fought for your vision."
"And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business."
"Oh, uh, well, thank you."
I'm flattered.
[Cellphone chiming] But we're not actually here about my books.
We're actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.
"Yes, I heard about that."
It was shocking.
Phil was a great guy.
He saved my ass a couple of years ago.
Got photos of my ex having an affair with our personal psychic.
- Oh.
- Saved me millions.
"[Chiming continues] So, Phillip's sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio."
Yes.
Phil said he was working a new case.
He asked for a favor.
"I owed him one, so I said okay."
Who was he investigating?
He wanted access to Austin Elektra.
I'm calling the diner for help.
Han...
"Caroline, we don't have a good connection, and not just because we're dueling Scorpios."
Peek-a-boo!
I see you!
Oleg.
"All right, now do it with Barbara."
"Han, we had all of our belongings thrown out of a private plane."
"Caroline, you're cutting out."
"All I heard was ""private plane."" Brag much?"
"No, we need to get to Texas, so can you please put $500 in my PayPal account?"
What?
You have $500?
Did I call you to gloat when I bought this snazzy new vest?
I'm putting you on speaker.
Private plane...
Have... credit card...
We lost her.
Or maybe her butler snatched her phone from her.
"Oh, God."
He hung up.
"Max, can we just go back to that terrible place we call home?"
That mountain lion is wearing my new blouse.
And here she comes!
Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.
I'm calling the credit card company to send us new cards.
They're used to hearing me cry.
"So is the unfortunate family that sat behind us at ""Zootopia."""
"If animals can all get along, so can we."
"Look, once we get our cards, we'll be on our way to Randy in Texas... and what was in this for me again?"
5 1/2 near-death experiences?
"Hi, Visa."
My mother would kill me.
"What is that, a Danish?"
This is the one.
Right here.
Trees are fascinating.
They don't have to touch to propagate.
You would find that fascinating.
- How many do I need?
"- One, two, three, four..."
Why didn't I see that?
Thank you very much.
I owe you one.
Sometimes you don't see what's right in front of your face.
Six and a five.
I got you.
The pretzel!
You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.
I'm going to take my theory of love as a man-made cultural creation and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual.
Greg.
You need a hobby.
"I can't believe you've dated for three months, and you haven't kissed!"
- How do you say hello?
"- Well, we nod."
It works.
You mean you haven't even touched?
"I fell down once, and he picked me up."
- We talk a lot.
That's what we do.
- About what?
"And I don't worry about what I say, what I wear, what I eat..."
It's a relief to eat with a man and not worry that he'll be frightened.
Where is Bathroom?
"Bathroom is on left, Whose left?"
Yours or mine?
"Your Tamil will take my life, And I am M.A. Munay."
"Murli Manohar Monday, not enough, not less, bubble gum."
"You told me to come and get the money at 12:00, so it's 12:00,"
"Jia Jee, today I am in serious mode, so cut the crap, bubble gum."
"Please have it, Please!"
Look!
I am not feeling very well and my head is so hot.
Then make your head cool and take coconut.
"Then sit under the coconut tree,"
"Not coconut, why you're saying coconut?"
"You gave my money or I'll take it, Sorry!"
May I have water?
"Jia Jee, someone fire a bullet."
It's not like that you call some guys here to kill me.
"There are nobody, Jiaa, M.M. Munday not enough, not less."
Bubble Gum.
Very much.
"But Munday won't afraid to any bad guy, you just wait here I'll be back."
What the hell?
Where is this Laxminarayan?
It isn't like this that he's here and he's not recognizing you.
Yes.
"It could be,"
"Eat sometime, Excuse me, I need to announce my name"
Laxminarayan!
"Sir, I didn't came here to kill you."
I didn't came here to kill you.
"Sir, trust me, I didn't came to kill."
Then whom you came to kill?
"I, uh..."
"Well, no man ever died more convenient to a grave."
You're sure that we're doing the right thing?
I think it's best.
Best for you.
I guess so.

[Man] And so that is just like I told you.
[laughter]
"All right, all right!"
Now listen some more!
Already it is 30 years since I came here from Copenhagen to start my shop.
I do not marry.
I put my heart in my hands and shape the wood.
"People like, and I make the shop bigger and bigger, and I put more and more men to work."
"Good men, all of you."
The best.
"Old friends, I know what is in your heads."
You want to know why I stop you from work to talk to you like this.
"I think everybody that knows Axel Norstaad knows my dream that someday, here in our little Danish part of the Valley, we have our own Children's Hospital."
"And now, at last,"
I find a way to make this dream to be fulfilled.
And I just couldn't handle it going down like that again.
You really like me?
I'm crazy about you.
"Well, I like hearing that... because I love you."
What?
But we never even...
You know.
"But we've talked on the phone every night for, like, a month, and I love talking to you."
I love hearing what you have to say about everything.
And I don't want to rush the other stuff if it means you're gonna freak out.
Because I want this to be something.
"So I'm fine with waiting, okay?"
"Just, no more chili cheese fries."
- They smell disgusting.
- Deal.
They say that the hallmark of a good negotiation is when neither side is particularly happy.
"Well, then this was a very good negotiation."
My people will hate this deal.
Yep.
"Mine, too."
"You didn't need to pull that whole ""helpless"" act on me, you know?"
"Sure, you say that now."
Seriously.
"I mean, you're a killer negotiator."
You don't need tricks.
You've got skills.
Hmm.
You're not too bad yourself.
"Oh, a word of advice, though..."
- I'd keep an eye on that daughter of yours.
- Are you kidding?
I've completely given up on that one.
No.
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
"Okay, listen to me."
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
I am not trying to get her back.
"But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
"All right, honey, let me tell you a story."
"There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt."
"Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it."
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I believe I do.
Mm.
I'm the guy.
You're not the guy.
Are you sure?
That would explain so much.
"Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me"
"""sweetie"" all the time."
"I call everyone ""sweetie."""
You tramp.
(sighs)
"Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
"""Strap on a pair""?"
"Of what, skates?"
"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
"(quiet, dramatic musical score playing in movie)"
"If you're bored, you can go."
I understand.
"No, I'm having a nice time."

Don't patronize me.
"... havethemon theirknees,beggingme to make the keynote speech."
And then?
A short sojourn to Albany...
... followedbyalongone at the White House.
"If I didn't know better, I'd be bursting with admiration."
I thought I'd come in and find you on your knees.
"Instead, you're turning adversity into triumph."
That's just a reflex.
An old habit of mine.
But it's still good to hear you say it.
The way you say it too.
"""""Adversity into triumph. """""
It's good to know you still believe in me.
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I thought you did.
Don't fathers listen to their sons?
How is your father these days?
I haven't heard you mention him for a while.
Where is he?
"In a nursing home in Crowley, Louisiana."
Plays dominoes with orderlies.
Fulminates over his Cream of Wheat.
Don't be too hard on him.
We can't dictate our finishes.
I don't like the sound of that.
Of course you don't.
Because underneath all that need to believe...
... underalltheconcrete you poured into my pedestal...
... somethingiscryingtogetout.
What?
You know I called Judge Walter Stern.
"You got 80% of the company in bed with the Navy, and..."
"And what, Ron?"
We need that military contract.
Not gonna happen.
Navy wants to go light.
"Steel is out, poly fiber is in."
"Dalton, did the contract expire, or did it expire?"
Expired.
And are we gonna get it back?
Don't see it happening.
"Legal doesn't see it happening, Ron."
Maybe we should stop yapping about a Navy contract we don't have anymore and figure out how (slams hand on table) to sell some damn steel!
I have to go.
Give our best to the Secretary of the Navy.
And good luck with the speech.
"As President and CEO of Wickes Steel  Shipbuilding,"
I'm proud of the work my family has put into building these great machines.
They're an unshakable foundation upon which the Navy can take her fleet to new heights.
How was that?
MAN:
"That was perfect, sir."
Thank you.
WICKES:
Was I loud enough?
JARVIS:
Always are.
(laughs)
"Mr. Secretary, I..."
I feel sorry for you having to follow that.
"Oh, I was going to have you take a look at my speech, maybe do a little punch up."
WICKES (chuckles):
"Like old times, huh?"
"Vasundhara, who has been charged with financial forgery is being investigated by the police."
We chased Vasundhara for many days regarding this case.
We are collecting the details of the money lost by the victims.
What a man!
Thank you very much.
Your news has taken over every news channel.
You are the pride of our district!
Thank you.
"- Congrats, constable sir."
"Thank you, Sir."
"Super, dude!"
One cop like you in a town is enough to stop fraudsters.
Thank you.
- You are great!
Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?
You have achieved a great thing.
You've got all the accolades that I should have for my service for 37 years of service today!
Sir...
I just did my job.
People giving the praise...
The photos of the victims have been recovered from Vasundhara's phone.
Is that you?
That is definitely you!
Why would you take a picture that close to her!
Dear...
She is already jailed.
Your anger still not subsided?
!
"Varun, I'm coming for you."
- What's cooking?
- My mother's recipe...
- Dad hated jelly beans.
- He liked the cherry ones.
- He said they taste like cough syrup.
The only candy your father really liked is Almond Joy.
Don't ask me why.
"But get what you want, get what you want."
Not if Dad hated them.
Yael.
What was Dad like before he met Mom?
"He didn't smell as good, but he was the golden boy to my black sheep."
"He did everything right, a mother's dream."
"Hardworking, athletic, ambitious."
"That wasn't getting him laid, so he went through a tortured-artist phase."
- Where are his paintings?
"- No, no, no, not that kind of artist."
A performance artist.
He did weird stuff like paint his whole body silver and stand naked on the war memorial reciting bad poetry.
- Why?
- To get laid.
"It worked, too."
He met your mom when he hired her to dance barefoot in his Feet Me in St. Louis installation.
But he was always broke.
"It wasn't really his true nature, and your mom wanted kids."
"So he took his engineering degree, got a real job, moved to suburbia."
I'm never getting married.
It's death.
You're a little young to have reached that conclusion.
"How come you're not married, Uncle Andy?"
'Cause it's death.
Right here.
Here we go.
So Elaine Roberts' brother owns Green Grass Landscaping?
"I'll keep my eyes closed, I promise."
"He's such a good man, isn't he?"
'I wanted to get Lena's things quickly and get back to the house.
"'I don't know what it was - a feeling, I guess - 'but I was bothered by something."
'Maybe I just didn't trust Higgins with her.
"'Anyway, I'd feel better the sooner I got back to the estate."
"'What I really didn't like was invading the privacy of their home, 'especially since I knew what they'd experienced in the past."
"'I felt strange going through Lena's things, which was silly."
'I'd seen this kind of stuff before.
"'Well, most of it, anyhow."
"'If I couldn't take Saul back to her, 'l could at least take back a pleasant memory.'"

This was taken in Suez with my messmates.
"That was in 1946, right after the war."
Karl.
It's dark.
She must be in the main house.
With how many others?
I only have four shots.
Don't worry.
That'll be enough.
"The pictures are wonderful, Higgins."
But I have such a headache.
Do you mind?
"Oh, how inconsiderate of me."
You must be exhausted.
Can I get you anything?
An aspirin?
Some chicken soup?
You're so kind.
Thank you.
Just a little rest.
"Boss, I'm sorry, I..."

What happened to you?
I fell from the stairs
"My son's gone, my baby is gone!"
Lost...
"Ah Kwai, help me"
My son's gone...
"You only think about your son, and not about me"
"That's not true, but I've spent so much money in the hope that I could have a son"
A son...
You should have the ability
Am I not?
I'll give you anything you want
Did you say I'm not capable?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
"You bastard lf you are that capable, marry a Miss Hong Kong"

"My friend worked in Jamie's Italian in Dublin, and you're given a list of words that you're supposed to say."
Them's proper posh chips.
"But, uh, he was selling a pizza to someone, and you were told to say, ""Do you want me to pimp that for you?"""
Ohh.
"And it was like an old lady who was like,"
"""Hire it out for sex work?"""
That is so Jamie.
"What do you think, do you like him, Ellie?"
I do quite like him.
"It's nice to have someone, cos I'm from Essex, someone else from Essex who isn't just famous for being, like,"
"""Oh, you're mugging me off!"" So that's quite nice."
"He's got a trade, and I like that about him."
I'm from Essex as well.
Are you?
"Yeah, if that helps at all."
You're really ruining the image.
There was literally like a gasp from the audience.
Whereabouts are you from?
Billericay.
Shut the front door!
"No, where are you from?"
Brentwood!
No!
"Oh, my God!"
That means we're going to have to fight.
"I was worried where that was going to go there, Richard."
"To be fair, the size of her, I reckon you could reach from there!"
DAVID:
"My, um..."
Wow!
There's a good chance they're talking about fighting.
Maybe they're talking about fighting.
And here we go.
We loosen our arms And up and down and up and...
Sir.
Excuse me.
"Import, export."
Let's go.
Mr. Vanyerka?
-Doctor Yansky?
-Yes.
What would you like?
You're not going to invite us in?
Of course.
Please.
You were chosen by the biggest computer in the galaxy to be the representative of the planet.
Congratulations.
We came to accumulate objective systematical information.
About the conditions on Earth.
This is a confidential mission.
You understand?
"Calm down, please."
Part of our project is to be inconspicuous.
"But if you really arrived from outer space, you would look completely different."
Like what?
For example like green elves or something like that.
We don't like doing this.
Every change of appearance exhausts us.
Doesn't it?
Then we must rest for a long time.
Now do you believe us?
"Excuse me, but why me?"
Why only me?

OVERSEER:
Papers.
"Oh, yeah, I know that."
"Me, on the other hand..."
The doctors say you're going to be fine.
Although you're going to have to wrap your head around the fact that we're really brothers now.
We're blood brothers.
You donated blood ?
"Ah, I had an extra few pints flowing through my veins."
It was no big deal.
Hmm.
You're not a big fan of needles.
"Nor of fainting, it turns out."
But the bank was a little low and us O-negative guys got to stick together.
Hmm.
"That's weird, 'cause all of a sudden I have this strange urge to listen to Death Cab and read comic books."
Really ?
"No, I'm kidding."
"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause if we could have turned this into a body-swap comedy, we could have squeezed another year or two out of this."
Mm.
"So listen, I don't know if I've said this at all today, but..."
You did.
"But after all the times you've saved me, I was up, so..."
All right.
Where's everyone else ?
"How are, how are the girls ?"
"Kirsten, Sandy ?"
"Uh, the girls are fine."
"Veronica Townsend and Pancakes, however, have matching casts."
And Frank is here with Julie and Caitlin.
"He gave me a ride, brought you here."
"Um, but my mom and dad are doing some tests with the doctor, 'cause she fell."
Is it bad ?
"Hey, boys."
"You know, between us he spent his time annoy others."
Look at the comments of his former comrades.
Everyone is happy.
His death brings them satisfaction.
"""Master Sakotaaaa"""
"""Finally dead."""
"""He not deserve to live."""
Yesterday one person died .
Yet there is more people satisfied
"The head of murdering a taxi driver this morning and the theft of her recipe before taking flight from the video of the taxi, it would be the former inmate"
"Otoharada Kuro, 46 ."
The address he gave to his release is false.
It took a notice research to find him.
Done.
He resurfaced Otoharada.
Now I count on you to find him.
Then...
Yagami.
Do not disappoint me.
Yes.
- Return to your quarters!
- Yes.
"Chief, this time..."
"Refer to the jurisdiction, and will investigate."
We must give them every detail.
Yes.
Course.
This Ogiso a big head.
"Yeah, but wait."
The head endures same.
The leader knows the suspect Otoharada?
You not know?
"Yeah, that's a bite mark, all right."
"What do you have to say about that, maestro?"
Gillian must have given me a love bite.
I spent the night with her Sunday.
"Yeah, she told us that."
She also said that you both fell asleep fully clothed.
We had rather a lot to drink.
I took my usual sleeping pill.
My recollection is a little fuzzy.
That's cold.
Teeth marks look bigger than Laura's.
"Well, that happens when there's some swelling of the bite wound."
There.
I'll get the odontologist to confirm.
But it's a match with Laura.
"He clenched her in a bear hug and... lifted her up into the air shaft, her head would have been over his shoulder."
It's consistent with a bite sustained during a struggle.
I hear the fat lady warming up.
"Me, a suspect."
- How outrageous is that?
- I'm sure it's a mistake.
It's done.
You're perfect.
"I'm all bark, Gillian."
You know I wouldn't hurt anyone.
That's the last thing I would want to think.
"But truthfully, Philip, I..."
I don't remember biting you.
You know how much we had to drink.
I just wanted to numb myself.
"Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
Mr. Reinhardt... put your hands on the piano.
The poor thing will fall off
Just flatter Mummy...
it'll do just fine
"Go on, I'll be right back."
Come soon
Giri should be here soon.
Let me show you around
"We built this house a decade ago, outside the city"
We're just 20 minutes away from town
And Giri loves the hustle-bustle
"Say, what's your favourite dish?"
Indian
You turn out to be exactly like Giri
Who's Giri?
Giri Saxena.
Nitu's Papa.
Jai Batra
That's your Mummy?
I took her for your sister
You know Giri hasn't changed in these 25 years
"In my stupidity, I took your simplicity for sex appeal"
Wonderful names.
"Om, Jai and Jagadish"
Why Om-Jai-Jagadish?
Daddy wanted names that... could be said all in one breath.
Therefore...
"Om, Jai and Jagadish"
Jai wants to build the fastest car in the world
And where would you drive your fastest car?
On Indian roads?
Let's think about that once the car has been designed
Is this flat of yours on Juhu sea-facing?
You think she's gonna be psyched?
"Totes, dude."
Why wouldn't she be?
So how does this work?
We just--we show up in Amsterdam and we start calling hotels... and ask if they have a Maria staying there?
- I don't even know her last name.
"- Dude, it's totally cool."
We're definitely gonna find her.
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be--
"Sir, I need you to step aside, please."
Let me search you.
- Did I beep?
"- No, you didn't beep."
Just a random security check.
"If you could just step aside, please?"
Just over here.
"- Random, huh?"
- Yeah.
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?
"Kumar, just do what the guy says."
"Sir, it's our job as airport security... to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs."
"So just because of the colour of my skin, you assume that I have drugs on me?"
"- No, he's--"
"- What are you, a racist?"
Racist?
"Dude, I'm black."
He's black.
He's not a racist.
"Please, dude, you're barely even brown."
"No, he didn't mean that."
"Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry."
I beg your pardon?
Hear our prayers ...
- Where's the lunatic?
- There he is!
- Grab him!
- Seize that lunatic!
- We take care of this.
"- Come with us, madman."
What are you doing?
Benito!
Motherfuckers!
What kind of a joke is this?
Get in!
"Let's go, we saved him!"
- Benito!
- Call me Ben!
I'll fail them!
I'll fail them all.
They're expelled... all of them!
UNDER SHEETS WITH THE DOCTOR
-You erase the slate please
-Immediately
Today we will examine the corpse of a man passed away by peritonitis.
"Pair to see better, you lower to the first rows."
"I see many new faces, students of first course,"
"I go especially to them, if you have never seen a corpse you are not impressed, a corpse is only a person who does not move."
We begin our class of anatomy macrocospic...
We can begin by...
"Well, we can begin our class of anatomy macrocospic."
You take notes.
What is that?
Right.
"Maybe I didn't have a fluorescent suntan, but I'd spent my share of time in pool halls as a kid."
"Of course, that was a long time ago."
- Straight pool?
- Mm-hmm.
"Gee, I haven't played since I learned for Roger."
"In Bayonne, girls in their late 20s, or early 30s, still do that for their men."
Roger and I met playing pool.
I felt this... attraction to him and asked him to teach me.
"When someone's showing you the game, there's a lot of... touching and being close."
"Well, by the end of the evening, he'd asked me out."
It was just like in the movies.
You know what I mean?
I think I can guess.
Excuse me.
"Well, just when I know he's about ready to pop the question, he disappears."
- Ah.
"- Almost a year later, I get this postcard from him... with this P.O. box postmark, you know?"
"Once the writing started again, we burned up the post office."
"I mean torrid, you know?"
"And then, bam!"
A marriage proposal.
Excuse me.
"Well, I was so excited I couldn't sleep for two nights."
And then I telegraphed.
"""Yes. '."""
"And then yesterday, when I got off the plane..."
No Roger.
That's 24 hours you owe me.
Rack 'em up.
Well?
"Well, we do what we have to do."
(BRANCHES BREAKING)
Stop there.
Throw down your weapons.
We're screwed.
Maquis.
And who are they?
These are some assholes.
"Say that again, if you've got the balls."
You are assholes.
Fine.
You asked for it.
(Shoots a blank)
"You're the asshole, who cheats at cards."
"You couldn't beat me at cards if you wore a hood, Mariano."
You know each other?
"Yeah, they also work for the Ministry."
"So, you mean that all this is a joke."
"Yeah, we do it to all the new guys, like you."
Interesting sense of humor you have.
If we don't have a little fun now and then this will be the death of us.
"Come on, let's go."
Not a damn bit funny.
We're almost there.
Are you sure that the translator won't show up in Hendaye?
I took care of him.
"He'll spend a few weeks glued to the toilet,"
I assure you.
Why do I never get to seduce a beautiful woman instead of greasy lechers?
For the same reason we're going to see Hitler and not Ava Gardner.
"Look, her I did meet, but I must be the only one who doesn't brag about it."
Hitler.
There have been too many assholes in this world and I've met a lot of them.
"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
But I can barely see without these.
- Come on.
"- Well, these were expensive."
Let's start the bidding.
So you didn't think this was a date?
"No, not really."
Why?
Is it a date?
I thought it was a date.
"No, it's not a date."
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.
"I mean, it's not like I said hi."
"I mean, the fact is I shouldn't say anything."
"- No, tell me."
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick.
But he was so brave and gained such a wonderful perspective on life.
I fell in love with him.
"Yeah, he's got some perspective there."
"- Hey, you know what the whip does?"
- What whip?
The whip in the Senate and the House.
"Well, in the old days when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to, they whipped them."
"""You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble."""
"She won't talk to anyone, huh?"
"Oh, no, she won't say a word to anybody."
"Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack."
"Well, well, the white whale."
"Alvin, please think about what you're doing."
May I remind you that you are addressing the president of the United States?
"Mr. President, I don't wanna write off any Americans yet."
"Trust me, sir, we'll get your house back for you."
"Mission'sa go,colonel."
"Thank you, sir."
You heard the president.
Six minutes.
"So, what's it like being president?"
It's not like anything.
"Once you get into office, it's all about reelection.."
and what the other side can use against you.
Politics.
You don't start out a politician..
but you become one.
"Just once, though, I wanna do something that's presidential."
"Something along the lines of Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson."
You wanna make history.
No.
Not history.
I wanna make a difference.
If your little daughter says that I'm her hero..
then I gotta earn that.
"All right, we go in low and quiet."
Time to target is two minutes.
"Falcon 2, maintain 30 feet."
"Falcon 1, copy, 30 feet."
Dropto10 feet!
Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C. There's total gridlock through..
"Oh, my God!"
U.S. Special Forces are flying over us!
So.
Cho was killed here.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.
"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-go!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...
That cocksucker.
What kind of twisted freak is he?
THE WAILING (GOKSUNG)
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
ByeOTQQVU-
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-go turns up dead two days ago."
$0?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
Miss!
The two days are up.
"Still no news of him, something bad must have happened."
What should we do now?
"Miss, it's best if we return to BuYeo first."
It doesn't help if we stay here all day.
I... am going to the bandit's hideout myself.
Miss!
"This is not like you, what's wrong?"
What was I like last time?
You were fast and precise.
Sometimes you outshine even the Chief himself.
"Now, you can't even get your priorities right."
You think I'm taking a blind risk?
It's no different from suicide.
What plans do you have?
!
Don't worry.
"After I heard Prince Ju-Mong went to their hideout,"
I regretted not thinking of it earlier.
"As long as I can get Bae-Mang to drop his grudge against me,"
Then we wouldn't have to go back to BuYeo.
"When I was little,"
I remember Father used to tell me this...
"As a merchant,"
One must learn to make business even with an enemy.
I had forgotten the fact that I was a merchant.
You're saying you want to trade with the bandits?
Why not?
"Uncle,"
Please look after the fleet.
Sa-Yong and I will go to the bandit's hideout.
[indistinct shouting]
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
[victor] you will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done
By the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands
Which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
"You're digging your own graves, you fools!"
"You do what we tell you, or you're digging yours."
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOT]
"Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling."
"You haven't got the nerve, Dale."
You can't get away with this.
You'll spend the rest of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.
"Ten seconds or 10 years, the answer will always be the same."
"Listen, you dirty rats in there."
"If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,"
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!
"Is that right, warden?"
Did they kill Pollard?
Never mind.
Don't open the gates.
Get on the phone.
Call for extra help.
"We have, warden."
"It's on the way, sir."
"This is it, Armstrong."
Don't you need the warden to make 'em open up the solitary?
"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
"I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep with Stacey, and you're opening it up for him."
You're heading for the Hole.
Not a chance.
[MEN CHEERING]
"Get them keys, or I give it to Lang on the spot!"
"All right, men, all right!"
All right!
I'll open up.
- Petition!
"- Why fear the word ""mutiny""?"
- I'm not afraid of it if it fits but it don't.
"Seize one ship, that's mutiny."
No one ever got away.
"- Seize the fleet, nothing they can do."
- They can't hang every man.
We'll make them listen to us.
Until then spread the gospel.
Same as back at Spithead.
Yeah.
"Wait, and wait, and wait."
"Yes, Evans."
Wait.
Until the time comes.
"And when the time comes, Vizard..."
Scott-Padget!
"Mr. Kilpatrick, you've been before the board three times."
- Each time you've failed.
"- Yes, sir."
"- What age are you, 33, 34?"
- Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
- Your chances are getting slight.
"- Yes, sir."
Unless the board had reason to believe you had special qualities.
"- Special qualities, sir?"
"- Ingenuity during difficulties courage, loyalty to a particular officer an officer with influence, who might use it."
"Yes, sir."
"I think I see, sir."
"You're in charge of disciplining midshipmen, right?"
- Make them kiss a gunner's daughter.
-How's it going?
"I'm okay, thank you, ish."
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
Yeah.
"So is that right, your mum's been sent to prison?"
"Like, what was it?"
Charges of fraud and gross malfeasance.
-Sounds as if you know all about it.
"-And so she's, like, banged up in there with all those slags and ratbags, like in Bad Girls?"
-It's not quite like that actually in real life.
"-I know, but...."
"Well, she's a pretty major criminal though, yeah?"
-She have to wear one of those uniforms?
"-Yeah, with all the arrows all over it."
Yeah!
"So, what are you doing this afternoon 'cause we're just hanging out?"
"Yeah, I mean, do you fancy coffee?"
"Yeah, of course."
"No, of course I want you to."
It's just I can't make tomorrow or Saturday.
That's all.
How about Sunday?
No.
"No, that would be perfect."
"Oh, my gosh, you'll never guess...."
"There's no question it's been the making of her, this whole business with her mother."
Seems to have turned her into a major celebrity overnight.
I know.
She's got five dates so far on the strength of it to my certain knowledge.
"Kids, I don't know."
Another world.
The chairman of Maruti and I are good friends.
If you say so...
I can talk to him about a job forJai
Jai has several job offers
"All he has to do, is select."
I'll talk to him right away
You aren't doing this for yourself.
You're brilliant.
And we're duds
You can use computers to dig out the exam papers for us
"As morals say, one ought to help pals"
All right.
See me at home tonight
Inside the university's mainframe!
What frame...?
We're inside the university bank.
We just got to break into the papers
Just got to figure out the password.
Of course you will
Let's concentrate
"Go on, smoke."
It's okay
Give me some passwords you know.
I'll give it a try
Shakespeare?
Madhya Pradesh...?
Have you met the managing director?
"Yes, but he wants me To sign up... on an 8-year bond."
Then sign up
"You're staying here, aren't you?"
Why eight?
Sign up for 10 years
Almost never happens.
You know that almost never happens.
"- Hey, where's garrity?"
- He's got the flu.'
"Missing black shawn, now we're missing white shawn."
We're 2 shawns down.
We had to take him to the hospital.White shawn.
- For the flu?
"- He was pissing blood, dude."
"Nah, nah, you don't piss blood when you got the flu."
You piss blood when you got something like gonorrhea.
You do?
Me?
"No.No, no, no."
I never have.
"That's what I heard happens to people who have gonorrhea, which I've never had.Obviously."
I think he had gonorrhea.
"Once, ok."
"Jesus, just once."
One and a half times.
The second time doesn't count because I was just a carrier.
"- Dude, that was awesome."
"- Ahh, we did all right."
"The engine had a dry hydrant which delayed our primary searches, which is why the chief had to call a second alarm.but, most of the apartments above were vacant, which is why we didn't find any roasts."
- Roasts?
- Dead guys.
"Oh, yeah, roasts."
"Hey, let me get in there, you know, check out the damage."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, come on, mike."
Let me in there.
"I mean, the stimulator at school, it's for pussies."
What we get is just the leftovers.
"If we don't get even that now, should we beg?"
Look!
I'm the one who gets directly involved.
I'm the one who takes the maximum risk.
You and him...
You will not get caught for sure.
If I get caught...
I'm done.
Don't cry like a kid.
Go and see what needs to be done.
"If Vasundhara gets to know, we will get into trouble."
The chances of her knowing are very low.
She is with Manoj now.
She will not search for us.
This is the only opportunity we will get.
If we continue like this...
She will treat us like dogs forever.
We can't gain anything from being like that.
Don't think too much.
I have planned everything.
"Talk your girl, Divya."
She has to come.
She must not disclose these details to anyone.
Got it?
Where were you?
You weren't in Kanyakumari for the past 2 days...
"Since we had no work here, we had gone to Kerala."
What is your Manoj saying?
"You left me alone with him, and went on a vacation?"
"You said that if we lure Manoj with money and wealth, we can easily trap him."
He is least bothered about it.
And no one seems to notice I'm so full of shit.
"Like, this one woman was just eating it up."
"And, on one hand, I felt relieved 'cause, you know, I was getting away with it."
But at the same time...
I felt such... contempt for her.
And then things started really getting bad.
The words I was saying didn't even sound like words anymore.
"And then the walls started making that noise, and I just had to get out of there."
"So I'm sitting in my car, and I'm just......"
Just trying to breathe.
And it's like I'm...
I'm breathing ink.
And then I become the ink.
"I'm like this me-shaped bag of black, viscous ink."
"And even now, as I'm talking to you,"
I still feel...
Kind of gelatinous.
And I'm consumed with an unbearable self-loathing.
And I can hear the furniture whispering.
Maybe we should try adjusting your medication again.
Maybe.
I'm guessing either Carol or Willie Nelson was here.
That bad?
Not if you're in a reggae band.
"So, listen, I, um..."
I'm thinking of staying at my place tonight.
What?
No.
I'll just open some windows.
It's not that.
I just think...
It might be easier if I'm in my place.
"I'm sorry, Mike."
ROBERTS:
"I'll get hurt in vesting, at least I'll get partial pension."
Maybe it's for the best.
Wife's coming up.
Got the middle daughter in a ballet recital.
"You know, used to come a time if I went to this recital..."
"... I'dhavemyselfpaged,find  an excuse to go over to Dee Dee's."
"Now I get to see the whole dance of the Enchanted Field Mice, whatever it is."
You want to see me?
You get those test results back?
"Close the door, Larson."
Let me have your gun and your shield.
What for?
Your tests came back with multiple positives.
Steroids--
Hold it.
"Now, steroids are not on the banned-substances list."
Methamphetamines are.
There is no way I tested positive for meth.
That's gotta be wrong.
Testing's sophisticated now.
Can't cover your tracks with sudafedrin.
You're terminated as of tomorrow.
You report to 1 Police Plaza...
... forout-processingin themorning.
Your gun and your shield.
This is a setup.
"If you think that I am gonna sit still for this, you are crazy."
"I am gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue your asses."
You have two guns listed.
Give the other one to the sergeant before you leave.
"When you want a story, all you have to do is ask."
Bye.
Don't you want to get out of the box?
Can you tell me a story?
People story or animal story?
Happy or sad?
"A thriller, comedy or horror?"
Made-up or real?
A story about people.
Your story.
Mine?
- Don't you have a story?
- Sure.
- Can't you tell me?
- I guess so.
"I was born, and I had a lot of brothers."
My mother used to tell us stories so we should not think about eating.
"Then I grew up, got married and had a bunch of children."
I told them the same stories my mother used to tell me.
"I grew old, my husband died and one by one, my kids went away."
So I kept reciting stories aloud to myself.
I told them in the streets.
Some of the passers-by liked them and gave me some change.
"One day, your grandma came up to me and asked:"
"""Would you tell your stories to my grandchild for food and shelter?"
"She said I could eat myself sick, if I wanted."
"I agreed, so they put me in that box."
"Before they closed me up,"
I asked if I'd get paid on the spot.
"""Once my grandchild opens her present, you can eat,"" she said."
"Well, that's my story."
May I eat now?
"Do you think Tarbuck's a feminist, then?"
"Lesie Crowthery, Eddie, Lesie Crowthery."
Just another one of the great guys that make up my showbiz gang that I belong to and you don't.
"Now, shut up, I'm telling you the great anecdote."
"- ""Lynchy lined up to tee off. """
- I wish you'd tee off and let me smoke my fags in peace.
"""Lynchy lined up to tee off and said to me,"
"""'Gosh, Tarbo, we swigged so much pop last night,"
"""'being great guys together and such great big showbiz mates,"
"""'that I bet I miss this next shot. '"
"""And blow me down but he did."
"He missed it. """
"Oh, oh, oh."
Ha ha ha ha.
"Oh, ha ha!"
"Oh, touché, Tarby."
"Oh, that was brilliant."
"No, the same thing has happened to me fumfty times."
We-hell.
I can see it's gonna be a scintillating evening with everyone cracking brillo gags like that one.
Yeah.
Hey.
Maybe there's a series in it.
Dinner At Richie's.
An ultra-sophis chat show.
Good evening.
This is the BBC.
"Tonight, Sir Richie Rich will be talking to the Queen, the Pope and, of course, the Tarby."
It'd be a disaster.
You'd get drunk and make a pass at the Pope for wearing a dress.
Bloody good telly though.
"So, what incredible 12 courses will you cook for your fantastically amiable showbiz chums?"
"Unh-uh!"""
"""I'm from Brooklyn."
"""I'm from do-or-die Bed-Stuy Brooklyn."
You took my spot.
"I don't play that."""
"The lady was like, ""So?"
"I'm from Oakland."""
"My mom said, ""Y'all get in the car."""
"I said, ""Wait a minute, Mama!"""
You supposed to fight her!
"Don't be a punk!"""
"She said, ""Baby, I'm not a punk."
I'm a survivor.
"That's what the hell I am."""
"You don't mess with people from Oakland, folks."
You just don't do it.
"Even in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you notice they went over that Golden Gate Bridge, but they did not mess with the Bay one?"
Did you notice that?
"'Cause there would have been far more dangerous creatures on the other side, just waiting for 'em like,"
"""Hold on, bruh."
"""Hey, yo, who these Flavor Flav-looking niggas, bruh..."
"""coming over here with these ashy knuckles, nigga?"
"Who the fuck are these peop--"" The movie wouldn't have been called Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
It would have been called The Apes Died in Oakland.
There would have been no sequel.
Don't do it.
"Apes were gangster, man."
You ever had a gangster situation just happen to you?
"Like you, right here."
"She's like, ""No."""
"""I was at the HM the other day,"
"""and I switched the $4.95 tag"
I am putting you two on it.
As captains?
"Or should I say, crap-tains?"
"Hey, everybody!"
I got spinning wheels for Barbara's carriage.
Now's it's not just her attitude that's gangster.
"Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?"
I'm trying to set up my new wireless headphones.
Gonna make my walkman sound amazing.
This is ridiculous.
"I'm trying to keep things on the down-low, and you three went on the biggest shopping spree since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Wait a minute.
"Han, why are you taller than the counter?"
Just been eating right and getting enough sleep.
"Yeah, something's weird."
You're almost the height of an adult penguin.
Fine!
I treated myself to lifts.
I was sick of being nose to butt with everyone on the subway.
Check out Caroline's Instagram.
Looks like they're in more trouble than I was the last time I tried to put on overalls.
"Ooh, they're on a tugboat filled with toilets, and she writes, ""Help."
"Please send money."""
So... quick unfollow?
Or sleep on it and pow-wow in the morning?
No.
We have to help them.
I lost the cord to these headphones anyway.
"Oh, still got toilet boat legs."
"Ugh, this place reeks of bait."
"Oh, no, wait."
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry.
There's no more to tell.
"Hello, Allison."
- You look well.
- With a drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"Well, this is an unexpected pleasure."
Do come in.
It is wiser to telephone.
Please sit down.
Would you like a drink?
I do hope this isn't an appeal to my better nature.
- I haven't one.
- No.
"You might as well know, my engagement's broken off."
"I'll never see Bill again, so it's no good you going on blackmailing me because I haven't a penny in the world."
This is shocking news.
But 16 Texan oil wells shouldn't be thrown away.
That doesn't matter.
You wouldn't understand.
"I really love him, and I'm nobody without him, so, please, please, leave me alone."
"I'm sorry, but it would still make a good supporting feature."
"""Lurid past loses luckless model Texan oil millions."""
- (Sobs)
"- Look, my dear."
You'll be better off trying to win him back than wasting your time and mine.
What the d...?
!
"- (West Country accent) Sorry, sir."
- What are you doing here?
"they keep asking about you, what you know."
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
I know where the Ark is Marion.
The Ark is here?
Well I'm coming with you Jones!
"Get me out of here, Cut me loose!"
You can't leave me here!
If I take you out of here now they will start combing the place for us.
Jones you got to get me out of here!
Are you crazy?
You know that I hate to do this.
"You just Sit still, keep quiet."
This whole thing is going to be shut.
I'll be back to get you.
That's it.
"Who knows, perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some anti chamber for us to discover."
Perhaps it's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
"She was in possession of the original piece for years, she may know much if properly motivated."
I tell you the girl knows nothing.
I'm surprised to find you squeamish that is not your reputation.
"But it needn't concern you, I have the perfect man for this kind of work."
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We hit stone!
Clear it off.
Come on find the edges.
"Good, good, good."
You see Indy?
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.
"Like ""Apocalypse Now"" down there."
Like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards, you send him home."
"I was, you know, ""He's out getting an evidence bag, and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture""."
So are you home for good?
"No, no."
Playing it by ear.
"""To be determined."""
Think you might want to
- talk it through with somebody?
- What?
A shrink?
"No, no."
I can't.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know,"
I don't know how to say this.
"You know, the things I deal with, you and me don't have much of a... what you might call an experiential overlap."
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen."
50 years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis...
- And the goods are still in the safe?
- Oh yes!
"Don't fret, if anything goes wrong, we'll do the fire brigade!"
"Don't get any funny ideas, you leach!"
"""Story by:"""
"See, you bunch of jerks?"
"Oh, shit!"
Tell me again how you pull these things off?
"I've put the luggage in coach 15, compartment 21!"
"And for the first time in history, even the train from Hungary is on time!"
"If I had wheels, I'd always be on time."
Hey cornflake!
Do you breathe at night?
"In Budapest, we hoped that everything was better here - even sleep."
Is that why you're wearing your best pajamas?
These are all I have.
I'm not rich.
"But, my mother was French."
Is French all you speak?
"He speaks lingo with his mouth, Yugoslav with his hands,"
"Japanese with his feet, Arabic with the ladies, and French with his..."
Fuck!
Drop it!
Drop what?
"It means, crawl off, like when you stamp on something creepy with your clog."
You dig clogs?
of course!
"Clogs, dig..."
Me... my father died a year back.
"My mother three months later, because she loved him."
We need foreign invitations to leave Hungary.
"The daughter of the sister of my mother who is a movie star - do you say ""star""?"
We know that you were his dealer.
Okay.
I think we're done here.
I don't know anything about drugs.
"And just so we're super clear on that,"
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.
Thanks.
"Okay, you do that."
"You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time."
But that's when I get started.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'll be all over you.
"Whatever you do, buy, sell, I'll be watching you."
That's actually called harassment.
It is.
It's called harassment.
"You really want to do that to your business, Jake?"
"Look, we're just after whoever actually killed Aldo Clemens."
My hunch is killing isn't exactly your thing.
"Answer some questions, I'll be out of your life."
I might have known this guy.
"If I did,"
I would have dropped him as a client months ago.
He run out of money?
No.
They always find the money.
Aldo... had become a risk.
"Some guy was following him, so I cut him off."
Who was following Aldo?
You got a name?
I can't even tell you what he looked like.
He was some guy in a crappy car.
!
What the hell?
!
Do not!
My truck!
Damn Noids.
Curse!
Look at this shit.
Ash scraped the engine and the whole system.
For the repair we need a GMM.
- A GMM?
"""A great damn hammer, you idiot!"""
The equipment and the ammunition are ashes!
We are 100 miles from the base.
A long way home without snow shoes.
Without Ash we're not going anywhere.
"The first time I agree with you, Bishop."
At the edge of the death zone is a probe with emergency equipment.
"If we get there, we have a chance."
Let's go hunting again.
You do not have to worry about hounding Ash.
... he will hunt us!
"The Humanoids were created, ready to serve."
They are stronger than we are and manage the weather.
"They are hairless, His blood is sour and black."
They are like mules and can not reproduce.
A security measure against genetic competition in the future.
Its Creator said:
His tranquility rests in Absence of reproduction.
But something is different now.
The rebellion is spreading.
"They fight until his death, something to protect."
"Lost thousands in company stock, he was recently laid off, and if Wickes Steel goes under, he will likely lose his pension."
SECNAV's green plan ruined this guy.
Sounds like a motive to me.
McGEE:
"If Ridgeway did it, he had help."
There's no way he's got the skills to break through AUTEC's firewall.
I found a post of his on a PC forum asking what a cookie is.
(laughs) Old people.
Old people entertain me.
"I can tell you Wickes didn't have the know-how to pull off this AUTEC job, either."
I think we're looking at a team.
So you determined from the interview that Wickes is involved?
(clears throat)
My findings were inconclusive.
GIBBS:
Any contact between Wickes and Ridgeway?
Not a peep out of Wickes since we let him go.
Wickes is a chess player.
It doesn't surprise me that he's taking some time before he makes his next move.
"McGee, get me a location on Ridgeway."
On it.
"DiNozzo, Ziva, get going."
"Oh, um, instead of"
"Wink Martindale here,"
I think I'd like to send Elliott.
TONY:
Wink?
"Come on, at least go Chuck Woolery."
"No, let me at him."
I'm the king of non-verbal indicators.
"Yes, he is."
"Unless, of course, somebody blocks his view."
We're not going to sleep.
We're not?
Mmm-mmm.
What we gonna do in there?
For real?
So how was your night?
My husband found himself in a very traumatic shark situation.
Here we go.
"As we were planning to go to the waterfall and have a romantic evening, because, as you know, we don't do that very often because of the kids and work..."
"But somehow, this crazy, traumatic shark experience was enough to make him neglect his wife."
"Ronnie, nice to meet you."
Well said.
"David, how did that make you feel?"
I know my truth.
Excuse me?
I know my truth.
"Did you say, ""l know my truth',?"
"Oh, boy."
"Listen, I'm telling you, you getting on my last nerve!"
"Yo, I didn't sign up for this!"
"Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing."
You said we was gonna be partying.
You said we was gonna be doing what we do.
"You made promises, Daddy."
"Boo-Boo, look, they got me doing a lot of activities."
What do you expect from me?
I'm tired.
You tired?
"Yo, I'm tired."
"Plain and simple, I ain't having it."
"Sometimes we forget how to do the easiest thing in the world, which is just to talk to each other."
"Okay, let's start here."
Yes!
I am a criminal!
The people of the crime world are scared of me!
I am a disgrace on the name of humanity!
I know!
I know that you hate me!
You think Im not a nice man!
But I believe that no man in the world is bad.
No one is a born criminal!
No thief robs forthe sake of pleasure.
No criminal commits any crime for his pleasure.
No prostitute sells her body for her pleasure.
Time and circumstances.
Time and circumstances force a person to become bad!
And you know very well that a person who dies due to..
"..poverty or starvation, his final riots are not conducted."
"From that time.. from that time, I have Iearntjust one.."
"..thing from life, I have understoodjust one thing.."
..from life that it is not a crime or a sin to be born..
"..as a poor, but dying due to poverty.."
"..is the biggest crime, the biggest sin!"
Bravo!
Bravo!
It is the biggest crime..
-Thats our hero!
Heres our hero!
wonderful.
Mind blowing.
My discovery!
Cut!
"I swear upon God, you were outstanding!"
The truth is that I have been happyjust twice.
That's not dumb.
That's cute.
"Look, I don't know who my dad is."
And...
"If I stop believing that anything is possible, it feels like I'm shutting the door on ever meeting him."
Can I stop making this face?
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna cry.
"Well, your crying face is dumb, too, so go ahead."
I'll end it with Everett.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just curious.
Why Egypt?
I figure it's so far away that no one will ever follow me there.
"Seriously, you know Riley Elliott?"
Yeah.
We dated for six months.
"We're on a break right now, but you never know."
Hmm.
You've blocked my entire life's work!
You ruined my career!
Whoa.
"I just think that you have some incredible skills, Mary, and I would love to see you channel those talents into something good."
Oh.
"For your information,"
I have done a lot of good!
Did you know that I was the number one download for Operation Desert Freedom?
What have you ever done for our troops?
I was really nice to one in an airport shuttle one time.
"Okay, if you want to help me, Aaron, then just let me be who I am."
Accept me for who I am.
Not a lot of people in my life have done that.
I just want a mate.
You just want to mate?
!
I just want a mate.
"You're not mating with me, sunshine!"
"A mate, I want a mate."
"Well, just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense."
"I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, you know, alien nothing."
"There we are, then."
Okay.
I think the pair of them together were pretty amazing.
It proves that you don't need to have romantic tension to have a male and a female character with a dynamic relationship.
"Oh, ha ha!"
That's just -- car keys.
What?
I've still got my mum's car keys.
I won't be a minute.
"Donna's end, as a companion, broke my house."
My wife and I were just inconsolable.
"She basically becomes a Time Lord herself, but, because she's physically human, she can't handle it and her brain's going to burn and the Doctor has to wipe her memory of everything they've done together."
Don't make me go back.
"Doctor, please, please, don't make me go back!"
Donna.
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
But we had the best of times.
The best.
Goodbye.
"No, no, no, please."
"Please, no, no."
No!
No!
She was a receptionist.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you very much.
¡Gordon!
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear.
and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
You should not say that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air."
Flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
- There is hardly any.
"I've heard, ladies used to fancy their dresses, longtime ago."
"But nowadays, why have you ladies become so stingy about it?"
"Now look, what I like to wear is my personal matter."
I see.
"Just like the loafer's personal matter was to whistle, right?"
Any matter which troubles others cannot be personal.
But how does this dress trouble others?
This question suits the loafer who whistled at you.
"An_ay, you seem to be a decent girl from a decent family."
"Ifyou put on some decent dress, then I think it won't trouble anyone."
"An_ay, it's your wish."
"Sawant, take down her complaint."
What's his name?
He just doesn't possess any kind of etiquette.
My case is fixed on the 21th.
And the witness...
Don't talk about the court.
This is a pam.
Have fun.
This is the first time I see you on time.
And...
"Hello, Mr Sahney!"
Have you met my daughter Sheetal?
Hello
"- Sheetal, he is a famous criminal lawyer."
"Mr Sahney, please come with me."
"- Hey, Mr Mehta!"
I've read about your Nihar murder case in the newspapers.
You were just incredible and you won the case.
Really?
Are you interested in such things?
A magic trick?
"- Yeah, I'm talking about a magic trick."
- No.
I used to do it during college exams.
"I can make it appear, I can make it disappear."
We can't risk giving him another agent as a hostage.
We have to do something.
"- All right, Reid, let's go."
Teach it to me.
- What?
No.
"Look, if you can do it, I can do it."
Show it to me.
I've been practicing this my whole life.
We have less than 30 minutes.
"Reid, I am not about to let you get on that train with an armed psychotic."
"We don't have any other choice, do we?"
No.
We don't have any other choice.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of the top physicists in the world.
He's written hundreds of papers on M-Theory.
I don't understand any of it.
"Oh, he worked for the government for several years in the '80s."
Probably the source of his delusions.
He's been institutionalized for the past nine years.
Until Dr. Deaton took him on a field trip.
Yeah.
What we need is a strategy.
- I'll try to talk to him.
- You think that's wise?
What would she have?
Seriously.
That ajumma knows how to subtly put on airs.
Yeah.
Unni Jin Ok can't come today?
Why?
She was scammed?
You want me to h-hold it?
The rumors are already spread all over this place that I was scammed by con artists.
I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face anyone.
"Jang Jin Ok, the name that used to have influence everywhere I went, it's become so that I can't use it anywhere now!"
Then... simply change your name.
It only takes a week.
Do you really want to die!
No.
I have to be cool-headed about this.
I-I heave to be cool-headed about this.
Here.
Take this.
Ok.
Then what should we do now?
We should catch them.
That's right.
No amount of money is too large.
Catch them.
"After screwing up my good son's life, and making me this embarrassed."
My husband is getting a tax audit...
I mean... can he persecute us like this just because we have money?
Of course not.
"Make sure to catch them, especially the punk who pretended to be a prosecutor, make sure to catch him."
"Even if you have to kill him, catch him."
Ah!
Don't we have to assume foul play?
Don't we have to assume foul play?
Let's not make reckless accusations.

"What's your reading, Malcolm?"
"Oh, we reckon it's all a bit suss, you know."
"Oh, we reckon it's all a bit suss, you know."
Something doesn't smell right.

So why would he disappear?
Well...
I get that.
It's an important case.
I gotta go.
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee."
"Hey, tell everyone I said hi, okay?"
"Yeah, you bet."
Bye.
Let's get back to work.
(siren wailing)
"The victim is Corporal Jared Connors, 28,"
Fourth Marine Division.
"Drove here regularly when he was on leave, he even raced in the amateur circuit a few times."
Experienced driver.
Apparently.
"Him and the girlfriend, Dana Wells, were the only drivers on the track when he crashed."
Lost control of his car?
"Yeah, except his father thinks he was murdered."
Russ Connors is a mechanic on one of the racing teams.
Told the sheriffs he's convinced the car was sabotaged.
Sabotage?
Why does he think that?
"Well, I didn't get to talk to him."
"He got cut pretty bad taking his son out of the wreck, so..."
Paramedics took and the girlfriend to the hospital.
Think that's case-related?
More like trouble in paradise.
I don't think he and Melody are getting along right now.
"Well, it can't be easy..."
"Woman pops into his life, surprises him with a baby."
At least Lasalle's trying to do the right thing.
"Just wish it didn't affect his work so much, undermanned as it is."
Sustained blood loss?
"Essentially, yes."
"Poor Number Four had, er..."
"Epstein-Barr, but I don't think that's what took him in the end."
You buried them in your garden like gerbils.
"- My God, they were human beings!"
- Precisely.
"You see, the depravity of the human heart knows no bounds."
"Name your blackest desires, and somewhere, out in the sweating mass of humanity, you'll find someone all too happy to gratify them."
These men were clearly ill.
Men?
Number Three was a lady.
"I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong."
"I had everything, on paper."
Came from a good family.
Met my wife.
Had a family of my own.
It wasn't enough.
I felt... ordinary.
But with Richard and Emma...
"well, I'm special."
Not that special.
There were six others before you.
Out of billions.
I matter here.
- I'm happy.
- See?
"But one day, all this... will kill you."
"Well, better a short life filled with pleasure than a long one searching forjoy."
"You see, you may not understand our little arrangement here, but at least accept it works."
"Oh, take two."
We want you to be big and strong.
And I'm still waiting on the reply.
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.
Fine.
Go !
"Frank, hi, it's Julie."
I hope you're okay.
"Caitlin and I are fine, I mean, we're trapped at the ice cream store on the pier, but we're fine."
I guess help is probably on the way.
"Okay, well... take care, bye."
"Look, I understand why you keep on calling Summer and the Cohens, but why Frank ?"
"I mean, weren't you guys supposed to take it down a notch ?"
"Caitlin, just because we're pulling things back a little bit doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about each other."
"I'm sure wherever Frank is, he's worried about us, just like I am about him."
"And I am about myself, because we're stuck here with him."
"The back door is stuck, too."
Looks like there's no way out.
We're trapped.
Figures.
We can't just sit here waiting to be rescued.
Totally.
"No, we should start eating all the melting ice cream."
I want a gold medal ribbon on a...
"Sugar cone, I know."
"Creepy, but convenient."
"Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping."
"It's Gary, my name."
Okay.
"I'm thinking the roof, or where the roof used to be."
"Ice-cream guy, got a ladder ?"
You can't climb up there.
"I'm not going to, you are."
TheWorstof theWorst
"It's her, right?"
Give me the phone now.
No Jik!
Thepersonyouare tryingtocall-
What's wrong?
I told you to give me that girl's number.
"No matter how you look at it, she's messing with a student."
Is Sin Joon Young that great?
Yeah he is.
This girl isn't that weird either.
She's normal but Joon Young is so awesome that he's even able to change her.
I'm not saying that right now.
Don't fall for Joon Young.
-What?
-If your always around him filling the documentary then you'll definitely fall for him.
This rascal...
You dont know Jin Joon.
Joon Young is know a person in a different world now.
Joon Young's saying something without thought.
Don't be mistaken and don't get any useless hope.
You'll get hurt.
Did you eat something wrong this morning?
That's right.
"Those ribs must have tasted weird, right?"
"So that's why I told you to stay away from them and not to eat them, you punk!"
"Noona, I hope you and Hyung will have nice courtship."
Even if he doesn't have anything he's a really good person and you fit with him.
That's the way that you'll be happy.
Then this is the end of my nagging.
No Euly!
Film the documentary well.
He's telling you I'm not real.
He is lying to you.
You're lying to me.
That's Leo speaking.
That's not even Dr. Bryar.
"Why don't you let him think for himself, Leo?"
You...
Can you see him?
"- Yeah, he's right there."
- Shoot this kid.
Why don't you let him make his own decisions?
Shoot him!
The voices.
"They helped you, right?"
It's where you get your ideas from.
"While the other kids were outside in the playground, you were inside reading, studying, learning."
The voices wouldn't stop.
They helped you understand things that other people could never realize and...
"Then as you grew older, it became almost a responsibility."
Right?
A responsibility to use that ability.
To use your knowledge.
String theory.
The Theory of Everything.
"Shoot him, Ted."
"Then M-Theory, encompassing all the strings, unifying the theories."
"- Don't push him, Reid."
- You know what's funny?
Most people say that M-Theory can never be proved because the mathematical tools do not yet exist.
- Don't push him.
"- But you see it, right?"
Am I right?
Well...
We'll think about it.
"Well, how about this:"
Whoever gets out of their beanbag first gets what they want?
"Everyone, you are now free to date people in the office."
"Our not very long, extremely local nightmare is over."
"Hey, you got the ban lifted?"
Yeah... isn't that what you wanted?
Only when it was never going to happen!
I lied before.
"I am scurred, I am..."
I'm just a big ol' scurredy cat.
"I just, I really don't want to mess this up with Emma."
"Look, I know more about women than anyone except Gloria Steinem and John Mayer."
"I've picked up women in nine languages, and I only know five."
"As Jack Gordon, colon, Man of Action... copyright pending..."
I'm going to help you ask out Emma.
"Okay, I will gladly accept your help."
And I'm going to start a binder right now
- with some subsections and...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
You are not going to overthink this.
"My plan has one step, and that's called ""taking action""..."
Emma!
Clark has something he'd like to ask you.
No.
"Hey, Emma, I was just wondering... [laughing]:"
"Hey, it's Clark, from work."
What's up?
"Pretty good, pretty good."
[muttering]
I just wanted to know if maybe you want to hung out sometime?
- Report this:
the time travel is complete.
The visitors calling CWB.
We have 2 and a half minutes.
Send us some rope quickly.
The time travel is complete.
There is no need for any ropes.
Perhaps with a slight adjustment...
The signal is not clear.
"Give me the parameters, please."
CWB's question:
What kind of rope?
And what kind of adjustment?
It seems there was a mistake in the calculations.
Because we are at the top of a rocky hill right now.
60 meters above the country road between Bournak and Kamenice.
Poochie!
Third check.
No errors found.
"By CWB's estimate, the error must have occurred during mission execution."
The mission is dangerous.
You don't say.
Tell them that!
"What do you mean, I should tell them?"
That we cannot send another Expedition after them?
The World Council approves their return.
Based on CWB's data.
You know what?
The CWB can go and hang itself by the neck.
Explain!
The return would be risky.
It could deplete all the energy reserved for emergencies.
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
"Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!"
But it wasn't her fault...
"Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us."
"Yeah, yeah."
And we tried to...
"but we couldn't, and he... [growls] And..."
And we...
Whoa!
[Sighs] And then we were safe.
"But then this seagull came, and it was, ""This is this..."""
Seagull?

Oh!

- Didn't you?

"Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?"

Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
"Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!"
"As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!"
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
Come on.
Will you stop it?
Jesse will be here any minute and I need to practice.
Or you could not tell him and before you know it.
We're off to college together sharing a dorm room.
Where I have to listen to you complainin' about how bad you feel.
For not coming clean to Jesse and there's no place for me to hide.
Because I'm trapped with you in a 12-by-12 foot concrete cell.
That's filled with tear-soaked tissues dripping in snot!
"On second thought, yeah, maybe you should tell him."
Well that was a long trip for nothing.
How long have you known me?
Point taken.
[Doorbell ringing]
Now get out of here.
No hang on.
If you're gonna tell him about Hannah.
I should tell him about Lola.
Lilly no one...
Cares!
I get it.
I get it.
"Wow, I really want to tell you you get more beautiful."
Every time I see you.
But that'd be going against my brooding rocker image.
So I'm just gonna say: hey.
That works for me.
"Oh, sweet niblets, can't you at least warn a guy?"
Good thing I got that Smokey and the Bandit marathon running on cable.
You sounded a little nervous on the phone.
Is everything okay?
[Sighs] I'm fine.
What's garbage like you doing with garbage like this?
"Come on, open her up."
"It's the only job I can get, seeing as how people are so damn discriminant... against those who have paid their dues."
Discriminant?
"Hell of a word there, Clive."
But it ain't your word.
"What did you do with the other truck, huh?"
You're gonna start walking...
Hey.
"What you got there, boy?"
You spit that out.
Spit it out!
You spit that out!
Huh?
"Come on, get up."
Get up!
What?
Is it the stew-maker?
"Hear the cartel has a guy, dissolves people in acid, puts them in a barrel, makes them soup."
Is that who I'm waiting for?
Is it you?
My job is to place a call at 7:30.
And if you don't make the call?
You get put on a list.
And if you get put on the list... it's unfortunate.
"But if Clive isn't here in the next 15 minutes... soon enough, I'll be talking to a dead man."
Well...
If I'm already dead...
You're a dead man!
You ain't doing too good a job at staying gone.
"You know, sometimes..."
I can't get through an entire day without hearing all kinds of rumors getting told about you.
(music fades)
"You like that, Stewie?"
You like Anne Murray's music?

I've never known such happiness.

I just bought you new sneakers.

"Shut up, and stop complaining."
"When I was your age, I didn't even have sneakers."
We wore stale hamburger buns.
"No, you didn't, Peter."

Did you see his shoes?
"Look, Chris, I'm sorry, but money's tight right now."
"Yeah, I even had to take a second job as a door-to-door vacuum salesman."

You're a Spaniard.

Politics.
I am what is called afrancesado...

I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decidedtotakeon a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
but he was already a legend.
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.
The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
The Irishman is here to take you Guineas' money.
Want a drink?
Give me a Seven and Seven.
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Thank you.
Keep them coming.
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.

It was business.

He went out.
And it was a surprise.
"And it hurt, you know, that it happened."
And that he didn't tell me.
And that he lied to me.
It just really shook me up.
He was my Eskimo.
He got me sober.
I just thought that we could tell each other the truth.
"But today, I'm trying to focus on the positives."
I have this new business venture that I'm really excited about.
And I'm just trying to be grateful.

"Now, young one, you're obviously not at one with this world yet and that is OK, but listen, let me help you."
"Because deep within all of us is a spirit animal, a spiritual guide."
"Now, most people don't allow this animal to take control, but you must."
Mm-hmm.
"Now my animal is a panther, strong, sleek, unafraid."
His...
Mine is a curious goat.
That was it.
That's nice.
"Well, you know, it's all right, I'm slightly ashamed of it."
You must never be ashamed of your spirit animal.
"Yeah, but it's easy for you to say, you're a panther."
Why did you pick a goat?
"You don't choose your spirit animal, it chooses you."
"Yes, of course."
"We're going to find yours, Dermot."
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Shut your eyes.
Now clear that little mind of yours.

Wow!
Chocolate bon-bons from L'atelier de Bonheur.
"To be honest, I've never had one of these before."
You can't find Bonheur chocolates in Japan.
My friend who went to Paris for vacation brought these back.
These are for you.
How is it?
It's very smooth.
"It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of bitterness."
"With its rich chocolate aroma and wonderful texture, the overall impression it gives is amazing."
Yeah.
"- It's a tender taste, right?"
It gently unravels your heart.
To be able to eat Bonheur chocolates in Treluyer's shop is such a luxury.
"But this means we've brought in food from outside, right?"
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"But I, love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world."
"Geez, I'm totally jealous of French people who can eat this every day."
Mmmm!
I want to make chocolates like this one day.
I remember that a little bit differently.
Your parents didn't want you hanging out with me when I was pregnant.
Right.
But they came around eventually.
"Of course, I don't think you're their favorite friend."

But she didn't get pregnant.
And my parents like her parents.
"My parents like your parents, too."
"I don't think they'd go away on vacation with your parents or anything, but... (SIGHS)"

I'm happy for you that Kathy made some friends.

Why can't I go meet Madison?

Hi.
"Hey, Grace."

"Um, I don't guess that you'd maybe want to do something tonight, would you?"

"Um, but, I mean, you've never not been my friend and I've never not been your friend."
"We haven't been close, but we haven't not been close."
"Right, yeah."
And I owe it all to you that I have a job at the church nursery.
I'll always be grateful to you for that.
Thank you.
"Although, being grateful is not quite the same as being a friend."
"Even if she agrees, she's my age and time has taken it's toll on her"

I also liked the mouvement of one the characters.
It's the first picture on which I made the outlines blurry.
Very blurry.
But only to let this white in.
"The white of the frame, inside the picture itself."
"It's very London-ish, isn't it?"
I've never been.
That's true.
Where is this window?
Where do you think?
"The order, the greenery, the grass..."
"The fields, the trees.."
It's Britain...
Britain...
The heart of civilization.
It seemed to me...
Strangely I took this picture while I wasn't feeling well...
"When I wasn't feeling well, I took very ordered pictures."
"Very composed, with this..."
There's a little string.
"A little string of a roller blind, ready cover the whole image."
So you took this picture to show something of Britain?
No exit.
It's like the bullet went in... and vanished.
"Look at this, Al."
Someone dragged her onto that dock.
"Oh, come on."
Lots of women have scuffed-up heels on their shoes.
"No, not Hilla."
Her friend told me that Hilla always kept her clothes perfect.
"Whoever killed her, dragged her to the end of the dock."
"I hate to tell you this, Sherlock, but she could have shot herself."
Where's the gun?
Maybe it fell into the lake.
"No, I don't think so."
Why not?
"If Hilla committed suicide, I wouldn't be here."
The only thing that makes sense is that I'm here to find out who murdered her.
"[ Sam Narrating ] Whenever I quantum leap, I get to see what it's like to walk in another man's shoes."
And sometimes what it's like to drive in his car.
"I knew very little about Hilla, except that she survived a war when everyone else in her family died."
She was either lucky or had a strong will to live.
One of these had run out on her.
I had to find out which one.
Greg.
Ah.
Melvin.
How you doin'?
Fine.
Fine.
"Uh, we're just wrapping up for winter here."
Uh-
"- Um, could you tell me which room was Hilla's?"
The key doesn't have a number on it.
"Now look, you listen to me."
I did not kill my wife.
"You want to know who took Sara Collins, don't waste your time talking to me."
Talk to the senator.
Why would I do that?
Because he knows who did.
You think you know what's going on.
You haven't even sucked one drop off the tip of that iceberg.
"Listen, your wife was alive for two months before they killed her."
"Now, either they wanted something from her... or they wanted something from you."
Best way to get to a man is through the woman he loves.
That's how they control you.
Who?
Do you know how she was killed?
We believe she was drowned.
Where?
"Oh, my God...!"
This is all my fault.
It won't end.
You give Jeff Collins a message from me.
He can fry in hell.
No!
It was a damn witness interview.
I did not see that coming.
"Graham, there was nothing you could've done."
I pushed him there.
You don't push someone to take their own life after a two-minute interview.
"If you keep beating yourself up, you're no good to this case and you know it."
All due respect.
Did you get a sense of what might have set them off.
Guilt.
Guilt?
Here we are.
Till death do us part.
Of course the security guard didn't see me.
I was asleep on the sofa.
"Are you sure that's where you were, Tom?"
You didn't go home instead?
Get into an argument?
No.
But she was angry with you?
We were happy.
Didn't stop you playing away though?
I wouldn't.
I loved her.
"You loved her so much, you had to change the bed sheets?"
You know where that bed sheet is now?
It's in our lab being tested.
"What are they gonna find, Tom?"
A loving fiance or a cheating liar?
Guv wants a word.
Interview suspended at 9:50.
Greenwich just called.
A woman's been attacked outside her flat by a minicab driver.
You think there's a link?
Victim is a temp at the forensic service lab where Kelly worked.
I was working late.
So I didn't want to risk the walk to the tube.
And there was this minicab parked up right near where I work.
He said he'd just dropped someone off.
Can you remember the name of the cab company?
"No, I'm sorry."
"He took you back to your place, yeah?"
I was halfway down the steps to my flat before I realised he was behind me.
"And you can get completely out of the habit of it, you see?"
"And before you know it, your neck muscles are straining and your eyes are doing all these crazy things."
So you just went out and picked up the first guy you saw?
He wasn't the first.
Th-The first three said no.
"Wow, it's like a romance novel."
He said I was foxy.
"When I say it out loud, it doesn't really seem like a good enough reason to sleep with somebody, but... it was 10:00 at night, on a sidewalk, in front of a grocery store, you know?"
I was all good to go.
"Please don't tell me any more, mother of my child."
"And then I tried to break up with him today, but he made me a mix tape."
Supertramp?
They are so good.
"I know it sounds a little pitiful, but, I mean, it was my first time out there, and I just..."
I-I wasn't sure if anybody was gonna want me.
Are you kidding?
"Christine, you're incredibly sexy."
"In fact, sometimes I still scream out your name during sex."
"Oh, you do?"
"Oh, shut up!"
She has my same name!
That's true.
But I still think you're sexy.
"Well, yeah, whatever."
Anyway...
"I got one under my belt, okay?"
I feel good.
Now I can move on.
- You gonna get that?
- No.
"Oh, this is ridiculous."
I got to do this.
- These were all his decisions?
- Yeah.
We just gave him the stage and he ran with it.
- I hope we got his business number.
- So good.
"Project Jenny, Project Jan is this band here."
- This guy was so good.
"- By the way Jeremy who plays Randy, when we made out in the first club scene and we made out for a while, and he was getting married the next day."
It was like a really funny thing.
It felt like I was his bachelor party.
I didn't find that out until the end of the day.
I felt guilty that I asked him to do that when he's getting married the next morning.
It's a hell of a bachelor party.
- It's all acting.
- Yeah.
- He was in character.
- He's a cool guy.
- Look at his guy.
Look at his guy.
"- This guy, I mean..."
"- Look, he's shameless."
- Somebody get this guy a show.
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
The shot looks like it was orchestrated to highlight the backflip.
- But it wasn't.
It was just in there.
- It was the master of the scene there.
This was the coldest I've ever been in my life.
Ever.
Ever.
Ever.
And you're going to write down the stats that go on the window tomorrow.
Marcus is gonna come by and pick up the photo for safekeeping.
Wait-Wait a second.
I am not going to repeat myself!
"The three of you are going to sit right there, just like that on the couch so I know you're behaving."
And you tell no one about this.
"We wouldn't want anyone messing with our little golden goose here, huh?"
"Now, would we?"
I want 50%.
(CHUCKLES)
You take a zero off that number.
That still makes you a very lucky man.
"Yeah, I feel real lucky."
We didn't agree to this.
"(SIGHS) You should have talked to us, man."
"I did my best, okay?"
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
But you'll soon find how little that counts for.
I'm not referring to myself.
But there's a lot of assholes out there.
"Less up here than in the city, but it's all relative."
You say it yourself.
I mean about your being so wonderful and still single and everything.
Who knows what he meant.
"Well, what's so funny?"
"Lottie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and at your age."
My age.
His age.
Same age.
"Give a little, take a little."
[Blanche laughing]
"Besides, who'd have him even if he asked me?"
That I'd like to see.
"Well, don't kill yourself laughing, Blanche."
"I may be a size 14, but I could get to be a size 10 for him."
"For a man like that, I could even get to be beautiful."
"For a man like that, a woman would do anything."
Just anything.
"Lottie, you didn't...."
Didn't what?
You didn't kill her?
What?
"Have some more cake, Mom."
"No, not for me."
I'm gonna start cutting down.
"You know, Janie, you wouldn't believe it."
"But when your father and me was married, I weighed only 98 pounds."
"He used to call me ""Peanut."""
Used to brag about my figure to everybody.
"In a nice way, of course."
Funny how a woman lets herself go when there's no man around.
"Well, those afternoon teas that you and Mrs. Armstedder indulge in... don't help either, Mom."
"You know, Janie, sometimes I think Blanche Armstedder isn't all there."
Only sometimes?
"Good night, Henry."
He's such a slut.
He's probably slept with half the girls on the campus already.
JACK:
"No, I haven't."
You know how much it costs me to fill up my truck?
A hundred bucks.
"Get a hybrid, man."
It's the only way to go.
"Uh, a little too girly for me."
"Oh, yeah, that's right, sorry."
It was a free car.
"My parents gave it to me, so..."
"It is a little girly, but I'd have to have a very good reason if I wanted to trade it in."
You got a family.
You need something bigger.
Amy's got a bigger car.
"Of course, it's orange."
Why did she pick orange?
"I don't know, some friend of her mother's gave it to her just to annoy her dad."
You both got free cars?
"Yeah, so no car payments."
"If we had car payments, we'd be in trouble."
"You got a scholarship, right?"
"Yeah, you got one too, right?"
Yeah.
"Yours is based on academics, but mine a depends on my game and the coach isn't too happy with me right now."
"Yeah, well, you gotta do what you gotta do."
I don't know.
"Grace, he was with Clementine before you guys were even back together."
He was with Clementine knowing we were going to get back together.
"All right, well, aren't you happy that you didn't have sex with him?"
"Sexually aware, but you just don't know it."
But when I read it...
You know what I mean?
"You're in denial of the fact that your parents had sex and everything and the second you pull that out, it was like,"
"""You bastard!"
"You know."""
"You know that he knows, because he swapped it for that."
"And you're lying there, in a foetal position."
My dick went backwards - I had a vagina.
"I'm lying on the bathroom floor, a new woman."
"I'd already undressed so I'm like, ""Oh, God, I've gone the whole hog!"""
"I went through the whole, like, opera of having a bath."
"You know, like..."
"# Just in the bath, la la la!"
#
"Singing too loud and kind of,"
# No wanking here Just enjoying the soap
# Nowhere near my testicles!
#
"And went downstairs and you know that thing of going, ""You know what?"
"""Maybe they played a trick."
"Maybe your brother..."""
I walked into the living room and I was just like...
"I felt so dirty but you're going,"
"""Just don't..."
"Play it cool, play it cool."""
Sat down.
And people think that...
This is genuine - Juliet Bravo was on.
I like Juliet Bravo.
I like Juliet Bravo.
Not in that way.
"Coming, coming!"
"For first time in 30 years, I let myself sleep as much as I want--"
- I know-- - ...and you have to come wake me up.
"I know, Axel, but something is wrong."
"Lisa, you forget Mr. Somers is boss now."
Call him in Long Beach--
"No, no."
"No, Axel."
He's the one who's making it wrong.
This morning I got a notice from him at the lumber yard.
He's canceling the regular monthly order for the shop.
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
"Axel, you didn't buy all these years from Carl just because he's my brother."
You bought because he handles the highest grade of S and F hardwood.
"Sure, sure, but if Mr. Somers wants to buy somewhere else, can I stop him?"
You want me to tell you why he cancelled out?
I'll tell you why.
Because he wants to buy cheap commercial grades of lumber.
Nothing but spruce and hemlock.
"Carl, if Somers did like you say, he will cheapen trademark."
He would make it nothing.
Why would he want to kill goose that lays the golden eggs?
That's crazy.
But Carl loses his biggest account.
What can we do?
[phone rings]
I will talk to you later.
And do not worry so much.
- There will be bigger things for all of us.
- [ring] [ring]
Hello.
"They say to him, ""What's the matter?"
"Don't you say anything?"""
"He says, ""What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"""
"So she says, ""Shut up!"
"You're always talking! """
"But in Italian, it sounds much nicer."
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy ever tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
I like this one...one dog goes one way and the other dog goes the other way.
"One's going east, and the other one's going west."
So what?
"And this guy's saying, ""What do you want from me?"" The guy's got a nice head of white hair."
Beautiful.
The dog looks the same.
Looks like somebody we know.
Without the beard?
"No, it's him."
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
"For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted."
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line.
"You got out of line, you got whacked."
Everybody knew the rules.
"But sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked."
Hits became a habit.
"Guys would get into arguements over nothing and before you knew it, one of them was dead."
They were shooting each other all the time.
They're based on the Dominicans who fought for La Independencia.
- Los Gavilleros?
- Yeah.
They fought the US with a guerilla waftare for four years.
"For me, it's just another way of talking about sugar."
"That's what the Gavilleros were fighting over-- foreign companies buying property from people who don't even own it, then kicking the campesinos off their land."
"Anyway, that's how I got the concept for ""Europa."""
Carlos...
I've got to be honest with you.
I really like what you did.
- Really?
- I love it!
"And it couldn't come in a more peftect time, because I just lost a series."
"The artist was brilliant, but he was terribly depressed and he could never work."
And I had to find something to fill the book in our slate.
- Okay!
- Great!
How soon can you finish?
- You never gonna believe it.
- What?
- You've got to guess.
- I don't know.
You won the lotto?
- I asked Daisy to marry me.
- Get the fuck outta here!
I asked her to marry me and she said yes.
I am high as a motheftucker right now.
"Dude, do you know what you're doing?"
Of course I know.
"I know I say shit sometimes, but that's just me being stupid."
"I'm getting fucking married, bro'."
"Yo-- all right then, well, shit!"
"I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge."
You should reflect on that.
"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces."
"If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines."
Got it.
Bye.
You know I'm right.
I think he's getting worse.
"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
- You okay?
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
Hadn't really thought about it.
Look.
"Uh, sure."
Very... prominent.
"Please, Leonard, don't leer, you have a girlfriend."
- Sorry.
"- So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
Yeah.
How did you know?
"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now."
Have a good night.
Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
"- Hey, you."
- Hi.
"Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
The lonely guy and the two happy couples?
"If they discover the secret of this cursed village, nothing will stop them from taking revenge."
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Let them come and see the captain!
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.
"Come on, then."
"Come on, ghosts."
"Come on, phantoms."
"Come on, demons."
Come back and see the captain.
I challenge you.
You died tonight.
I will kill you again!
We have to shut him up or he'll tell them everything.
He's drunk
I saw your heads smashed against the rocks!
What the hell is going on?
I don't want any trouble here
It's morning.
We're closing now.
Finish your drinks and go.
It happened one windy night
It happened one stormy night
"Crashed on the rocks, a stray ship"
Leaves two beautiful innocent girls
A celebration of beauty
Some accursed men were wandering about
Full of wine and alcohol
They plundered the wrecks at night
Innocence destroyed by rape
A celebration of beauty
This has to be in a good mood
"As long as this is OK, everything will be OK"
"Go, get rid of your problems and you'll be fine"
"OK, Pasha"
"Move it out, driver"
"What is it, sergeant?"
Mr Hatem is due down now
"- Good morning, Nabil"
"- Good morning, Mr Hatem"
"Good day, Hajj"
- come in for a second
- How's the market?
"We're at the end of this month, it's OK"
- But in general
"- In general, we're number one"
- and we have the highest sales
- May God bless
I wish you'd come in for a couple of minutes
I'll come down and drink tea with you another time
- Good bye
- Good bye
"No, I won't be able to come down"
"Why, Hajj?"
You're a blessing to us
"- Anyway, how's work?"
- Excellent
"May God bless, Tell everyone I said hi"
"- I will, Hajj..."
Good bye
"- Drive on, driver"
- I hope he's a good man
- In what sense?
"Okay,fine."
"You win, I will die, one day."
But...
"You win, I will die, one day."
But...
Why does it have to be today?
I'msorry.
Let me try to cheer you up.
"You know, I always go shopping"
Let me try to cheer you up.
"You know, I always go shopping when I'm down."
"You know, I always go shopping when I'm down."

Whatdoyouthink his last words were?
"Probably"" whoops,""or""ouch."""
his last words were?
"Probably"" whoops,""or""ouch."" The concept of ""last words"" is"
"Probably"" whoops,""or""ouch."" The concept of ""last words"" is as silly as the rest of this."
"The concept of ""last words"" is as silly as the rest of this."
"Wait,areyoutrying as silly as the rest of this."
"Wait,areyoutrying to ruin funerals?"
"Wait,areyoutrying to ruin funerals?"
This is how people grieve.
to ruin funerals?
Did you bring me here to stare at the lake?
"No, I brought you out here to understand why you're so angry with me."
"You know, you're at the age I was when my mother was really sick, right before she died."
Before she killed herself?
Yeah.
It happened right there.
I was 16.
I was so angry.
"I remember feeling like everything was always about her, you know, she was so consumed with her own life, her own misery, and Jess, I don't want you to ever have to feel that way."
I want you to know that you can come to me about anything whenever you want.
"Jess, I can tell you're in pain."
What's going on?
It's Naomi.
What do you mean?
We just have a complicated relationship.
I love her.
"Like, I mean, like, I'm in love with her."
"Or I thought I was, I don't know."
I thought she...
"She loved me too, but sh..."
"Oh, honey."
I'm sure she does love you in her own way.
"And if she doesn't, it's her loss."
"I mean, who could not love you?"
You're perfect.
I am?
"Jess, you're perfect in every way."
Why did you lie for her?
What do you mean?
"Naomi took the drugs, you know, the drugs you had in your shed for Casper?"
"She told me, she told me that you lied for her."
Why would you do that?
"Kitty, you are going out with a very dynamic man."
"Dynamic isn't some sort of code word for deranged, is it?"
"God, no."
"You told me you wanted handsome, and I went above and beyond on this one."
"Oh, absolutely beautiful."
"Well, why does she get to wear black?"
She's a woman of a certain age and it's classic.
- Earrings are wrong.
- What's wrong with pearls?
"Nothing, if you want to remind him of his grandmother."
Diamonds.
- Where are your diamonds?
- Is this too much?
That's the one.
And for the final touch?
A gift for both of you.
- Chicken cutlets?
- They're boobs.
They're boobs.
No.
I'm personally very happy with my body the way it is.
"Well, that's very progressive of you."
But you pay me to tell it like I see it.
I see you both need help in this department.
- What was wrong with Kleenex?
"- They're lumpy, and these?"
These are light and comfortable and they have just the right amount of jiggle.
"See, I'm wearing them right now."
Would you like to feel?
"- Oh, no, no."
I'm good.
"- No, thanks."
She got pregnant in '96'.
Who was she?
Where did she work?
She must have talked to someone.
I brought the plants in.
"If the room is too hot, they'll think it's spring."
- I'll call if we find anything.
"- Yes, OK."
"Let's hope for a period without frost, or we can't plant them until spring."
I've made some pumpkin soup.
You didn't see it.
Close it again.
The ultrasound images.
I'll heat the soup.
"No, I'm not up for soup, candles, and ultrasound images right now."
There's no need for you to get upset.
I'm only staying till tomorrow.
Did you speak to Mark?
Yes.
All he said was that he didn't know what to do.
I need to think about myself now...
and the baby.
"I'll move in with a friend, or move back to my parents."
That's likely to change when the baby comes.
- You have the ﬂat.
"- No, that won't be ready."
Someone stopped by to inspect the ceilings.
"They say there's asbestos, and that it'll all have to be torn down."
"Well, if you could handle being a single mum, I suppose I can as well."
I don't think I handled it particularly well.
I thought I could give Mark a...
"Well, I couldn't."
"Oh, about that we're not supposed to be brothers?"
"No, don't flatter yourself."
I don't break that easy.
"Oh, good, 'cause I was just being honest."
"Oh, yeah."
"No, I got that loud and clear."
"[ Telephones ringing, police radio chatter ]"
"Thanks for your patience, agents."
Coroner's report finally came in.
"All right, thank you."
"All right, let's see."
Did Wayne McNut really weigh 300 pounds just moments before time of death?
316 to be exact.
And the official cause of death?
Cardiac arrest.
"But between you and me, that's just a guess."
The vic suffered massive organ damage.
"Here you go, Jenny."
"Ruptured spleen, pierced liver, collapsed lung."
Looked like everything was just [slurps]
Sucked right out of him.
Like he'd been hoovered?
Yeah.
"Yeah, you know, I got to be honest, fellas -- hm?"
We're stumped.
This type of thing just doesn't happen in Stillwater.
"Now, did Wayne have any enemies?"
Hmm.
More like an unfriendly rivalry.
"A guy named ""Slim Jim"" Morgan."
"Like Wayne, he was pretty well-known in the competitive-eatin' circuit."
Competitive-eating circuit?
"Now, I liked Eddie and I want to help you, but you got to help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$ 10,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't..."
"- That's a lot of money, what've you got?"
- Who are you?
"Marybeth Cogan, Detectives Endowment Association."
I represent the Santos family.
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino so he could give up what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag but also to fill it with things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station because we are almost there.
"Oh, no!"
Wilbur.
"Hello, Bob."
We'd better do something fast.
Gretchen thinks there's a man in here.
It's Willy.
Willy?
Willy!
Willy?
Hello.
"Oh, it's the kid!"
"You two know one another, huh?"
"Sure, I'm his part-time uncle."
I bought him his train ticket.
But what's he doin' here?
"He wasn't feeling well last night, so I let him sleep here."
And Gretchen doesn't know he's a little boy.
She was in too big a hurry to spread the word.
I'll bet you that board meeting's goin' on right this minute.
"Well, I felt it was my duty to come to you, the board, and... and give you an insight into the private life of Nancy Collins."
It's the most outrageous conduct I've ever heard of.
"Miss Brendan, you say you actually saw this man in her, uh... drawing room?"
"Oh, yes, Professor Okell."
"And when I confronted her with it, she hit me with a tray."
(MEMBERS EXCLAIMING) This is outrageous.

I move that we vote for the dismissal of... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, Mrs. Brendan, but I had a train to meet."
We were just taking a vote on the dismissal of Nancy Collins.
"Good, I'll vote, no."
You'll what?
Don't you think Nancy should be allowed to testify on her own behalf?
"Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal."

Tell me who sent you!
It was Varrick.
"Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!"
I think this is our cue to exit.
Where do you think you're going?
It's a knockout!
They're falling back.
Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the north.
Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.
"I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming."
"Actually, someone did."
Remember Mako?
You've got a great officer on your hands.
He's one of the best.
Mwah!

Boyfriend?
"Wait, stop."

You really are as dumb as those rocks.
Of course we're a couple.
"Bolin, you saved the president."
And you proved Mako was right all along.
We have to go tell him what happened.
Yeah.
"Oh, you meant right now."

Sergeant Major Seo ended up going to his ex-girlfriend's wedding.
Together with Myeong Joo.
"If you're curious about what happened after, follow me."
Together?
Why did Yoon Myung Joo go?
What's wrong?
Congratulations on crashing your ex-girlfriend's wedding.
"Lucky for you, I'm also off duty."
Isn't that a relief?
I asked what was wrong.
Is my question hard to answer?
Is my answer hard?
If you keep on wrecking her wedding the Sergeant Seo way she'll probably be relieved for breaking up with you.
There's no way she'd regret it.
"But if you go with me, we can make her regret all night."
That was what my answer meant.
It's tempting.
But I have a condition.
"First, turn the rear mirror around."
She's an expert at breaking couples.
But what was the condition?
"From here, I appear."
The person that my father sees as husband material is coming in as a lieutenant.
My father said he was my upperclassman in the army.
He already came.
It's been two days since he came.
He came fast.
"Anyways, say that you're dating me."
You don't like Yoo Si Jin?
His appearance isn't my style.
He looks like a girl.
Cooperate?
"Charlie, we sleep ass to ass, you know that."
"Oh, great."
"Okay, clearly, we're having a problem with honesty here."
"Dennis, a word."
"I hate to say it, bro, but I think we're gonna have to do an overnight observation."
"Yeah, well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind seeing how this whole situation really works."
Fascinating.
"Well, this just gets weirder and weirder, man."
Anything?
Nothing.
False alarm.
"Damn it, dude, we can't keep doing this all night."
"Oh, I know."
You know what.
Why don't we sleep in shifts?
"Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying this isn't important work"
- but I can't keep my eyes open.
"- No, I hear you."
I hear you.
I hear you.
"All right, I'll tell you what."
You go ahead and go first.
I still got a little energy left.
"I don't know about this floor, Dennis."
It's covered in sand or something.
No.
"It smells like some kind of spice blend or pesticide, or some other kind of sandy poison or something."
I don't know.
"I wouldn't sleep on the floor, though."
- You got to sleep with them?
"- You got to, you got to."

Wow.

Maybe you make of the box derogatory?
No.
No.
But...for major lord... a lot may allow everything to himself.
"That, if i it would be done, and its news would be going in the village, and...well..."
"Do not speak more, dear Tót lord."
I totally understand.
You disdain this work and you ruin others' joy.
I am sorry that I was inconvenient for you.
I travel with the first coach tomorrow.

they pleaded to him.
"It was asserted, that misunderstands the situation."
"Since nothing happened, that could have hurt it."
"This may not be something else, only a terrible misunderstanding."
"One single of their desire,that let everything be put onto his mood."
"Let us forget the whole one, kind Tót."
"- Maybe, that the mistake is in me."
I don't think he'd done it for some time.
I discovered something under the micrcope.

The city is terrified over the Nam Mountain serial killings.
"Since the victims were prostitutes, the police suspect the same murderer, and have focused their inspection in the Nam Mountain area."

Exactly.
"Once they go through here, they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed."
So that's why we release them up here.
And we can just gently release this.
How extraordinary.Here they go!
And notice one thing - they're headed straight towards the brightest spot.
They are - straight for the sun.
That is the most incredible sight.
Fantastic.
Look at them!
Look at him!
They're desperate!
"There's no hanging around, they're not nervous about it - straight in the sea."
"Notice as soon as they float, they change their swimming pattern."
Just like a clockwork toy.
"Look, there's one last one up here - look, Stephen."
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Come on, you."
"Oh, no, the crab grabbed it as it went over the hole."

"That's it, go for it."

"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"- The last fifteen years, you said?"
- Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, make-up and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's make-up and her hair?
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
Ooh.
I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
"Well, they're people, and you're treating them like they're dolls."

It's fine.
I don't think that the office scuttlebutt was the only reason.

- Tell me about it.

What do you mean?
You got a memo announcing his visit a month ago.
"There it is, on the wall."
- Right.
"The same one that says that in six months we,d get a raise and be promoted to level B-4 and never work over 40 hours a week."
"Where,s that replacement crew you promised?"
"We,re here 24 hours a day."
Listen.
"We,II discuss your demands later."
AII I can say is the minister arrives in five minutes.
"You know, that's not gonna get your son back."
Quinn?
Is that his name?
It's not gonna get him back.
"And if you keep that up, you're gonna have two problems instead of one."
You know what he told me?
"He told me, ""I want my mama back."""
I want...
I want my son back.
"Well, um, Child Services won't let you live with Quinn again until you get treatment."
"And to get treatment, I need to prove PTSD."
- Post-traumatic stress...
- This is not combat-related.
"Hell, I got both my arms."
I didn't get my legs blown off.
I'm not in no damn wheelchair.
I know.
PTSD from military sexual trauma is just as real.
"Yeah, I know."
And it makes the military look bad.
What makes the military look bad is your senior officer raping you over and over again.
I don't want people looking at me like I'm crazy.
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.
I think I have some insight into that.
So you think you've seen what I've seen?
"No, but I've seen some pretty bad stuff."
I have seen thousands of spiders running up my best friend's face.
You wacked.
Yeah.
It's called schizophrenia.
So they sent me somebody crazier than I am.
"Yeah, that's right."
And the head of your family is Michael Corleone?
"Yeah, Counselor."
Michael Corleone.
Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone?
"No, I never talked to him."
"Mr. Cicci, could you amplify your answer a bit?"
-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?
"I'm particularly interested in knowing, was there always a buffer involved?"
Someone in between you and your superiors who gave the order.
"Right, a buffer."
The family had a lot of buffers!
"You may find this very amusing, but the members of this committee do not."
"Tell me something, Ma."
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?
He was being strong...
Strong for his family.
But by being strong for his family could he lose it?
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.
But you and your wife can always have another baby.
"No, I meant..."
lose his family
But you can never lose your family.
Times are changing.
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.
Take it as a gift.
"If there's something I can do for you, you come, we talk."
"Signora Colombo, why did you come to see me?"
I love New York.
"Doing a show here, man."
"You know, 'cause sometimes I do shows in weird places."
"Like, I just came back from Seattle, Washington."
That place is weird.
"'Cause Richard Sherman is there, and I'm scared of that guy, okay?"
"'Cause he's so forceful for no reason, right?"
"""Well, when you put me up against"
"""a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's what you gonna get!"""
"I said, ""Calm down."
"It's not that serious."""
"Ladies, let me tell you something."
"That's the type of dude, if he say you in a relationship, you's in a relationship."
There's nothing you can do about it.
"He walk right up to you, ""You coming with me."""
"You say, ""Bitch, I guess I'm going with him then."""
"""Fuck it."
"That's my baby now."""
"I'm serious, man."
"Oh, boy, it's so diverse in here."
I love it.
Ten Black people.
Thank y'all for coming.
It's--
"You aware that we are seriously a minority right now, and it's-- And it's cool."
"You know what, 'cause I love white folks."
"You gotta understand, I do."
"You know, 'cause when I first moved to New York,"
I moved into a dangerous neighborhood.
"And when I saw y'all walking around,"
I felt safe.
"'Cause I know when it all come down to it, y'all would get robbed before I will."
Never!
No?
Do you think I will put you out of your misery?
Wake up.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
Chosun Navy is the strongest navy there is.
"My comrades will chop off all of your heads, you wicked bastards!"
Long live Chosun!
Long live Chosun!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
All of us are sinners.
"In the past seven years, we've buried countless comrades of war at sea."
"If we failed to put an end to this war, if we fail to deliver justice for the pain and suffering of our people, we will forever be bound by our sins!"
"Today, we 16.000 soldiers of Chosun, go to war with faces of sinners."
"But tomorrow, we will return triumphant with faces of champions!"
"Do not let one single enemy ship, one single enemy soldier escape alive!"
Long Live Chosun!
Long Live Chosun!
"Yim Chun-su an Kim Bok-nam, you are under arrest!"
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything wrong!
Let go of me!
I'm not a criminal!
Let go!
Wait!
This is a mistake!
These men are innocent!
Step side!
No!
These men are innocent!
I just...
I don't think dinner tonight's a good idea.
"No, it's not a good idea at all."
I'm allergic to cats.
"Can we just, like, put them down until you're ready?"
"No, 'cause then they're likely to run away."
And then where are we?
Stuck with no cats.
Is everything OK?
What is this cat's name?
This little guy is called Prescott.
That was my grandfather's name.
"NARRATOR: 'For the first time in years, Ashley found herself feeling truly alone."
"'Despite being surrounded by people most of every day, 'she was unable to connect to them in a way she considered meaningful 'and found herself passing through their lives, and her own, 'in a state of total isolation."
What size are these shirts?
I don't know.
Small or medium.
Try it on.
I'll give you an ill-fitting discount.
They seem expensive.
Sold to the highest bidder.
- This too.
"- Yeah, why not?"
This?
Throw this in.
"It's not very good, but you can use it as a coaster or something."
No good.
Naw.
Take the jacket too.
Two for one.
Look at that.
"You would date that man, right?"
"Well, I think you will find that particular rumor to be false because Kentucky was invested."
She was the new face of Betty's Bees.
We designed our entire brand relaunch around her.
But Betty is the face of Betty's Bees.
"Oh, no, no."
"See, Betty..."
Betty's the old face.
"""Old"" being the operative word."
- She's 37.
"- She's 38, which rounds up to 40 which rounds up to 50, which rounds up to old."
"And if you are in the business of trying to sell a product that promises youth, beauty and vitality you have to make a strong case for it."
- Mm-hm.
Correction:
We have to make a strong case for it.
"Kitty, I would be honored if you called Betty's Bees your new home."
Betty's Bees is my new home.
Ah.
Stupendous.
"WOOLSEY Well, well..."
- Chuck has a new home.
I blame you.
I blame me too.
That went well.
"Emerson Cod's inside man  a.k.a. Betty's Bees ' newest Bee-Girl, Kitty Pimms  buzzed through the offices of Betty's Bees  until she buzzed upon the office of one Kentucky Fitz."
Chuck/Kitty searched for any hint of a saboteur's agenda.
What she found  was the eponymous Betty Bee.
What are you doing in there?
- Cognitive therapy for claustrophobia.
- You're Betty Bee.
- That's right.
Why am I explaining myself to you?
You should be explaining yourself to me.
That's true.
Mike and I got a lot of:
"""So, the music's really a character."""
"Yeah, the music's a fifth character."
New York's a character.
Yugo's a character.
Gum is a character.
"Yeah, the gum is a character."
"The Yugo's a character, you know."
"I'm not gonna lie, I felt important while this was happening."
"I was going in front of the line, doing what I want."
So we're going into one of my favorite scenes in the film.
"Mike and Kat, you did an amazing job with this dancing."
And I was worried about how we were gonna do this.
"Yeah, this was one of the most tired days of the shoot."
- Remember?
- This was when we switched to days.
- This was our first day.
- That's right.
We had been on the night schedule so we had not enough sleep.
I love your dance because it's so you two.
And only the two of you would do that.
"And only, I think, after hours of..."
"I mean, not being able to sleep for days."
You can tell we were desperate for sleep.
"Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about."
What am I saying?
I have a stomach ache from fatigue at this point.
"But when this was written, it was like ""Norah and Nick get up on Beefy Guy and Dev's shoulders and do a dance."""
- It was so terrifying.
- I didn't trust Rafi to hold me at all.
I didn't trust anyone to hold me.
"I made commitments,"
"I told her you would behave like an adult, and you do exactly the opposite."
"Wait, you're starting to piss me off."
- I'm telling you it's not my fault.
"- Right, you're a victim."
"If you want to be helped, you need to change your tune!"
What is this fucking lecture?
"You pretend to be nice, but you're an arsehole like the rest of them!"
Take back what you just said.
It's not my fault trouble follows me around!
My life sucks and it won't change.
Only my mother understood me.
Even when she was wasted she understood me.
"You know, Dylan is one of these helpless teenagers."
"He's nice, and the next minute he messes up."
"It's true, I misjudged him."
I heard he came to talk to me.
The other two went after him when he meant no harm.
See if the judge can move him to another home.
No one can stand him here.
That's the paradox for these kids.
They need attention and all they get is hate.
I'll call the judge.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Mr Zeppini.
"I was freed an hour ago, so I came to thank you."
May I?
- Please.
A client who thanks me is a rare thing.
That how I am.
When I'm happy I let people know.
With the wedding chapel on it.
Would you guys find it!
"I love you, Roger."
"I love you, Babs."
Barbara!
You creep!
Babs!
Coach!
Enough!
"Ah, Magnum."
There you are.
"You realize, of course, you have no chance of winning."
"Well, Buddy's not saying a word."
Catching him with a gun is enough.
The guy's a three-time loser.
You know they're gonna put him away for life... probably 300 years.
"And the money, they still haven't found it?"
Roger didn't exactly give them a pinpoint location.
They're liable to be digging up that place till the next Iron Man race.
He seemed sure it was in the Bougainvillea Priscilla.
They'll find it.
And then we'll get married and go back to Bayonne.
"And I'll open an exercise school, and he'll open a little tropical flower shop."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
And everybody will come out of this pile of bat guano smelling like a rose except me.
"Just think, man, I'm the one that put up the money to sponsor you."
"You forget, Robin Masters made a sizable contribution without expecting any publicity for it."
Robin?
What about me?
"I put up the food, the booze, the potato chips."
"Stop it, all of you."
Tom did his best.
"Alright, see ya."
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
"Hey, um..."
"Hey, um..."
"Do you take money, Malcolm?"
"Do you take money, Malcolm?"
"Like, if I got a warrant to access your bank accounts,"
"Like, if I got a warrant to access your bank accounts, what would I find?"
what would I find?
"Come on, mate."
"Come on, mate."
It's no accident
It's no accident the cannabis industry around here's out of control.
the cannabis industry around here's out of control.
You've been looking the other way for a long time now.
You've been looking the other way for a long time now.
It's not just you.
I know that.
It's not just you.
I know that.
"Even this bloody building's got a smell about it, hasn't it?"
"Even this bloody building's got a smell about it, hasn't it?"
Dry rot.
Dry rot.
And garlic.
And garlic.
"Listen, mate, if you tell me the whole story,"
"Listen, mate, if you tell me the whole story,"
I will move heaven and earth to protect you.
I will move heaven and earth to protect you.
"If you're thinking of turning this into some kind of witch-hunt,"
"I don't know, I'm sort of in a holding pattern."
My purity pledge group is playing biojeopardy tonight
There's free refreshment and girls.
There was a girl one time.
"I think it was a girl, I'm almost positive."
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- The circus is in town...
"Last time, I won the entire Rascal Flatt's catalog"
- on CD.
"- If you wanna hang out with your KT brothers, I completely understand."
Why don't you hang out with my Kappa Tau brothers forever?
- That sounds harmless.
"- No I'm serious, you can pledge KT."
"You're still technicly just a pledge at Omega Chi, why wait around for them?"
There's been a couple days and no notice.
We'd have so much fun together.
Let me think about it.
OK but what are we doing tonight?
"You know what, this guy in my dorm mentioned something about a '70s party"
Normaly I pull these things off but it could be fun.
The Carpenters are one the greatest most underated duos of all time.
Do you wanna join us?
It's like I'm living ever.
I bet the party money went towards the disco bar.
I think I'm gonna swing by Kappa Tau tomorrow.
"Episode 1x12 ""The great Cappie"""
Transcript:
"Kasius, Allysiah, HorcKs, AkaZab,"
Here you are.
I guess we should talk strategy.
"You, don't worry."
"This afternoon, I'm gonna pick up a ton of copies of TGG."
Suppose you leave your house all open won't it drive the thiefs bad intentions on?
"Ty telling this to people, and they get furious."
Weird talks!
You thinks people ale...
Come on!
Both ofyou have really got deep into it.
Go ahead.
Throw your questions at me.
"Else, how will you gain knowledge on this subject."
"Hey Vijay, you are here?"
You are wanted there.
Me?
-Eveyone is requesting you to sing.
Are you kidding?
A song?
From a police officer?
- You'll be amazed to hear him.
How will he sing in an orchestra?
He might need a police-band.
Come on!
Don't hesitate.
- We are getting late.
"""There was this extremely beautiful young girl..."""
"""walking down the lane, all alone"""
"""She wore clothes, only because she had to dress in something"""
"""She looked as exotic as the sculptures ofthe Ajanta Ellora"""
"""And there came this young man who bumped into her"""
"""You decide this, my friends..."""
"""whose mistake is it?"
"Whom are we to punish?"""
"""You decide this, my friends..."""
"""whose mistake is it?"
"No, Chef, don't say that, please!"
I cannot take
Much more!
"Now, these hopefuls are ready to enter"
Chef Ramsay's domain.
They come with confidence.
I'm not nervous at all about any competition.
"Throw a pan at me, and I'm gonna throw a pan back."
And they come with dreams of being the next winner of Hell's Kitchen.
It's done;
it's over with.
They might as well just give me the prize.
"Today, representatives from the media have come for their first glimpse of the group that will contain the next culinary superstar."
"It's not that I'm cocky, but"
Hell's Kitchen's gonna be a piece of cake.
These aspiring chefs think they know what awaits them.
I'm pretty confident that
I'm prepared for anything that Chef Ramsay can throw at me.
But no one is ever really prepared for Hell's Kitchen.
"Right, let's go."
Come over.
"Oh, my God."
I was taken away.
I felt like a celebrity.
"Hello, hi."
This year's chefs come from all over the country.
"I'm from Maui, Hawaii."
"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
"Boston, Massachusetts."
"From many different culinary backgrounds,"
I'm a master cook.
I'm a culinary arts teacher.
Because I don't want to be rude when you show up to my house unannounced.
"Like, like right now."
And you're like a tiger.
"And... you throw yourself at me, and I don't have someone to blame right now... but you're the best I can come up with on the fly."
Why aren't you with Dale?
"You're not the typical Hollywood guy, and she needs someone real like that."
"Look, I really don't know what to say to that."
Dale made it pretty clear that she's not interested in me.
You guys just have something between you two.
I've seen guys come in and out of her life.
But I've never seen her be as comfortable and happy as she is when she's with you.
"Whatever she's going through please don't give up on her, Zach."
Just let her work it out.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I never meant to do that.
You didn't.
I hurt myself.
I just gotta open my eyes a little wider next time.
"Can we maybe um, hang out just like be friends and stuff?"
"Yeah, I don't see why not."
That'd be good.
Ok.
Good night.
Can we hang out right now maybe?
I don't think that would be a very good idea.
Maybe I can just come in.
Not good.
Right.
Yeah.
"No, no, no, no."
You don't understand.
She wants yellow roses.
You will see her in time.
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine."
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
"I saw him once from a distance, though."
Handsome boy.
"He's got a long struggle ahead of him, that's for sure."
"Doctors, rehab... physical therapy...."
I think I'm going to have the medallions of veal.
You make me late for a table at Tavern on the fucking Green?
How's the real estate business?
-Excuse me?
"-You know, HUD."
"Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman."
Zellman tell you this?
Carmine doesn't know anything about this yet.
"I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal, make it right."
"Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you in out of friendship, but that's over."
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.
You sure you want to go down this road?
"How much to paint a different suit on him, change his face a little?"
-Pardon me?
-Why throw it away?
"A stronger chin, maybe."
I was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse.
"Something classy, you know, like a Revolutionary War general."
Napoleon and his horse.
That kind of thing.
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.
"Not Napoleon, exactly."
Like Napoleon.
Sit down.
Relax.
"What's going on, Ton'?"
"I think I know what happened to Ralph, and if I'm right... he ain't coming back."
Please keep that in mind
Yes... sorry
Don't sit there
I forbid you from being in my sight
"Excuse me, but..."
Why did you choose such a nice room?
Are you asking me?
Yes
Um...
Were you showing off or something?
That wasn't my intent
Satsuki said she liked this room
"Yep, I like it"
"Sorry, it's just me showing off"
It's not Satsuki's fault
"Mr. Aida, you're so nice"
You think so?
Bebi!
Do you grasp the situation you are in?
I wanted to be your friend but this is horrible
Sorry...
You betrayed us
You said you would come right out
Sorry
Appologizing doesn't solve anything
She is my close friend
"You understood the situation, right?"
"Lin, stop it"
Yelling at Bebi doesn't solve anything
Unless it's going to lead you guys to bed
Lin topping and Mr. Aida bottoming
That's so kinky
We need to show them an example.
An example?
"Yes, and we don't need many."
One should be enough.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
"Sir, you have to leave us with something to live on before you collect the tax."
Please don't be so cruel.
"Boy, there's not getting through to you!"
So what are you saying?
Are you not going to pay your taxes?
"We would if we could, but we can't afford to."
Don't you realize tax evasion is a serious crime?
Don't waste my time!
Please!
What are you waiting for?
Take the salt and load it up!
No!
You might as well be telling us to die!
Step aside?
"No, you'll have to kill me first?"
How are you interfere with government business!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!
"No, Father?"
Or they'll take you to.
Father!
Father!
Father!
"Chun-su's, Father?"
"What do you mean, Mother?"
"I don't know why, but I'm told they were arrested and badly punished by the officials."
It looked like he was unconscious when I saw him.
Funny.
"Right here, at the Del Rio, $50 is a cheap evening."
"And over here, it's a lot of laundry."
I never get used to New York.
"I don't know why not, it got used to you."
"Darling, since you're the one who did the walking out, why should you be so unfriendly?"
-I don't like revivals.
-And what makes you think this is one?
"We knew each other very well, for a very long time."
"I've been away, and now I'm back."
"Is it so odd that I should want to know how you are, and what you're doing?"
-And that's all?
-And that's all.
Fine.
"I've been working hard, doing nicely, and I'm happy in my marriage."
-She forgave you?
-She forgave me.
And you've been on the wagon since I left.
"If you mean have I been faithful to my wife, yes, I have."
And I don't find it very difficult.
I've always loved my wife.
That shouldn't be news to you.
"Of course, you met me after you were married."
"But then, maybe that wasn't love."
"Whatever it was, it's over."
Maybe it wasn't love.
"Maybe it was only chemistry, or the right combination, or a miracle."
But most people drag through their whole lives without finding it.
"We both know that, don't we, Bran?"
You'd better get back to your Mr. Dawning.
Alec Dawning has other things to offer.
"All that nice, new, shiny money, huh?"
Watch the hands.
The hands tell you everything.
"I stand corrected, and... disturbed."
Okay... what about our cranky friend over there?
"Sum him up for us, Tony."
Cranky car salesman.
Lonely childhood.
Behind on his quota.
Regretting his life choices.
Not a couple.
And not familiar to either of you?
"Geez, Ellie, let it go."
"I'm trying, but..."
he's right there.
"You know, Tony, I don't mean to pin this on NCIS, but Ellie became much more suspicious about people since she joined you guys."
That is so not true.
"Oh, you really like talking bad guys."
"Well, I have to talk about something, since we can't talk shop anymore."
"When we were both at NSA, we'd debrief every night after work-- but now that he's restricted from telling me anything, all I can do is talk about what we do every day."
Chase bad guys.
"So I get where I may seem more suspicious, but..."
I'm not.
"Hey, why don't I get us some coffee."
"Well, there's Dirk, if it's a boy, obviously, or Oskar, with a ""K."""
Oskar Palmer-- that's a lot of R's.
Hmm.
"If it's a girl, we're thinking, uh,"
"Freda, Greta, Liesel-- something sort of Von Trapp-ish."
"Come on, McGee, up and at 'em."
Workday's over.
We're talking baby names and snow angels.
Can't right now.
"- Of course, I knew her well."
Killed in the rearguard action at Gedden.
"I knew she was reported dead, sir."
I never heard any details.
There was a great deal of confusion when the High Council were restored to power.
Most of the old guard were killed in the fighting.
They remained loyal to Servalan right till the end.
"And a lot were executed later, weren't they?"
- All the leaders were purged.
- The penalty for choosing the wrong side.
I myself was under arrest for a short time.
"Well, I suppose it's better to die bravely in the field than to face execution later."
PA SYSTEM:
"Attention, citizens."
Attention.
This is a census call.
Assemble in the concourse now.
Use entrances 1 and 3 only.
"I repeat, entrances 1 and 3 only."
Let's try over there.
- Ah.
Any ideas?
- We'll have to go through him.
"That's what they're expecting, friends."
Follow me.
If you want to stay alive.
We'll lie low till the check is over.
- DAYNA:
What's the check for?
- Catching people like us.
The unadapted.
- Unadapted?
Maybe you're right.
Ice cream and bowling.
Let's go!
Miley.
"I'm sorry, maybe you can deal with this but..."
Please don't say it.
...I can't.
So you're just gonna walk away from us?
"As long as there's two of you I don't think there can be an ""us""."
[Sighs]
You know dad I really thought that Jesse was different.
I thought he could handle all this.
Ah you just gotta give the boy some time Mile.
"If he really loves you, he'll be back."
"If he really loves that pretty boy face of his, he won't be."
Daddy.
Oh I'm sorry honey.
I just hate seeing you this hurt.
Truth is whether you're ready to hear it or not if he comes back that's great.
"And if he doesn't, there'll be other boys."
I keep praying there won't be but there always are.
I don't know.
Maybe I should just give up guys for good.
Oh now you're just teasing me.
Honey the truth is life has a funny way of working things out.
"One door closes, another one opens."
All you've got to be ready to tell yourself is...
[Screaming excitedly]
When your daughter asks if her best friend can live with you.
Think about it for more than a second.
[Continues screaming]
And then say no.
We?
He isn't pissed at us.
You're the government agent.
He probably thinks we're all agents.
He believes almost everyone is.
- I'm not with any government agent.
- He's trying to confuse you.
I'm with you.
"Big Brother, right?"
"Newthink, newspeak?"
"Hate is love, war is peace."
He's laughing at you.
- Stop it!
"- No, Ted."
It's okay.
- He doesn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, chill."
I support you.
Screw the government.
Make him sit down.
"All right, how do we remove a microchip that's not there?"
His speech is lucid.
"There's no sign of neologisms, word salad or loosening of associations."
"As long as he can systematize, he'll be able to keep his thinking relatively organized."
Organized enough to see through any game we try to throw at him?
"And if he's convinced it's in his arm, and not in a place like his lower back or his neck..."
An incision means he's going to be watching.
Maybe we can just convince him that he's been looking in the wrong place.
Or we could fake it.
Conceal a chip in the palm.
A little sleight of hand.
"Come on, Reid, what are you talking about?"
"Isn't that right, Mr. Rafet?"
Sure.
The one who gives less...
We'll talk about that later.
I will prepare your house for you with pictures that just left.
"Excuse me, I'll be back soon."
"Bro, I have some good news for you and some bad news."
The bad news is that Rafet's here.
Good news is that Professor Candan's on his lap
What lap?
Don't exaggerate guys.
"Of course, we might say that it's bad news for you."
What's she doing on his lap?
Mr. Rafet was giving her something but we came in at that moment.
I thought I'd ask you about what to do with these lovebirds.
There's nothing going on.
Decision made.
She's dead for me now.
She's got no taste at all.
He's very depressed.
He's very angry...
And his grandfather is from the tribe...
What happened?
What do you want?
Tell me.
All you have to do is give me the answer keys of all the remaining test exams.
"That's one... if this matter leaves this room, I'll make sure the record you... die for goes public."
And that's two.
Have some water.
"Come on, son."
"If anything goes wrong, I know you and you know me."
- Don't get anyone else involved.
Hmm?
Do you hate your job or what?
No.
The only job I ever hated was that horrible job as a bag boy at the supermarket.
I'm certainly glad I had the sense to get out of that after about a day.
"You've been listening, haven't you?"
Voices carry.
"Seriously, George, I mean, you've been a teacher all your life."
Do you still enjoy getting up in the morning?
"Oh, Alan..."
"It would be very easy for me to tell you that I have dedicated the last 38 years to several thousand young minds, and that is my chief joy and reason for getting up in the morning."
Except it isn't.
I teach because I like it.
And because it's fun for me.
"Ah, but when it stops being fun?"
"Well, then I suppose I would look to my family and friends for support to help me find something new."
"Well, thank you, George."
You've taught me something.
And it was fun for me.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
"I mean, who would possibly stop and pick me up in the middle of rural Pennsylvania?"
Whoa!
"Young friend, how far art thou traveling?"
Me?
"Yes, thee."
"Uh, well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I'm going as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
That farmhouse there?
Yes.
That farmhouse there.
I see.
- And a little bird-watching as well.
If you're lucky.
Best keep to the far side of the canal.
Restricted area this side.
- Really?
- Starts half a mile from here.
"The man, codename: the Needle."
Also known as Henry Faber.
"He was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called Öln in West Prussia."
At the age of 13 he went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden.
"Two years later, he was transferred to the more prestigious Groß-Lichterfelde near Berlin."
"He already spoke fluent English because his father, Baron von Müller-Guder, had worked in Washington as a military attaché, and had sent his son to private school there."
"But back in Germany, the boy rebelled constantly and was often flogged for it."
He passed his final exams with extremely high marks.
"In the '20s, the Needle was a cadet at the war school in Metz, and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him."
"In '31, Hitler visited the family estate and met him."
"In '33, Hitler came to power."
The Needle was made a captain and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties.
He had an affair with a German actress.
He never married.
He made no close friends.
"And in '38, the Needle disappeared."
God.
Clever bastards.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- And who might you be?
- I should be asking who you are.
You're on my boat.
- What's in that bag?
"- Binoculars, camera, reference books."
"No, you don't."
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. Was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
"-Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP."
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Even a tiny bleed can become serious if she can't clot.
"It's possibly a good idea, Dr. Kovac..."
... butyoudo realizethatbloodproducts carry the risk of infection...
"... andtransfusionreaction,don 'tyou ?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, was the CT negative?"
There's no bleed that we could see.
Do you wanna expose your patient to those risks because her platelets are low?
Scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.
I'd worry more if she had mental status changes...
... ora focalneuroexam.
-He's got a point.
-She's drunk so that's hard to assess.
Drunk people get sober.
And careful observation is still better than any lab.
That's right. I'd have to agree.
What just happened?
They've been pulling that on me all morning.
"I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest?"
-l wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
-Did you hear what I said?
-They got you on tape.
-Couldn't have been me.
-You were up there long enough.
-They had to look for that infuser thing.
"Don't give me that crap, K.J."
Okay.
"There's this girl, one of the volunteers..."
-... she'sfineas hell-- -l went out on a limb for you.
"For Foon's sake, don't offend him, OK?"
But that's the fact!
Sorry!
...
Summon the witness.
I was washing rice inside the kitchen.
"When I heard the gun shot, I rushed to the backyard at once."
What did you see?
"I saw Ho Chun lying on the ground, with blood all over his body."
Foon pointed a gun at him and laughed.
"He said, ""Ho Chun, you are dead meat now."""
What's next?
I was afraid and screamed!
Ho Foon got mad and chased after us.
Objection!
What did you say?
What you've just said differs from the statement you gave to the police.
I just want to ask why you amended your statement?
"Objection substained, witness should answer the question."
I worry that Ho Foon will avenge me.
So I didn't tell all the truth.
"I have no question, it's your turn."
"I would like to show the jury the evidence, item number one first."
"Witness, this gun can shoot only one bullet."
"You said you heard the gun shot, so how could he shoot you again?"
He didn't want to kill me with gun.
But by what?
Sword.
Are you kidding me?
Really?
"He chased after me and wanted to kill me with ""capital chopper""."
"He chased after me, and I was so afraid..."
It's Eskimo or something.
BELL:
All clear!
No one's home.
It's freezing in here.
Is there a window open somewhere?
"Yeah, in the bedroom."
Otolik's an Inuit name.
The address he registered with the front desk is well north of the Arctic Circle.
So you can imagine he likes things a little chilly.
"His companion, on the other hand, might've preferred things a bit warmer."
His companion?
"Yeah, long brown hair."
Looks like Tendu spent the night in someone's warm embrace.
Before they went out the window.
Hand and shoe prints.
HOLMES:
Male and female.
So I find people rarely exit rooms via windows when they're not fleeing for their lives.
"Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer paid them a visit, too."
That's one possibility.
The other is that they were worried that someone would catch them with this.
Looks like the murder weapon.
BELL:
"If that's a garden tool, it's not like one I've ever seen."
That is a hakapik.
(camera clicks)
It's a seal-killing club favored by the Inuits.
"Judging by this inscription, it is a going-away present, a little memento from home."
This hook matches O.G.'s head wounds.
I'm gonna put out a Finest Message.
Looks like we got a suspect.
"- Das, you know me well right?"
"- Yes, I do."
But they say the house is too big.
Can I make it smaller?
"If it is too big, check whether they could share it.Let them share the rent."
- OK
- What happened?
"- The big mouth won't reduce the rent, it seems."
"Since the girl too feels the house is too big, you both could share the rent."
Is she OK with it?
Paramasivam is checking that.
"If it is OK with her, would you agree?"
"- I agree, but she musn't not be lawyer."
"- She won't be lawyer, don't worry man."
"If he agrees, I don't mind."
"- Hey, Paramasivam, my client has agreed."
- Madam has agreed too.
- Then give 1 lakh as advance.
Why does he give expression as if it is a register marriage?
Would he ask for a garland too?
- I'll take that room.
"- OK, I'll take the other one."
"- Hey Paramasivam, are you riding the pillion?"
- yes.
- The hot seat might blister your piles.
"- As if he is my doctor, go to hell."
-You would be watching her all the time from tomorrow onwards.
Start the bike
"- Her dress is lovely, isn't it?"
- Shall I borrow it for you to wear?
"- If both of us are in the same profession, it would be a hassle."
Let's avoid that.
' This is what you did.
That's because...
I was shocked.
I didn't even really get to see anything.
Oh my God!
So... you and this guy...
haven't seen each other yet?
How can you be like that when you guys are getting married in a month?
Is that...
something a kid should be saying right now?
Just go and pack up some more stuff.
Teacher Gil...
You want me to show you?
My body is really rocking right now.
Look.
This...
Isn't a body you can get in a month or two.
-Look.
This guy's abs are like chocolate!
-Don't do it!
It's nice.
I wonder why this guy hasn't shown you his body that he's worked on?
"I thought since he took such good care of it, I thought it was to look good for you..."
Yoon Jae...
Likes to work out because he likes to keep himself busy.
That's right.
"I'm sure at the very least, he was diligent about working out every day for at least 2 hours."
"To be in that shape, do you really have to work out every day for at least 2 hours?"
Unconditionally.
He should've seen you more during those hours.
He must have given you excuses to take those hours to work out.
I guess to this guy...
For instance?
"You'll need a second in command for that special stunt, Sir."
"Young man, ""stunt"" is a word I do not like."
Not when applied to a military operation.
"Slip of the tongue, Sir."
The Chief Instructor said he put a word in.
He did.
"It's a word I wouldn't care to use, but we'll see."
"A falling object descends earthwards at the rate of 32 feet a second, accelerating to the maximum speed of 176 feet a second."
That's what I call descending.
"You'll be all right, Alf."
As long as you land on that big head of yours.
"Green light on, action stations, Number One, and er..."
Hold it!
"What, may I ask, are you doing up there?"
Practising.
"If you want to be polite to a regimental sergeant major, you address him as ""Sir""."
"Practising, Sir."
Get down from there before I take you to the guard room!
Two volunteers to put him on his bed.
You and you.
At the double!
"Ooh, my leg."
So you're what they're turning out as soldiers these days.
I wanted to see for myself.
Mm.
Mm-hm!
A horrible lot of little men.
Thank God we've still got a navy.
Let's take a look.
... I'll kick him in the...
"First balloon jump 0600 hours, tomorrow."
"So far, so good."
I have been directed to address you... on the possibility of making the army your career.
- [Muffled Whimper] - [Laughing] - [Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
"[Charles, Laughing] Army..."
Career...
I'm sorry.
"If I held that in, my teeth would've exploded."
- You gotta be kidding.
"- Gentlemen, please, it's impolite to laugh at the senile."
- What'd he say?
- Loss of hearing is the first sign.
Will you clowns keep quiet!
Some of us are interested in what Col. Potter has to say.
"Go on, Colonel."
"- Why, thank you, Major."
- [Kissing Noise]
"You blow one more kiss, Pierce, and those lips will never walk again."
Please.
I'd like to hear this too.
- [Making Kissing Noises]
- Oh!
Blow it out your bugle!
"- Colonel, please continue."
"- Gracias, Padre."
"Now, I think you'll admit... the army presents unique opportunities... that can't be had anywhere else."
That's very true.
What other job lets you die for a living?
Certainly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The army provides a chance to see the world.
Scenic tours of all the great battlefields.
- It provides a home.
"Oh, okay, fine!"
"Well, then why don't we wait closer to the exit?"
"Because if it looks like we planned our escape, they'll know it was a setup, and Mike dies."
W-what if we die?
!
"I mean, has anyone thought about that?"
!
"Yes, which is why you need to stop talking!"
"Just get ready, 'cause at any moment, they're gonna show --"
They're in the warehouse!
"Schmidt, get out here!"
They caught us by surprise!
Can we leave now?
!
"Dude, if we're gonna sell this, you got to put up a fight, okay?"
Which means you need to shoot at them.
Shoot at them with your gun!
"Yeah, I think they bought it."
There's too many of them!
Let's get out of here!
"Go, go!"
"Spies will use whatever they can to get behind enemy lines -- stealth, deception, and even capture."
"A prisoner of war can learn about enemy morale, supply, and location."
"Of course, the first thing you have to do is convince your enemies you're worth more alive than dead."
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.
Hey!
Someone's here!
What is this?
Who are you?
!
"- Yeah, you did."
On the inside.
What are you trying to say?
"Oh, that I love you, and that I want you to live forever."
Love you too.
"One more kiss, and make it a good one."

"We have been ordered to hand over Carlos Mejia to the FBI because somehow Mexico has found out we have him,"
- and now they want him back.
- So we're just gonna hand him over?
"Wait a minute, how the hell did they find out we have him?"
- I don't know yet.
"- Did anyone else know,"
- apart from us?
"- No, no."
They did not.
So we've been compromised.
Our security's been breached.
That's a possibility we have to consider.
"- Yes, absolutely."
- We can't let this happen.
"What do you suggest we do, pop a nine-mil in the back of Mejia's head while we still got him?"
"Oh, I know, how about we just send Mexico some more American jobs instead?"
What if the cartel are behind this?
- Pulling the strings...
- Of the Mexican Government?
- You don't think that's possible?
- This is natural.
A projection.
Your mind fights against itself as it attempts to expunge the pain and grief you carry inside.
You have internalized society's rules and limits.
"In order for you to achieve your desires, we must first strip away the guilt and shame and outdated mores that have taken residency within your very flesh and bones."

Hello.
Are you visiting someone?
"- Uh, yes, my sister Isabel."
She's convalescing.
- Yes.
"Well, good day, Roderick."
Great to see you.
"Come, my love."
- Is this your daughter?
"- No, this is my wife, Mrs. Baxter."
You haven't met?
They'll arrest you if you don't.
Arrest me?
"Why, he's the thief."
Don't say things like that.
These people are police.
You'll make them angry.
"You keep out of this, Wooster."
"Come, Miss Lowman."
I happen to know that you arranged to meet McDermott here... and turn over the rest of the plans to him.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- And I also know... that McDermott arranged to turn over his plans to the Faulkner Aircraft company.
"Oh, really?"
That's quite near here.
Just go down the road.
- Thank you very much for the information.
"- Oh, no charge, old boy."
"- So, you see, your pretense won't work, Miss Lowman."
- You might as well confess.
- Are you going to give them up or must we take them?
- I've said all I'm going to.
Very well then.
Go on.
Search her.
I can't allow you to manhandle the lady.
"- Sit down, jack-in-the-box."
"- I've had just about enough of you, Mr. Wooster."
This isn't cricket.
"If you want to search, have a matron here."
Search me.
"Wooster, if you interfere again, it'll be for last time."
"Here, take this."
"Very touchy on this ""blowpipe"" question."
He heard me.
"Given the circumstances, for insurance and safety reasons,"
I think it's better to handle his moves.
"Ludovic, let him drive."
I do not want interferences from the waiter.
- Ludovic.
The clutch does not work well.
"Do not stay in the first place, sire."

How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
I would kick them in the arse!
"Look, I'm not intrerested in politics."

Good afternoon.How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Pidlivization?
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial pidlivization?
Civilization.
It depends on where they came from.
Good afternoon.
But I've always been a little sensitive about it.
You understand?
"Oh, I certainly do, sir."
"Lou, Lou, I'm talking, but you're not listening."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) There's no money in the budget.
"Lou, will you believe me?"
There's no money.
"Look, that's the way it is, take it or leave it."
Good.
Good.
You got yourself a deal.
"What is it this time, Lieutenant?"
I'm a very busy man.
"There was no one out there, sir."
It's all right.
So I just came in.
Congratulations.
Congratulations for what?
I heard you came into a lot of money.
I see.
You heard about my little windfall?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Lieutenant, if you think I knew anything about this, you're wrong."
My lawyer called me and told me my wife's safe deposit box was practically layered with receipts for these silver certificates.
I'll be damned if I can figure out how she did it.
"I think the government's gonna have a little trouble, too, because she never declared them as income."
She kept the certificates in a numbered account in a Canadian bank.
"And it all goes to you, right, sir?"
And it all goes to me.
After taxes.
Including a few lovely IOUs from Ward Fowler.
"Is that so, sir?"
- It's good to get out.
It was hot.
- I didn't notice it but I suppose I would if I'd been drinking as many beers as you have.
Thanks for reminding me.
Let's get some.
- Why don't you have an ice cream soda?
"- Oh, no."
Do you have to wake up with a hangover?
- Come on.
Let's go into Nick's.
- All right.
"Well, kids, how do you like the moving picture tonight?"
- It was grand.
"- Kind of sappy, if you ask me."
Sure.
Too much love stuff.
Is not for me.
"I like the racketeer pictures, boy."
"You know, shoot them up."
Is more excitement as love.
"Why, Nick, where's the romance in your soul?"
"Where is the what, please?"
Romance.
"You know, two people falling in love and sitting in the moonlight gazing into each other's eyes."
"Well, I like this too but I like better to do it myself, personal than to see some guy in the movies do it."
"Huh, kid?"
I don't care what they say.
I think that love story was beautiful tonight.
It's a lot of bunk.
No real man would ever propose like that.
"- Oh, they don't."
- You don't have to look at a girl and tell her eyes are like the twinkling stars.
"Here's what happens, right?"
It's a sexually aggressive badger?
Locks on your leg.
"I'm sure other people have heard this, that you have to carry..."
"Never heard about it before in my life, mate."
Should have backed me up on the fucking film.
Did you find it?
Did you find it?
I've seen badgers.
They never locked on me.
I never smelt like a...
They never smelt me like a competitor.
"The badger will only release when it hears the crack of bone, so you have to carry a stick and if the..."
Is that a real thing?
Yes.
Only when your bone cracks will it let you go?
Look...
They're only about that big.
They can't do that.
"No, they're huge."
You either heard this somewhere...
Or dreamt it.
Or dreamt it.
Would you like me to put you out of your misery?
"The director has come into my ear and said Honkytonk Man was released in 1982, starring Clint Eastwood."
APPLAUSE
"I'm sorry, Johnny."
"He told me that about five minutes ago, but it was much more fun..."
"The period of time where you were going,"
"""Is there nobody here?"
"!"" was more fun."
Carrying a stick.
- Was I with anybody?
"- Uh, no."
Did I talk to anybody?
Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?
No.
"You, uh, just ate, and then you left."
"Uh, gave me your watch first."
Do you still have the watch?
Best wingman I ever had.
That does not look familiar.
And it's a knock-off.
But it's the freshest clue we have.
I'll buy it back from you.
Sure.
My brother was right.
Right about what?
The Phantom.
A serial killer Phillip was hunting.
He stumbled onto it working a missing-persons case.
We haven't heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.
That's why Phillip called him The Phantom...
Because no one has any idea that he exists.
"According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years."
A bicoastal serial killer?
"Right before Phillip flew back to L.A., he told me that he'd had a break in the case, that he was close to identifying The Phantom."
He must have gotten too close to the truth.
I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom's alleged victims.
Total of seven...
"Four in L.A., three in New York."
All seven were killed with a knife.
Any pattern besides the knife?
No.
"Judy, Clarence saved your life."
"Don't you know Clarence, your old buddy?"
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.

Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"Yes, Paula, what is it?"
"Well, it's Judy, Dad, she was attacked by a leopard."
"- Well, was she hurt?"
"- Well, not really."
"Clarence chased the leopard away, but there's still something wrong with Judy."
"It's as if she's in shock, Dad."
I'm frightened.
She doesn't recognize me.
"Well, Paula, she's just probably playing games."
She doesn't even recognize Clarence.
"Dad, I think you better get back here and have a look at her."
"Paula, you know I can't do that."
We have to locate Sally.
Judy needs you more.
"Now, uh, Paula, I'm sure Judy will snap out of it."
"Right now, Sally holds the answers to a lot of information the space agency needs."
"Well, I don't care about Sally."
Judy's in terrible trouble and you're chasing some silly astro-chimp around the bush.
"Ah, now, listen, young lady, get a hold of yourself."
"You're not doing Judy, yourself or anyone any good by getting hysterical."
"Now listen, does--does Judy have any physical injuries?"
I'll check.
There's no visible wounds or broken bones.
"Well, does she have any muscle paralysis?"
"I'll tell you what, test her reflexes."
All right.
"- Where you going, dog?"
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
- I'm gonna kill those bitches!
You already did!
Repeat hemogram and update tetanus.
Keep your hand there and don't take it off until you get upstairs.
"- Dr. Corday, when you have a chance?"
- Be right there.
Make sure the blood bank sends type-specific straight to the OR.
Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
- Are you the one...?
- A neurosurgeon will perform it.
He'll talk with you shortly.
- I'm sorry?
- Don't let me die.
"You' re one cold-hearted bitch, you know that?"
"I don't have any damn pity for you, whore!"
"I'm talking to you, pissface!"
"Don't you dare turn your back on me, you stuck-up little ass-shaker!"
Where the hell do you think you' re going?
!
Pardon me.
Coming through.
"Watch your back, sweetie."
Excuse me.
"- Doc, I'm gonna miss the season-"
- Keep your cup on.
I should have been off two hours ago.
You still here?
Can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
Them's the rules.
"Well, these head wounds aren't consistent with the butt of a gun."
They are not.
"They were inflicted with a pointed metal object, perhaps a hammer claw or garden trowel."
"Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left."
Who brings a gun and a garden tool to commit a murder?
"Hopefully, this might provide some insight."
I resisted the temptation to examine it before I could establish proper chain of custody.
You think it was the victim's?
There's one way to find out.

SHINWELL:
Chivonne.
I know you?
I'm your...
I'm Shinwell.
You said you want to talk?
"It's okay, guys."
Catch you later.
"Well, your brother's quite a character."
"And your father, he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
So I have to be a mechanic too.
"Do you wanna go into the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
"More than anything, no."
"You know I don't wanna, uh, overstep my bounds here but you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
The point is there are maybe three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life.
"And you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else."
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to the teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
"Go have your Robin Williams, ""Oh, captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.

GIRL:
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"Benigno, please."
You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
Let's see.
Here it is.
Have you talked to her?
"No, and don't go on about it."
"Goodbye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover""."
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Aif redo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy, and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
You're selfish.
You only think of yourself.
I've got it!
It could be dangerous.
I still haven't tested it on humans.
Do you still think I'm selfish?
It's done wonders for you!
"Don't worry, my love!"
I'll find the antidote!
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Aif redo was shrinking daily."
Come on!
-I hope he's seen it.
-I'm sure he has.
"And with those figures, he will be able to restore the Tardis."
It won't take long.
"Well, while he's sorting that out, perhaps you wouldn't mind explaining something to me."
"Back home in Brisbane, we call that a sweatshop."
This street.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
"Nyssa, my dear."
Father.
"They don't smile, they don't talk to anybody."
Their language is the language of numbers.
And they have no need to smile.
No need to smile?
We are a people driven not by individual need but by mathematical necessity.
The language of the numbers is as much as we need.
"Now, it is important that we do not disturb them."
But if they don't talk to each other...
You've done it!
"Yes, there does seem to be some positive development."
"But what is this mission of yours, Father?"
You're so changed by it.
"You look younger, but so cold."
Logopolis is a cold place.
"A cold, high place overlooking the universe."
"It holds a single, great secret, Nyssa, which you and I must discover together."
-And the Doctor.
The Doctor can help us.
"-Oh, yes, the Doctor can certainly help us."
The druids supposedly hid
From encroaching romans in underground

"Alright, why don't you head back to the hotel."
Stay out of sight.
We'll keep in touch.
"Okay, see you guys later."

Keep trying.
I'm certain he knows.
Da veiga just arrived.
Da veiga has arrived.
He's called the high council into session.
What the hell is he up to?

Following the finest traditions of our order.
My son's life...
For that which you seek.
Fabrice da veiga.
Once the most esteemed brother
Of the gural nataz.
"Now, a man who's reputation"
And even loyalty is in question.
"For no good reason, I assure you."
But to show my trust in the
Chairman's wisdom and mercy...
I have brought the dagger and scabbard.
I have new information for the council.
He is working with sydney fox.
The agent who recovered the case
Saw it for himself.
Just getting to know the city.
Is this a good spot?
"Well, you have to go where the darts are if you're in a darts league."
Big darts game tonight?
Match.
It's called a darts match.
Big darts match tonight?
"You know, the game of darts goes back to the Battle of Agincourt in the 15th century."
The first dartboard was actually the cross section of a tree.
Wow.
You're a real enthusiast.
I kind of like history in general.
I like the perspective on why things happen.
Never been my favorite subject.
"I do love old movies, like ""Casablanca."""
"That's kind of history, right?"
"Ms. Keyes, you are a breath of fresh air."
Call me Saffron.
We're not at work.
"Gary, more vodka shooters before I take your money."
"Your turn, big guy."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, my turn, my turn."
"And, um, when I come back, will you teach me how to shoot a dart?"
"Okay, but are you sure you don't want the reigning champ to teach you?"
Positive.
I imagine Gary knows what he's doing.
"Vodka, vodka, water."
Drink them under the table.
"Okay, okay, okay."
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.
"No, no, I got your covered."
"""Give"""
"No, hampster, her first word was ""grandpa"""
"""Gradpapa."" And that's when you spent your paycheck on the casette player and said we would record her"
Remember now?
"Pavel, you hear me?"
"No, I am not listening to you."
So long.
"Hi, Pavel Ivanovich!"
Again you made a draft.
You have a cold.
Acting like a child.
"--I'm listening --Tell me, people are saying you're planning to take all dogs outside city limits"
--Does that apply to medal-winning dogs?
"--What dogs, what for?"
For them to do their doggy business...
"--Citizen, lady where are you calling?"
"--I'm calling you, ""vice-"""
My dog has 2 medals and one diploma
"Listen, there's a special organization for dogs."
Let them take them out.
"--Zenaida Petrovna, did Vasin come in yet?"
"--Not yet, Valentin Maksimovich"
"When he gets in, send him to me right away"
"--Valentin Maksimovich, please pick up --Say that I'm at the pharmacy"
It's Mamaev
"--Hello, Igor Igorevich --Sorokin, what's with your garages"
"People go to work, and meanwhile their garages get knocked down"
--Everyone had been warned --When?

A year ago?

Should have demolished them then
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, nobody in this room is, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, That's bad."
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, Look at this."
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
"Just because I've been made wiser by my experience on the open road, that doesn't make me any better than you."
"You know, the people that know me?"
I'm just plain simple.
Like string.
I collect string.
"Well, of course you do."
You're perfect for each other.
I can't get in the way of this.
Clearly this is bigger than I am.
"Well, if I hurry, I can just make the parade of sprinkles."
"Eric, if you don't have to take the hitchhiker boy home, not more than five miles from here is Burlick, Pennsylvania."
Tell me about this Burlick.
"Burlick, Pennsylvania, home of the world's largest..."
Yogurt cup.
"Hey, wait a second."
You leave my girlfriend alone.
I'm going to the parade.
8:00?
Perfect.
"Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et messieurs,"
"Senores y Senoritas, Damen und Herren, the internationally-renowned Pottstown, Pennsylvania, parade of sprinkles!"
Look!
The sprinkles is coming.
"Oh, they are beautiful!"
"Hey, why is everybody wearing goggles?"

I know the perfect place to put this.

"Please sit down, Mr..."
Dinamo
"Please, sit"
Thanks.
Smoke?
Very kind of you.
Do you understand the incovenience we have had with the police inquiry?
We are not used to that line of inquiry.
"But I will be delighted to cooperate, with what little I know."
"Hopefully, it will be of use to punish the perpetrator."
"Ms. Bristol, I would like to know about you."
I will spare you from a long line of questioning
Laura?
Give him what I dictaded persuant to the case.
Here you have all I know about the unlucky girl.
"When she was hired, how we met her, etc."
And...
"I will ask for you to bother me no longer, Mr..."
What did you say your name was?
"Forget it, it is not important."
Show him out.
Thanks.
"I need a secretary just like you, when you wish to resign, know that I await you with open arms, eh."
"I would like to have you as a boss, but I am quite pleased with my current job."
"Good bye, Mr. Dinamo."
I do not like that guy.
"Easy, Pascual, easy."
I am tired of this lack of activity!

It's finished.
The taste is perfect.
Prepare your spoons.
Dig in!
I'll go in first.
He always makes his family status apparent.
"Even so, taking the egg yolk for yourself isn't right!"
"Senior, did you just dig in with the spoon you just ate with?"
Seriously.
I won't eat it.
We are doctors that need to keep our health in check.
How could we share a bowl with a spoon?
So I just starved instead.
"Nothing else is hard, but the fact that warm water doesn't come out and-"
You scared me!
"Honey, I will call again."
"Hey, you..."
Please give me something to eat.
"If I come here,"
I heard you guys give out something to eat.
I couldn't come yesterday.
Talk to me from there.
From there.
You can't go around touching people's clothes with those dirty hands.
Hey!
He vomited while suddenly fainting?
"Yes, he was lacking in nutrients so I gave him an IV bag."
His voice was normal.
It doesn't seem like pneumonia.
But it also doesn't seem like malnutrition is the only cause.
His condition is really bad.
Aches between the liver and stomach?
It seemed like the perfect opportunity to show him the concivilized and educational events
ZBZ's gonna be hosting this semester.
It's gonna buy us a little good-will.
It's what good leaders do.
We are so screwed.
What are we going to do?

Thank you.

Of course!
I told the girls I'd step down as sorority's president if we got caught.

"The last day Ágika an early morning started with a little game cart already and while the game cart filled with a borrowed thing,"
Ágika got into the centre of the interest and envy rather continually.
they made him relate the big event again and again.
They were offering everything good to it.
It was celebrated practically
"Don't worry, they don't know who you are."
I didn't come here to catch you.
"Till now, your strength and my weakness were the same."
I didn't know who you were till date.
"But now, both our levels are equal."
Arresting you  killing you is not a big deal.
I won't do that.
Do you know why?
You are my special case.
"You are my partner, aren't you?"
I won't leave you so easily.
I will catch you red handed with evidence.
I will know your every move.
Forget about robbing.
"The moment you think of robbing, I will cut your nerves and pluck your heart out."

Catch...you can never catch me.
This is the real kick.

Check everyone thoroughly before sending them in.
Be it MLAs or Ministers.
Why so much security?
There is a terror threat to the party office.
I know.
I told you that.
Count fast.
- High command has entrusted me to distribute the election funds.
"When you finally killed him, why didn't you call the police?"
"I wanted to, but I was afraid."
"You hadn't committed any crime, defending yourself."
What was there to fear from the police?
I don't know.
I was just afraid.
You had nothing to fear.
"Until you hid Lucas' body, isn't that right?"
But the moment you buried your stepfather's body you had a great deal to fear.
-That's right.
But you buried him!
You must have had a reason... a powerful reason!
And don't tell it was simply because you were afraid.
-I was!
-Are you sure?
-That is the only reason!
-Fear is panic.
"And clearly burying the remains of a man you just murdered requires cold, careful thought!"
-Objection!
-You knew what you were doing!
-I didn't!
I didn't!
"He's not cross-examining, but harassing the witness."
Objection sustained.
I withdraw the question.
I have nothing further.
Miss Cross... at all times during the quarrel that led to the death of Lucas Cross were you in fear of bodily harm?
"-Yes, I was."
I have no further questions.
You may step down.
I wish to call Miss Allison MacKenzie to stand.

you don't deserve to be in a trailer park.
you're gonna do big things in this life -- important things.

- i know so.
"okay, so i have one more gift for you, but you have to turn around."
- hey!
"- well, now you're all ready for college!"
"come here, wayne."
merry christmas.
- oh. excuse me.
"excuse me, miss?"
[chuckles] yeah.
i-is the salon open?
- c-c-can you see that we're in the middle of something?
"- cind, you might want to... ma'am, i apologize for her."
she can be a tad on the abrasive side sometimes.
but her heart's in the right place.
- look at you using all these big college words already.
- i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to intrude.
"i just wanted to know if the salon was open, 'cause i wanted, you know, a redo or a rebirth."
"- you know, i've heard all the stor-  hey, listen, i really don't need to hear your life story, okay?"
"can you come back in an hour, and i'll fix that mess?"
- okay. an hour.
- [chuckling] cindy.
- what?
- you should be nice.
[sighs] merry christmas.
"To dig the earth, Kolya!"
"Come on, help me."
"What's up, Nikolai?"
-ls it here?
-Where?
Next to the dig-out.
He used to be a scout.
"The place is dry here, it looks like a hillock."
-Whom did you bury?
- My dad.
"Well, come on."
"Are you surprised, mayor?"
It means that everything except for the comm point and a fewfiring slots is a mock-up made ofwood.
-A mock-up frontline.
- Exactly.
What about mortars?
Are they made ofwood too?
"No, the mortars, machine-gun slots and cannons are genuine."
"Ifwe considerthe terrain and the water spaces here and there, the firepower is enough... to extinguish a batallion,"
"But not enough to stop the entire offensive, do you mean that?"
What's wrong again?
What are you worried about this time?
There is no such thing as a mock-up frontline.
Ifwe see wood here...
-There must be some metal as well.
- lt is the same thing all over again!
"If ""ifs"" and ""whens"" were pots and pens..."
The offensive here has been confirmed bythe HQ ofthe front and we can not cancel it.
But we'll burythe whole regiment here!
-Do not teach me lessons here!
- l do not.
I've gone through all that before!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?
"When I heard you went to kill the leader,"
I got the fright of my life.
I'm really too embarassed to face you now.
"Because of my bad foresight,"
I got the whole fleet and you into trouble.
Don't blame it on yourself.
The reason I came here was to make a deal with the bandit leader.
"If it weren't for you,"
I wouldn't have thought of it.
"Commander, So Seo-No came to the hideout herself"
What?
What if the deal doesn't go through?
"You may be a merchant, but putting your life on collateral to make a deal, is really too reckless."
"Speaking of recklessness,"
You and I are no different.
I... have already placed my fate in exchange for your life.
"Even if it fails,"
"Even if I die,"
I will not regret this decision.
-Take her out!
-Yes.
"Miss,"
I will place mine in exchange for yours too.
Thanks to ALL of the D-Fansubs Team!
PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD ANY OF OUR SUBS ON ANY WEBSITE WITHOUT OUR PRIOR APPROVAL.
Miss!
Miss!
What happened?
Why you...
You jerks.
Why's she so important?
Because she's a perfect duplication of human DNA in ice crystal form.
The ultimate fusion of snow and humanity.
"To live here, the snow needs to evolve - and she's the blueprint."
She's what they need to become.
"When the snow melted last night, did the pond?"
No.
Living ice that will never melt.
"If the snow gets hold of that creature on the stairs, it will learn to make more of them."
It will build an army of ice.
And it will be the last day of humanity on this planet.
Stay here.
"Oi, I told you to stay in there."
"Oh, I didn't listen."
You do that a lot.
It's why you like me.
Who said I like you?
Argh!
I think you just did.
You kissed me.
You blushed.
And we just...
Shut up.
Argh!
Release her to us.
You have five minutes.
We need to get her out of here - but keep her away from them.
How?
With this - do I always have to state the obvious?
"Those creatures outside, what are they?"
"No danger to you, as long as I get that thing out of here!"
"You, in there - now."
- Why not?
- I don't know.
"He said, he wanted to see it coming."
- When?
- While you're out.
- Did he say anything else?
- Like what?
"Like, why he wants to check out so bad?"
- A little.
- Well?
He's....got bad cancer.
It's in my pancreas and spreading.
Going to die and I'd rather not take the scenic route.
"I don't think he has anybody who loves him either, it must be even worse."
We should think about going to his funeral.
"You know, just so there's someone there."
What?
"At the end of the day, Donnie'll send surviving' members of his squad to finish the job either way."
"So if it's not us to finish, it would be somebody else."
"And besides, this guy's dead already!"
"In fact, it's way better if we're the ones to do it."
"Because unlike Donnie's punks, we're not gonna torture him for eight or nine hours first."
Did you hear somethin'?
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.
What's with the it chilled?
- This?
- Yea.
I've been deputized.
"- I'm serious, Vi."
- Fine!
I had a little incident while I was out getting the bullets.
Take your time.
"Six stab wounds, all in her chest."
Any sign of a weapon?
Dishwasher was running when Chloe found her.
This knife was in it.
"So no chance of any prints on that, then?"
"All the buttons have been wiped clean, too."
Kelly tried to stop him.
Defensive wounds on both hands.
Looks like she put up a good fight.
Not good enough.
And you were just on a night out?
It was Teddy's birthday so drinks at Zu and then on to Belgos for food.
Only Kelly never showed?
She was finishing off some blood work.
Everyone was getting hungry so I called her about 8:30.
She said she was nipping home in a cab to get changed.
Got any idea which cab firm she used?
"Kwik Kall Kabs, we always use the same one."
"When the others left for Belgos,"
Joy and I went to... went to see what was keeping her.
Do you know if anyone wanted to hurt Kelly at all?
She have a boyfriend?
She was supposed to be getting married next month to Tom Hartson.
Kwik Kabs got the call around about 8:30 to pick up a Kelly from the lab and take her home.
Driver dropped her and went on to another pick-up.
You've checked that with the controller?
Yep.
And the next pick-up.
All checks out.
Maybe he remembers seeing someone hanging around outside the flat?
I dropped her off and watched her go in.
- It's a policy we have.
- A policy?
A policy?
That's a damned bad argument.
"If you want to get on in the world, you need to make decisions."
"When you break policies, you show decisiveness."
"Yes, and I think you should go home."
"You stupid, little asshole."
Who do you think you're talking to?
- Run off and get another bottle.
"- Jorgen, we'll go somewhere else."
I'm not the only one that's drunk.
Coming?
I'm sorry.
Empty already?
Those silly little bottles.
- Mother helped too.
- That's good.
"Helene, I would like to have a party on my birthday."
It would be nice.
"Sure, but is one bottle of whiskey each enough?"
"Jorgen, would you please tell me what this is all about?"
I couldn't be bothered.
We're getting up early tomorrow and driving far.
Why won't you let Jacob go home?
You can't just run our lives in your sick head.
Do you know what really doesn't suit you?
- When you feel sorry for yourself.
- Don't talk to me like that.
But I don't understand what you're talking about!
"What have I done wrong, Helene?"
Can't you tell me what I've done wrong?
What do you mean?
We haven't interfered with your business.
"Shuji, you mean you think I had something to do with the hit?"
"Never, never in a million years would I do anything to disrupt our agreement."
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
"Come on, shuji, what do you think I am a fucking idiot?"
What are you trying to say here shuji?
Huh?
"Not me, not my family."
Not anyone who has a future on this fucking earth.
"Someone hires a low life piece of shit that worked for me for five minutes, makes it look like my guys puts you and me in a war together."
It's the last thing I want.
Do you understand?
The last thing.
Mr. tendo will be relieved to hear that.
"Well tell Mr. tendo that he has my full respect, huh?"
One thousand percent.
Thank you.
Any time.
So?
It was him.
Really?
Yes.
Now what?
We eat.
Come on lets go.
Come on.
Wow this is a beautiful house.
I always thought you guys ate on the floor or something.
So how do you like Japanese food?
It's good.
Remember Dan Aykroyd in Ghost Busters with that cigarette?
- He does that scene.
- It's hanging vertically.
"I know exactly what you're talking about, when he finds Slimer."
- How'd he get that cigarette to hang?
- It's incredible.
I'm glad that my life's insecurities of thinking people are mad at me got put to good use in this movie.
"- Yeah, it was such a good choice."
"- Oh, Ari."
I've been thinking that a lot lately.
"The phone rings and, ""Hey, we need to talk about something."""
"I always have the impulse now of saying, ""Are you mad at me?"""
"If I had a dime for every time I say that in life, I'd be a rich woman."
You haven't said that to me.
"You've only been like, ""Do you love me?"""
"""Do you still love me?"""
The answer is always yes.
"That's a pretty good one too, right there."
"Oh, my gosh."
- That's hideous.
- We were laughing filming this.
Right?
For some reason?
- We were giggling.
- Why were we laughing?
"Oh, it was when we were doing that shouting thing, which I can't say..."
I can't say because it's a bad word.
Remember the high-pitched shout?
"Oh, yeah."
"Wait, I thought that was in the van."
I think this is where it became invented.
Unfortunately.
And if it backfires... what do I risk?
Don't ask what you risk... but if you'll be true to yourself.
"The prints of ""Weekend in Sochaux"" are booked all summer."
It's possible in September.
"For unions, it's free of charge."
Fine.
I'll send you the form.
For us the problem was how to incorporate their demans into a larger revolutionary context.
We were stuck.
So we gave the camera to the workers.
What they shot was pretty surprising.
Stronger that what we did.
Their perspective is truer.
They go straight to the heart of the problem.
I think we've gathered enough material.
They want to edit it themselves.
I'm not at all sure about this.
They need a minimum of technical skills.
We have to help.
Monique can go do the technical stuff.
Great.
That settles it.
I went shopping.
Tonight I work at the restaurant.
With the lesbians?
Not lesbians.
Feminists.
Did you pick up the print?
The phone was ringing all day.
But I need it for tomorrow.
So get it yourself.
I didn't mean that.
It is called Nymphs And Shepherds.
Who knows what a nymph is?
"Yes, Brierley?"
"Please, Miss, they're pink and they live in the sea."
You eat them in little pots.
Well...
"That's not nymphs that's shrimps, you fat head."
Hey!
Sh!
"Have you been in a Berni before, Enid?"
No.
"What I like, there's no surprises."
Can I show you to your table?
"Thank you, Barry."
Thank you.
"Thanking you, Barry."
"This is lovely, very kind of you to invite us."
"Yes, very much appreciated."
"We know you're an insurance man, Tubby, and you're basically a secretary, Enid, but we thought you'd like to know a little bit about us."
Shall I launch in?
"# I'm a man, just a man I am happy and contented"
# I appreciate the finer things in life
# And my house is detached and it's obviously not rented
# I've a car and I've something else... # A wife!
# And my life's complete when I take her out to eat
# We have all that we possibly could want
# When we journey in to the Berni Inn
# Our very favourite restaurant
# Please don't panic when you see the Berni menu
# All uncharted waters to explore.. #
Lovely.
# No need to be Magellan... #
"Yep, today is your lucky day."
Awesome !
"I mean, wait, what do you mean ?"
"Well, first, we have to get rid of that dorky bow tie."
"Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man."
Surely we can do something with this hair.
"I think I have some nail scissors in my purse, hmm ?"
I can't get anyone on the phone.
"Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll walk you through it."
Just open up the back door.
"It's easy, don't worry about it."
"Ryan, you're asking me to use tools and exert myself physically."
I think we both know where this is going.
"Yeah, okay, well, uh, start by putting the jack under the frame by the, uh, by the door there."
Yeah.
"The jack is this thing with the handle, right ?"
Yeah.
"Actually, wait."
"First, um... loosen the bolts with that wrench."
All right.
There we go.
Okay.
"All right, you may find this hard to believe, Ryan, but when I was younger, I used to be a bit of a worrier."
You don't say.
"To distract myself from worrying,"
I would sometimes make lists.
Didn't matter what the lists were.
They could be anything...
every cereal
"I've ever eaten, or... uh, the names of every planet mentioned in Star Wars."
Whatever.Anyways...
"You want to make a list, Seth ?"
And here are the complete assets as of...
"Harold, I can't even balance a checkbook."
You'll have to explain it to me.
It's very simple.
"If we don't make some money in the next few months, we're out of business."
How much do you need?
"We need $50,000, partner."
"Oh, we've gone back to a partnership, have we?"
We never dissolved.
Everything's split right down the middle.
Up to now it's been 50%% of nothing.
When do the profits start coming in?
"""We could make a lot of money, Mrs. Brown. "" Remember?"
I remember you thought it was a pretty good idea at the time.
I was wrong.
I guess you should've stayed with John.
"Darling, I didn't mean that."
It wasn't just the money.
"You know that, don't you?"
I know.
Isn't there anything we can do?
"We've got to find some way to raise $50,000."
"Oh, the stuff will sell."
It just takes time.
Have you tried to get a loan?
All over town.
"They'd lend it to John, but they think I'm just a young upstart."
Maybe if John used his influence.
Would that help?
I don't think he'd do it.
"He'd do anything for the company, you know that."
It's worth trying.
"I got it from another source, then I passed it on."
I should have made that clear in my original statement.
I'm extremely remorseful.
"Right, and who was the other source?"
An old friend from my days on armed robbery.
Terry Capistrano.
And do you have any further information?
"No, sir."
Only that I'm extremely remorseful.
"Well, thank you, DC Morton."
No further questions.
Interview terminated.
Wanker.
"Right, well, I'll check out this name he gave us."
"Oh, well, I wouldn't bother if I were you."
Terry Capistrano got Alzheimer's.
He was retired sick.
The poor bugger's lost his marbles.
Convenient.
"Oh, come off it, Kate."
Nigel's just trying to help.
Can we be sure?
"Look, I know he's a mate and everything, but he's a few months off retirement and, between me and you, his missus hasn't been too well lately."
"Well, I really don't give a shit."
"Look, his heart's in the right place."
"Let's just leave this cock-up behind us, eh?"
Please.
Yeah.
"Well, I suppose I can overlook it."
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"Now we know the Caddy's active again, this time we get the bastard."
What we share isn't only blood ties.
What binds us together is emotion
"Of love, of togetherness, and our upbringing"
I will destroy your dreams of magnanimity.
I'll show you... what money's might means.
You slapped Shekhar Malhotra's ego
I will put to auction in the marketplace your temple
Advertise the auction
I will destroy Saraswati Audio.
I'll make a pauper out of Om Batra
Slash prices.
I don't care.
"We have money, he has nothing"
"I've done it, Om"
This is Jai Batra.
He has designed the fastest car
"Sure, I'm ready for the engine tests"
"Shekhar, Jai here."
I'm returning to India
To pay back what Om owes you.
Sure Jai.
Welcome back To India
"But don't come to return my money, come and save your house"
I'm auctioning your house
He was hiding this all along
He thinks his brother is worthless?
He wants to fight it himself?
Why were you hiding this from me?
Om!
You were a father to me!
You were my father
Why did you tear yourself from me?
I've been dieting for a whole half a day and I haven't even lost a pound.
"Sabrina, I found that the key to losing weight is eating the right foods."
Who are you channeling?
The other day I saw you put sugar on bacon.
Lean bacon.
There's got to be something in here that will help me fit in my dress.
"Hey, look at this ad."
"""Thanks to Blubber-Be-Gone,"
"I lost 50 pounds in three days."""
That's ridiculous.
"What'd he do, lop off a leg?"
Here goes.
"""Thin my thighs, lose my roll, make me skinnier than Manute Bol."""
Ooh!
I see you called me in the nick of time.
I did?
Losing weight the Blubber- Be-Gone way is easy.
"Whenever you're hungry, instead of eating food, just mix yourself a shake."
Taste?
Not bad;
although I still prefer ipecac.
SALEM:
"Excuse me, but I think we've met before."
Weren't you selling that turn-your-eye-gunk- into-gold kit a few years ago?
"No, that must have been my brother."
Happy dieting.
This is great.
"I'm going to lose weight,"
"I'm going to look fantastic in my new special dress, and I'll be elected queen of the ball."
Right.
"And one of these days, my pink eye is going to pay off big."
"Oh, no."
"That's it, thanks."
"All right, digger."
How old is he?
A little over a year.
"It can't be anything serious, can it, James?"
It's none of the usual things-- an inverted eyelid or an extra row of lashes rubbing against the eyeball.
"Sometimes, I find him lying in his basket with his eyes half-closed."
"No pain, but there's something wrong."
Nothing shows.
I suppose he might have a long-standing infection in there.
I'll give him some drops.
See how he gets on with those.
"All right, digger."
"Apart from his eyes, he's fit as a fiddle."
Marvelous company when I'm traveling about.
"Get through the work like lighting, don't we, boy?"
"Changed my whole life, this little chap."
Digger.
"Don't worry, Andrew, most of our patients feel that way about the surgery."
Even our own dogs avoid it like the plague.
There we are.
"Thank you, James."
I'm sure I won't have to trouble you again.
Let's hope so.
"Come on, digger."
"Next, please!"
You're an idiot!
An idiot!
"Bad dog, very bad dog."
You're lucky I'm not scooping up the pieces.
Do you realize what a silly animal you are?
Mrs. hall!
Earth...
Fire...
Air...
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the northern portal and trapped Jinora in the spirit world.
"Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers."
"Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer."
"And in the Southern water tribe,"
Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war.
But Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.
Dad's back!
Where's Jinora?
No!
"Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world, but she's going to be all right."
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.
I should have never let Jinora enter the spirit world without me.
I couldn't protect her.
"I'm so sorry, Pema."
"I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
"Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."
You've got a visitor.
"- Hey, Mako."
- Hey.
What's with the fancy duds?
I'm on my way to the big finale
Hero of the South.
"Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you..."
Because you're in jail and stuff.
Thanks for the reminder.
"Hey, I brought you something."
Knocking.
Where's Olive?
Olive Snook was where Lily had taken her.
It was a place that valued Olive's silence as much as Lily did.
"Hello, Betty."
A little bee tells me you've met Kitty Pimms.
Briefly.
"Well, this morning Kitty says to me, she says, ""I wanna speak to Betty Bee."
"Bee-Girl to Bee-Girl, tell her how much she means."""
Bless.
"If there's a lull in the conversation, you just ask Kitty why she loves bees."
Oh?
Oh.
- You'll be glad you did.
- Thank you.
"Betty, I know Kentucky was your number one Bee-Girl and I wanna live up to her standard of honey harvesting and sales excellence."
"You're not really going to stand there and kiss my ass, are you?"
Or didn't Woolsey tell you?
He didn't.
How politic.
- Tell me what?
- His acquisition was a hostile takeover.
"- No, he didn't mention the hostile part."
"- Oh, yes."
The ass you were just kissing is now just the ass of a retired honey mascot.
That's my new title:
Honey mascot/consultant.
Used to be founder and president.
That would make me stinging mad.
"I get to keep my old office, just not my dignity."
"When all of your bees die, it's hard to care about any of it."
- All your bees died?
"I still have to put her medicine in her food, but..."
... she's60percentimproved.
That problem with her fatigas.
Excuse me?
The dog's fatigas is better now.
That problem she had.
Was that a euphemism?
"Oh, boy, here we go with the Latin."
"You know, the fatigas."
It's like the female private parts.
"Boy, I tell you, I'm sweating up a storm here."
You're just a little nervous.
I'll come clean with you. I haven't had sex sober in about 20 years.
"You're not gonna scare me off, Andy."
"I know what you were like, and I know what you're like now."
And I think you're a good man.
"And in your own way, very charming."
So you want to hit the sack?
I'd like it if you kissed me.
I'm getting a new bed cover.
I've got it on order.
-Wanna fold that up or--?
-Sh.
"You realize that if I don't hold up my end, so to speak..."
... Imayhavetokill you.
Somehow it doesn't feel like it's gonna be a problem.

Here...you will have to do this part of the work.
I swear...if I had a physique like yours I would have bowled over all the girls in India.
"In such a big place, where could Kania have hidden the fake currency printing dyes?"
Bobby.
"And you know I love me some Bobby Cobb, but the guy who sees a half-eaten taco on the beach and says, ""Sand snack, score!"""
Is not exactly the ideal financial partner when you have a baby.
- Maybe you could say something to him.
- Relax.
Travis is nothing like Bobby.
"I mean, sure, he has the Cobb instincts, but he uses them in much smarter ways."
50 broken coffee sleeves-- score.
"There's no music class this week because Stan's daddy is, um..."
"Well, he's going through some things, so we don't have a music teacher."
- [ Door closes ]
- You do now!
Who?
"Oh, uh, I'm Grayson."
"Um, yeah, uh, Stan's mom's best friend's husband."
His eyes are so tiny.
[ Laughter ]
"So, the city council just stripped you of your mayorship out of the blue?"
They said I lost public support.
How could that have happened?
You did fall asleep a lot in those town-hall meetings.
My chair was too comfortable.
"And at that ribbon-cutting ceremony, you accidentally cut that guy's finger off with the giant scissors."
His doctor sewed it back on.
[ Sighs ]
"I've lost my Bobby, lost my job."
Now I've lost my mayorship.
I have nothing.
There was the scandal over your leaked Dick pic.
That was a picture of me with a guy named Dick!
That headline was misleading!
- Boom.
Because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.
"Okay, okay, fine."
"Okay, give it to me."
Isn't it a little early?
"No, what it is, is..."
A little cowardly.
"What it is, is selfish."
Your timing is impeccable.
I was a minute from making a clean getaway.
Your assistant told me where I could find you.
Sir...
We really need to talk.
So all I have to do to prevent this lunatic
From keeping his promise is step forward
And declare myself a criminal?
"He knows what you did, sir."
"I don't know how he knows, but he knows."
"And I know it, too."
"Look, I would never secon d-guess what you did."
I might have done the same thing.
And I know how much you stand to lose.
"But unless there's something I'm not seeing,"
I don't think you can keep this a secret much longer.
I think you need to start telling people what you did.
And not to give in to him...
But to keep him from doing something
That you would never recover from.
I mean...
If he hurt some girl...
I don't think you could live with that.
"There's a lot you're not seeing, allison."
But I appreciate your concern.
"If anyone gives you drugs, take them, but do not take them."
Do you understand?
"And I will look both ways before I cross the road, and I will floss after every meal, and I'll wear a sweater just in case it gets cold."
I'll be fine.
"Well, you better be or I'm going to kick your ass."
I'll meet you back here at midnight.
I have to run an errand.
Hey.
Aww...
Did Mike stand you up?
"Vicki, if you're here to grill me again, I just..."
"Listen, Coreen's going to go undercover tonight and I need someone who can blend to the Goth scene, keep an eye on her."
I can't.
Not tonight.
"Henry, there are two men dead and I think there's going to be more."
I need your help.
"And I'm working on something that could prove to be just as dangerous,"
- for both of us.
- I know.
"That's why we should be working together, right?"
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Yes!
Just not tonight.
Okay.
Sure.
"Can't blame a girl for trying, right?"
"You know if you feel like it, we'll be at the Underground later ...you know, if it's not too much trouble."
"Christina, what do you want from me?"
I'm in.
Over.
"Aw, come on, Coreen, it's a one-way radio."
"Hey, have you heard the good news?"
Ellis wanted me to go back to Wales.
"And you what, you couldn't bear to miss the Blitz?"
I'm sorry.
"Well, at least Parfitt will be relieved."
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but then he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you'd found yourself in a similar position, what with your husband's Spanish War wound and all."
Should I...
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?
"And how would that help, losing you?"
Who the bloody hell else do you think's gonna be writing the slop?
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
You're doing a good job.
"Hello, Catrin."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ellis?
I just saw Perry and Conroy.
You had friends over?
I got a letter.
"A commission to document bomb damage in the provinces, and an exhibition in London straight after."
- The National Gallery.
"Oh, Ellis."
"Will there be Sunday trains, do you think?"
Only I'll need to get back to London on Monday mornings.
- What are you talking about?
- Coming to see you.
"Well, you'll be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course."
After the script is finished.
"Well, you can get out of that now, surely."
But I don't want to get out of it.
In the blink of an eye...
"Mrs. Collins, you have a call on our house phone."
It sounded urgent.
..the wife of a US Senator vanished...
She have any enemies?
She teaches second grade.
You have any enemies?
But before they can find out where she is...
- She's gone missing before.
- Twelve years ago.
"Not only did Sara disappear, but the story did, too."
..they left to find out who she is.
Her name's Nicki Johnson.
12 years ago I asked her to marry me.
I never saw her again.
"Now, the mystery is just beginning to unravel"
It's Jessica.
- Your ex-wife ?
- I don't understand.
They've never met before.
"Jessica Nevins, the Senator's ex-wife is considered a person of interest and investigators are attempting to locate her."
"Daddy, what is it?"
What aren't you telling me?
It's Amanda McNeal.
The wife of Curtis McNeal.
He was the mayor of Atlanta.
"Killed back then, kept on ice until now?"
It's a prayer card.
"24 hours ago, Sara Collins, wife of Senator Jeffrey Collins, vanished."
"We're here at the home of Senator Jeffrey Collins, who is about to issue his first public statement since his wife's disappearance."
I'm concerned about Judy Nash and her allegations of marital difficulties.
She's fishing.
"Nah, I'm just kiddin'."
She just likes me for my body.
You look great.
You do something different with your side view mirrors?
"What do you want, Sally?"
"Come on, make this guy fix the road."
The town needs this.
No.
I know his type.
Racecar.
That's the last thing this town needs.
"OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice."
"Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history."
Here she goes again.
"Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!"
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers?
What travelers?
Ignore him.
"But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on?"
"- Luigi, what do you have at your store?"
- Tires.
And if no one can get to you?
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!
"- Flo, what do you have at your store?"
- I have gas.
- Lotsa gas!
"- OK boys, stay with me."
"And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?"
I'll go outta business and...
I hope you don't think what happened last night changes anything.
It changes everything.
You can't still be planning to go into business with that woman.
- I am.
- She won't be satisfied until she has destroyed everything we've created here.
"Don't be fooled, Tommy."
This whole nightmare is because of her.
"Sarah, there is enough blame to go around."
- Is that a dig at me?
- We lied.
Dad lied.
"In fact, right now, Holly's probably the most honest one of us all."
You can't be that naive.
I already told you!
I didn't start this winery for you or Mom.
All right?
I did this for me.
Building something for myself.
That was before the horror show landed on my lap!
"Look, it landed in our laps."
You want to control everything.
"God, you just thrive off of control."
- But this is out of your hands.
"- Spare me, Tommy, OK?"
"I already pay for therapy, I really don't need your amateur psychoanalysis."
Just let it go.
OK.
"Well, clearly I'm the only one who still gives a damn about Ojai, so you'll understand that I have work to do."
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Holly Harper.
She's not in her office.
I don't know where she...
Master
"Gao Jian, I took pity on you as a young orphan"
That's why I kept you here to learn martial arts
"But you're not behaving well, causing trouble"
And have no respect for your elders!
"If you don't want to stay here, you can go!"
"Master, it's not my fault 2nd and 3rd Brother have ill treated me"
"And in turn, falsely accused me as the villain!"
"Master, don't listen to him!"
He hurt us on purpose
Brother's wound can get serious if we wait longer
"Master, it hurts so much!"
Shut up!
Dad
Let me check
That's not your business!
What's the first rule of our school?
T roublemaker and treacherous fighters
Will be punished severely!
A crab and claws eight
A head of this shape
A wink and a shrink
Hooray as it came!
"Good brother, drink together"
"A four, a five and a six"
Drink till you're sick!
I'll drink.
I've never hesitated for a drink
Roasted chicken wing
My all time favorite!
And roasted pigeon?
It's just amazing!
I know the difference.
I hope you told the cops that.
Did you have any alcohol at all?
"Like two glasses of champagne, three tops."
And the boys were in the car?
Does it help that I was taking them to Disneyland?
It does not.
"So, what do we do about Diane?"
I have no idea.
You have no idea?
You're my lawyer.
"Yeah, well, I'm thinking of leaving the law..."
Starting a zoo.
Because I seem to have discovered the only animal in the known world that can actually fuck itself.
Wow.
"Please don't take this the wrong way, Matt, but you are the worst client I ever had, seriously."
I'd happily trade you for two Mel Gibsons and a Tiger Woods.
Jesus!
"As far as the D.U.I., this is your first offense, amazingly, so we can probably get you off with a little community service."
"As far as Diane, you're on your own."
Jesus!
Yep.
The new guy's changing everything.
Time to get out the old résumés.
"Well, I think that's premature."
I don't have a résumé.
How do you not have a résumé?
This is the only place I've ever worked.
"Well, except for the summer after college."
I was one of the snow whites at Disneyland.
I never knew that.
I worked the Graveyard Shift.
"We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?"
"Come, come, Kali."
My towel.
"Say, Jack."
- Buck's gone again.
"- Yes, I know."
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
"Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company."
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
"According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago."
"I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake."
"- Yes, I-I know, but-"
- If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin!
That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
"Why, Jack, I never suspected."
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
"Oh, I want to write poetry."
I want to compose.
"I want to sing, paint."
You go from here.
I wont find the same situation again.
"You dad with me in this room, on bed... final the car's deal."
Car's deal when?
Now here on this bed... should i tell Sonu?
No...
why?
Youth dad wanted to hide from you.
Actually he bought the vintage car to sale his stuff... in 1000000/-.
1000000/-?
"What is all this Dad, we already have car, cancel."
"Cancel the deal, the deal is cancel."
"Laxmi Jee you told deal done, bed!"
But dad?
Deal is done.
But my advance of 100000/-
i and sitting in front of underworld don.
You know... why i have started undergarment business.
Because it has under like underworld.
I got this 100000/-
"Laxmi Narayan Jee, thank you, the car is yours, i should leave now, i have to make agreements papers."
Come at 4 o'clock and get 900000/- too yeah sure.
You saved me.
And you caught me.
I always wanted to marry some... some underworld don.
"How excited, how thrill there life is."
Husband go in the morning.
And wife didn't know if the husband will come back home or not.
In the night when husband come back and kiss.
It is feel like that's a last kiss.
Because don't know from where bullet can come.
And husband could have encounter.
"[ Man ] Officer, how can you testify... that Superboy jumped off that bridge when you didn't see him jump?"
"I mean, I'm looking at your statement right here... that you filled out at 0200 hours."
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna object because we went through this.
"[ Lawyer ] Now, he's been up all night."
How many times are you gonna ask the same question?
"Let me ask you another question, brother."
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
"- What kind of question is that, Lieutenant?"
- Counselor.
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
- You think those white boys on that bridge--
"- Come on, Lieutenant."
- Please.
I object to this!
"- What do you think this is, Mod Squad?"
- [ Lawyer ] I'm offended by this.
- [ Men Arguing ]
"All right, all right!"
"All right, listen."
"He doesn't tell us what we want to know, he's gonna lose his job."
That's about as simple as I can make it.
He's gonna lose his fuckin'job.
All right?
Do you want that?
What do you take us for?
"A bunch of fuckin' morons, huh?"
- What is the matter with you?
"- With all due respect, I think--"
"- You be quiet, you be quiet!"
Shut up!
- I believe--
"Then just check ,no opinion.,"
"I,m not checking anything."
"You can, if you Iike, but I won,t check just any box."
"This isn,t tic-tac-toe!"
"We,re getting off the point."
"We,re lucky this is on camera, or no one would believe it."
calm down!
Just checking.
"Let,s put 8."
I give up!
This is a loony bin!
"At the risk of being rude,"
"Jean-MicheI, last night you suffered once again from premature ejaculation."
Perhaps.
It happens sometimes.
"But I think you,re being judgmental or trying to annoy me, and that,s out of line."
"Listen, we practically live together, yet we hardly know each other."
"For exampIe, what,s your relationship?"
"I,m not sure how to take that."
"You know everything about us, but we -"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Let,s say you,re at the post office."
You wait in line.
You buy stamps.
"Do you ask the employee,s name or who they voted for?"
"I,m just saying it might be nice."
"well, what do we put down?"
I get it - another test.
"You,re trying to get us to crack."
- Is this on purpose?
- Where were we?
please answer me:
Notan operation so much as an organic phenomenon.
It grew.
Itchanged shape.
It developed appetites.
It's not unusual in such cases... thatthings are not committed to paper.
Thatcould be very embarrassing.
I sawto itthatmy name was never connected with any ofthese operations.
- Dien.
- [Gunfire]
- Trujillo.
- [Birds Chirping]
Lumumba.
Guatemala.
Iran.
Cuba.
"It's a shame you didn'ttake similar precautions, Dick."
I'm interested in those documents that put your people... togetherwith the gangster elements.
- I'll hold the documents.
"- Kennedy threatened to smash the C.I.A., into a thousand pieces."
You could do the same.
I'm notJack Kennedy.
"Uh, your agency is secure."
Not if I give you all the cards.
[Sighs]
I promised the American people peace with honor in SoutheastAsia.
"Now, thatmay take time."
"Two, maybe three years."
"But, in the meantime, your agencywill continue... atcurrent levels offunding."
Current levels may not be sufficient.
"Well, the president will support... a reasonable request for an increase."
And me?
"Of course, you will continue as D.C.I., Dick."
"- It's called going off at half-cock, Harper!"
"- Yes, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
"Fall in, Rifleman Harper."
"Yes, sir."
"Thank you very much, sir."
Wait.
Do you not wish your officer to give you some high honours?
"Oh, but he did."
He told me to fall in.
"Lieutenant Sharpe,"
I think it better if you now take command.
Get down!
"That fella's the dead spit of you, Major."
Something you want to tell me?
And what are your orders?
Open that chest and tell me what's going on.
"I'm sorry, not until we reach Torrecastro."
My orders are to meet someone at Casa Antigua.
But if they are not here...
Your fellow countrymen need your protection to Torrecastro.
"Naturally, as officer commanding, I travel by coach."
Just like a proper officer.
Then it transpired that my poor uncle had left a small legacy for the purpose of spreading the message of Methodism to the Papists.
Ireland was well spread so it had to be Spain.
So here we are
Mrs Parker and sowing the seed
I didn't know Methodists smoked.
"Oh, it's for my lungs."
Sorry.
"Sorry, I can't."
Not yet.
This could be really good for our marriage.
"I mean, if there are things bothering us about each other, we should just get them out there, you know?"
It's healthy.
I guess.
"All right, so come on."
"Hit me, baby."
Uh...
I guess maybe sometimes...
You wear a little too much makeup.
What do you mean?
"Well, just, you know, all that goop over there."
Sometimes I think you could just...
Back her down a notch.
"Ok, this is stinging more than I thought it would."
So you really think I wear too much makeup?
No.
"I just-- like if we're going out for burgers, you know, and I throw on a pair of sweatpants and a baseball hat, you look like you're going to the opera..."
Or you're in the opera.
Ok.
Ok.
I will try to wear less makeup.
"Well, this is great."
All right.
"But we're gonna do this together, ok?"
And I'm gonna join a gym and start to diet.
I'm gonna whip this body into shape 'cause nobody's calling me fatty mcbutterpants anymore.
Somebody called you fatty mcbutterpants?
"On line at the bank yesterday, yeah."
And it took seeing the big and tall bag to push you over the edge?
Mmm-hmm.
Ok.
I dieted for the last 8 hours.
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed."
-Look at that.
-What?
-No way.
"-That's carved, without a doubt."
"Yeah, I would say so."
That's...
doesn't look natural to me.
There's no doubt in my mind that that's etched in there.
It certainly has the appearance of being cut into the stone.
"Yeah, it does."
"Well, what is that in there?"
Like a little dot?
-Yeah.
It's like it's got an eye in the middle.
"My God, yeah, I can see it."
Acarvedtriangle?
Withaneyeinthecenter?
Therearelotsof triangular shapes associatedwithOakIsland.
The triangle shape meant something to the Templars.
Isthataconnection?
Perhaps.
"Thesymbolof atriangle-- orpyramid--withaneye depicted in the center isknownas  ""The Eye of Providence,"""
"orthe""all-seeingeye ."""
"Itwasadoptedby the Freemasons inthelate18thcentury, althoughtherearemany who believe that it dates back muchearlierto thedays of the Knights Templar."
"In1935,"
"U.S.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, aFreemasonwhohad actually searched for treasure onOakIslandasa youngman, instructedthattheall-seeing eye be added to the design oftheone-dollarbill."
"Itisalsothe shape of a triangle that appears inthecarvingson the mysterious 90 Foot Stone, andwhichcanbe seeninthedimensions of the Oak Island swamp, whichmanybelieve to have been man-made."
"Okay, yep, she's good, buddy."
"So, next step, you're gonna get geared up?"
-Yep.
-Perfect.
"Comms check, one, two, three, four, five."
Yes.
"It's a lot to ask of you, Alice, I know."
"But that's what families are for, right?"
"Yeah, he's just walked in, Jeff, as a matter of fact."
Yes.
"So, absolutely, I'll pass it on."
"Okay, if you can just watch your shooting ratio, love."
"Yeah, we'll see you then."
Cheers.
-How are things on location?
-Very hot apparently.
He said it's like a furnace in that room.
'Cause they're right under the flight path they've got to keep all the windows closed and there's bugger all ventilation.
But they're all thrilled with the material.
He said the whole thing's got a real buzz to it.
It's gonna be really different to the rest of the series.
And John's put together a bit of cut material for you to have a look at.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
-What?
"-No, I've just... been getting a lot of static electricity today."
"Just after I'd polished the table, it was a combination, maybe, the friction and the weather."
"Anyway, what happened to you?"
You get whiplash or something?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What?
What?
Tell me.
I went to an orgy.
"Yeah, right."
-What did I say?
I said you wouldn't believe me.
-An orgy?
Just leave; okay?
( Engine Starting )
MISS GILDER:
"If a man can excavate 10 cubic yards of earth in 6 hours, what can one man excavate in a day?"
Planet earth to Mikey.
So what do you get?
40 cubic yards.
That's very good.
We're gonna do silent study now.
Please turn to chapter 3.
"And Mikey, could you come here for a minute?"
And bring your book.
Do you want to show me what's so interesting in that book of yours?
"Come on, Mikey, give."
It can't be that bad.
What have you done?
I...
I...
NEIL:
"Based on this, you think Mikey has an emotional problem?"
All we're suggesting is that maybe Mikey should see a child psychologist.
Christ!
I made a picture like this when I was kid!
I know.
But we feel that Mikey may be-- just may be-- suffering from an emotional disorder called unattached syndrome.
It's very common in adopted children.
Don't you know anything about his history?
I know Mikey.
"If anything, he's brighter than other kids."
"It's not a question of whether he's bright or not, Rachel."
Most kids don't mutilate their own arms with thumbtacks.
He did what?
- Nothing.
- Maybe we could go.
In what world would I want you to come along?
"- It's not for you, it's for us."
- It'd be funny to watch you fuck it up.
"Yeah, you might cry."
"Thanks for the vote of confidence, but you won't want to come."
I'm seeing her at this under-18s night she's working at.
"It will be uncool,"
- even for us.
- Sounds OK to me.
- At least we'll definitely get in.
"- No, no."
- You won't like it.
- We might even get some.
Won't they be a bit young?
- Grass on the pitch and it's OK for me.
"- Right, and what if there isn't?"
By the time you find out it'll be too late.
Surely you've got better things to do than watch me with Charlotte?
"Great, no, fine."
See you there then.
"So before my date with Charlotte, and it was a date,"
I had to endure one last day with the savages.
I was pleasantly surprised to find Jim and Wolfie engaged in serious debate.
"All right, Will?"
"You'll like this - we're just having ""a discussion""."
"- Oh, really?"
- Which titties would you spunk over?
"The little ones, or big and bouncy?"
"A handful, plenty to play with."
- They both look nice.
"Well, I know you know."
"Now, I may have run across Mrs. Sellers at the grocery today."
And she just may have mentioned that
John was gonna give me his pin tonight?
Possibly.
"I have lots of pins from lots of boys, Mama."
"I know, Zelda dear."
"I've been followin' along lo these many years, but somehow this one's different, isn't it, baby?"
"How do you know when it's different, Mama?"
I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
What kind of answer did you want?
"Well, he cares about you a great deal."
Anyone can see that and...
"You know, he'll certainly be able to care for you."
Those are not unimportant things.
I know that.
"You and Daddy never think I do, but I do."
It's what worried everyone so about Scott.
"But, Mama... you weren't happy marrying' Daddy."
"Oh, come now, Zelda."
I know there were other possibilities.
Were you in love with any of them?
You can find something to love about every man if you put your mind to it.
I don't want to have to put my mind to it.
"But you will, baby."
Whether you want to or not.
I'm just gonna run this laundry downstairs.
"I can do that, Mama."
"Oh, of course."
"Thank you, dear."
[ticking]
I'm late.
My husband and child are expecting me.
I'm sorry.
Nobody is expecting me.
"- Goodbye, Pavlos."
"- Goodbye, Aliki."
That was 'I love you!
' all about.
It didn't end and it never will...
A great love starting with a counterfeit sovereign useless any more...
"False, however, is not only the counterfeit sovereign in the story."
False as a whole is money.

(barking orders)
Look at me-- guard duty again tonight down at the main gate.
Who's going to steal the main gate?
KADOWSKI:
"Hey, boys, get this."
-What is it?
-This is serious.
"""Permission granted for ten days leave of absence to Master Sergeant Ernest Bilko."""
Bilko going on a furlough?
He's broke.
Here we go again.
"Gentlemen, I wish to announce the beginning of National Hide Your Money Week."
Remember the last time Bilko went on furlough?
"He squeezed every nickel out of this platoon, remember?"
"No, no, no, I tell you, no."
"I can't spare another truck, and that's final."
How am I going to get my platoon back to the barracks from the rifle range?
"Oh, wait."
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
No!
"You have got yourself a real prize there, young lady."
"I know, mom, he's a great guy."
He's more than a great guy.
He does whatever I ask him to do and eats whatever I toss up on the roof.
It's like having a big pet raccoon that can fix stuff.
Oh.
There's my hard-working man.
"Nice fit, huh?"
Two more pockets and I'm a pool table.
"Mike, why, why are you wearing my dad's clothes?"
"Oh, I gave him a bunch of daddy's stuff."
"You know, the last time he wore this suit, we were sharing a ""j"" at a Doobie brothers concert or sharing a doobie at an O'jays concert..."
I forget.
It was the Doobie brothers.
I found the ticket stubs and an ancient tootsie roll.
"Oh, daddy loved his tootsie rolls."
Can I see it?
"Well, the real memory is the ticket stubs, right?"
I'm kind of freaking out here.
"Mike, you don't have to wear that."
Why?
I think I look pretty good in it.
"You look like you should be standing in a field, selling green beans."
"Never mind her, you look great."
"Now, why don't you sit right down here at the head of the table?"
"We're having pot roast, mashed potatoes, and your favorite dessert..."
banana cream pie.
That's not his favorite.
"No, no."
No it doesn't.
No.
How can you read it?
It's just moving all over the place.
Let me see that Lilly.
I'm sorry.
But I mean how much more bad news can you take?
I mean you just found out you don't get to go to college.
With your best friend the day after you get rejected.
By the best boyfriend you ever had.
And now you've got an eye twitch.
But my grades are awesome.
I killed it on the SAT.
This is so not fair!
I know.
I mean I guess that stuff just wasn't important to Jesse.
And Stanford accepted you?
Lilly stand extremely still and don't let her sense your fear.
There has got to be some kind of mistake!
Lilly and I have just about the same grades.
And she only did a little bit better on the SAT.
And that's because my energy drink made me have to tinkle twice.
And Lilly can hold it like a camel!
I must say the fact that you just drove 200 miles.
To plead your case is very impressive.
That's the kind of character we look for here at Stanford.
We're going to be very sad not having you here.
Cookie?
This isn't fair.
I am being discriminated against.
Because I have a small bladder.
And now I'm a cheating scoundrel?
"As long as you're a do-yooder, everything's hunky dory... as long as I deny myself, as long as I give away millions... without a word!"
"Am I to apologise because I'm rich, moneyed?"
Mr Om is saying nothing of the sort.
Why are you getting upset?
I'm upset because I considered him my friend
He's more than a brother to me
And he says I have deceived him?
"Well all right, I have deceived you"
Why don't you return my money?
Why not prove that love is stronger than money?
"The three of you, Om, Jai and Jagadish"
"Come on, get together!"
Pay me back
"Else, vacate your house in 48 hours."
I'm going to get a court order
And don't come to work from tomorrow onwards
They will vacate the house.
"You told me, they're men of word"
"Papa, Uncle Jai is leaving"
Brother...
Yes Jai...?
I want to talk to you.
You are returning?
"Yes, I'm leaving"
"If I don't leave, there will be a big problem"
Do you have your green card?
I have it
But I might lose my job.
You got my go-ahead
"Besides, what can you achieve living in this country?"
Go away
-We push!
Good evening Antwerp!
This is gonna be good!
One Direction One Direction!
"Europe has been so crazy because there's a lot of fans who have been there  for you know a year two years, three years."
And they've just waited for us to come.
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"berlin, make some noise!"
"I think we're in the 50s now, Iike 53, maybe 54 out of 1 30-something shows."
So we're nearly halfway there.
You sing.
Sing it.
"Just a natural, really, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't mess about, that's the main thing for me."
I think the Europe trip so far has just flown by.
When you think about tour rehearsals and everything...
-...it seems such a Iong time ago now.
-I know.
Do you remember when we met at boot camp?
Yeah.
"I just saw you darting around in your beanie every day and just being like, "" Hey, I'm Harry."""
"Those were the days, man."
"NiaII was the loudest person at boot camp, without fail."
"Wherever NiaII was, there was a guitar there was noise and there was loads of people around him."
-He was so popular.
"-Yeah, I remember."
"When we first got together, there was always little clashes."
Yeah.
But there wasn't anything huge.
Do you remember when we went to the coffee shop and Zayn didn't turn up?
-There was a serious conversation.
"MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med."
"I mean, what do you have to worry about?"
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.
"Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition."
"You know, the 2.09 Competition?"
"Wait, no."
I'm building a car that drives by itself.
"Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year, so it's kind of important."
"Ben, let the car drive by itself."
"Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed."
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.
"Ben, you were born for this."
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
"- No, of..."
- No.
"You're one of my favorite new students, and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean."
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.
It's boxy.
It's blue.
How is that not you?
"So, how much is this thing gonna run me?"
"Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%."
The jacket's $589.99.
Did you two get into my four-quadrant popcorn tin?
Relax.
We were just sniffing it.
Stand up and show me your fingers.
"If I see any cheese dust, you're both grounded."
Dust-free.
You happy?
"Dude, you're unbelievable."
Popcorn is the snack of the people.
No.
It's a snack for dads only.
I get one tin a year from my armoire dealer in Cincinnati.
It's the only thing that gets me through the season.
"There are so many sad things in that sentence, but I honestly think the winner is ""Cincinnati."""
"Well, just keep your hands off the tin."
That's it.
End of story.
And the same goes for the thermostat.
"Yeah, I see you two looking."
That's 'cause it's colder in this house
- than it is outside.
"- Yeah, man."
Can't you spare like two more degrees?
"If you two are so cold, go out and shovel the walkway."
That ought to work up a sweat but good.
"Murray Goldberg had a lot of dumb dad rules, but nothing equaled his hard line on snow."
And no monkeying around out there when you're done.
- This weather is treacherous.
"- Oh, here we go."
Another lecture on the dangers of cold weather.
I'm serious.
It's not safe out there.
- How's everybody doing?
- Good.
You?
So far...
There's the little momma.
I got a little something for the kid.
I won it at a fair last night.
That is so sweet.
- I'll see you guys later.
- Call me later.
- Coffee?
"- No, I'm good."
What's up?
Just hearing about these American guys coming into town.
- You know anything about this?
- Do I know anything?
They've been giving my guys a hard time.
Selling good weed for cheap.
"I've been chasing them off, but then they took over the park across the street."
- They coming in here?
- They showed up at my brother's club.
Just a matter of time before we see them here.
We should do something before something gets out of hand.
What about the bank machines?
"I'll have my accountant look at the final numbers, but I think we're done."
You wanna talk about the weed?
You'll have the Eastern connection.
We're looking for commission on deals.
- Are you gonna want to work with me?
- Gonna have introduce you around.
- So we have an agreement here?
- We'll start exploring it.
"Sisters, you're about to make urgent use of your rush rotation skills."
We have an unexpected visitor in our mix namely dean Bowman.
"Our mission is to keep him occupied, failure is not an option."
Are you with me?
Good!
Let's move out!
Are you guys coming back?
Incredible!
And then what happened?
- I graduated from highschool.
- Highschool?
That's facinating!
"- And, then what?"
- I went to college.
So... so do you live around here?
"Dean Bowman, can I tell you what a privilege it is to have you at your party?"
What a great tie!
So?
Are you really thinking of joining the Kappa Taus?
I haven't decided yet.
What do you think about it?
You see how much fun we can have.
- I know you love strip clubs.
- Boobs.
You don't think it wouldn't be awkward though?
"- I mean, if we're dating other people."
- Doesn't have to be.
"You should meet Greg, I really think you'd like him."
"Yeah, it'll be a little awkward."
I don't want to change your mind or anything.
I really miss hanging out with you.
Me too.
Never mind.
"I've never even met you, never fucking heard of you, but I know your kind."
You're the spawning infestation of micro-cocked little bitch bloggers who take shots at people who are out there actually doing real shit.
"Nobody likes you, bro."
You're a fucking zero.
You have no friends.
"Jesus Christ, himself, wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire while holding the virgin Mary."
"Keep up the good work, player."
Have a nice day.
"Yours in perpetuity""..."
Didn't even know you knew that word...
"""Alvey 'your king' Kalina."""
"Alvey Kalina, maker of men, father of three, and business owner."
I was drunk.
"Yeah, you're one of those, too."
Nobody reads that jerk-off.
They do now.
This went viral.
There are lists and comments.
"""He's come unhinged."""
"""Fucking nuts."""
You made Mario Goldsmith relevant.
[Laptop lid thuds]
"Know your enemy, tough guy."
The enemy is you.
How much weight are you gonna lose?
"Um, like 30 pounds."
- Are you starving?
- I could eat.
You're a masochist.
"Yeah, and you're..."
- You're the other one.
I know your apartments are above the offices.
Maybe you still have a room there?
I would like to stay in the place during the night.
Thank you.
Say.
Does your servant live here?
"No, he is married and has children."
He goes home.
"If that's what you want to know, we'll be three in the apartment."
Sir?
Forgive me.
Thank you.
"Philippe, I no longer need you."
You can withdraw.
I really doubt something will happen.
Individuals who threaten us will surely be wary.
I guess that they already know you spend the night here.
My presence here won't prevent them from acting.
I hope that my room will please you.
"I'm sure, but..."
I'm sorry to put you out of your own room.
I did rearrange it with great care.
That I do not doubt.
"My partner got the ceiling and floor screwed, very complicated works, because the room, which was in good condition, was not to his taste."
"It is in a room that one passes half his life, doesn't it?"
It's late.
We will accompany you.
I know the way.
I insist.
"If you need something, I'm in the room in front of yours."
Thank you.
Everything is perfect.
- You don't even belong here!
- Hey!
"I got a few hang-ups of my own, you know!"
"For example, what do you know about welfare?"
Anybody here ever been shafted by welfare?
[Neva] Are you jiving me?
I went through a trip with welfare last summer you wouldn't believe.
"My mother is 65, and she's sick in bed, right?"
"So they ask her to come down for an interview. ""Could you come down for an interview, please?"""
And they treated her like she...
"like she was stickin'her hand out, trying to steal their lousy money!"
"- Man, you got a problem with welfare?"
I'm with you.
"- Hey, wait a minute!"
"What is this welfare business, huh?"
The way you're dressed?
[Laughs] What do you think we're stupid or something?
We're-We're...
We're getting put on here!
[Seymour] You know something?
He might be right.
All right.
Who the hell here has a grudge against a chick by the name of Alice Fisher?
"Hey, who are you, mister?"
"And who in this group hates German cars, underground garages, advertising agencies?"
- And who hates welfare?
"- Please, Lieutenant."
- And who hates marine recruiting officers?
"- [Dr. Benton] No, Lieutenant."
Not here!
- [Panicked Whimpering] - [Woman Screaming]
"[Kojak] Hold it, Zucco!"
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything!
No way.
A guy with just one arm.
We should buy him a barrel organ and give him 2 Mark.
We gotta take care of him!
What use is a one-armed man to us?
What use is a headless man to us?
- Why?
- Because he's starting to make sense.
He just wants to spy on us!
I know what he wants.
I'll test him and take responsibility for his actions.
"Mieze, you gotta look after him!"
They treat him like dirt.
"I'll go and work for him, even if it means playing a barrel organ!"
I know those guys quite well.
You gotta watch out that they won't be a bad influence on him.
Understand?
"Tomorrow evening, right?"
And Biberkopf is really gonna be with us?
Sure!
What's wrong with that?
One bale of cheviot 75-02.
Half a bale of worsted 75-64
One bale of cheviot 75-66
How many bales are missing?
Half a bale of worsted 75-69
Half a bale of worsted 75-98
Just yesterday my wife said to me that this door was unbreakable.
And they came through the roof!
They took excellent english goods!
(laughs)
"Hey, let me tell you, your wife Alice really outdid herself with this stuff."
This is just delicious.
Here.
"Try this, Ralph."
"- Hey, that's great."
-How about that?
Got a real different taste to it.
(mumbles) You're a lucky guy.
Anything Trixie ever fixes for me is right out of the can.
"Now, if this could come out of the can, that would be different."
This is terrific.
- Norton.
-What?
You just gave me a million-dollar idea.
All I have to do is put this stuff in cans.
"Ralph, you're sitting on a gold mine!"
You could make a million dollars!
I don't care if I make a million dollars.
This is the thing I've always wanted to do for Alice.
Why should she cook just for me?
And just have me enjoy it?
I could put it in cans and the whole world can enjoy her cooking.
I'm gonna make her rich and famous.
I'll run the whole business for her.
All she'll have to do is sit back and collect.
"Boy, oh, boy, that is a worthy sentiment."
I mean it.
"Now, all you got to do is get ahold of Alice and get the recipe."
Then we're off.
"Now, that's the last thing I have to do."
All I have to do is tell Alice that I got a scheme to make money and she'll say it's a crazy scheme.
Hit him again!
Give him an amp of epi!
Nothing!
He's has multiple-system failure.

No.

"I was starting to think that your absence was from sulking, Robbie."
"And what, and miss such a performance?"
"A puppet is still a puppet, French prince or not."
"Oh, hush will you."
Kill him!
"A Jesuit missionary, found spreading subversive propaganda."
"Whatever the crime, grisly fate for any man."
"But then a man's fate lies in his own hands, does it not?"
Is this choice of being here too remind me where my loyalties lie?
A lesser man might be insulted.
"We're under no illusion, Master Gifford."
The ten years we've kept the Queen of Scots confined has made her a martyr to her Catholic supporters.
My Lord Burghley.
"The gentleman I spoke of, Master Gifford"
"We also know... another attempt to rescue her, has been devised."
It's details...we lack
The Catholic's League in Europe is behind this one.
"Once our freedom is secured,"
"Dude, don't give into temptation..."
"I love your use of slow-mo, Pete."
"Good job there, Mike."
"That's not slo-mo, that Alexis' performance."
"Oh, God."
You think it's easy to achieve that?
- Damn.
- Slo-mo acting.
Damn lady.
I just wanna say I feel like we set a ridiculous pace for this commentary and now we're all finding it hard to keep up.
We realized this is gonna go on for two hours.
It's a good thing that we have Pete's list of questions.
My coffee is starting to wear off.
"Oh, my God."
- This was shot in the studio...
- Stage.
This was the very last thing we shot.
"Actually, the very last thing we shot on the movie during principal photography was the moment..."
Was your orgasm.
- The overhead shot on the couch.
"- Oh, that."
"But that morning, on day 29 of shooting, we shot this."
I remember sitting there watching this because it was beautiful.
- So this wasn't a reshoot.
- Were you wrestling?
"- No, this is principal photography."
- Right.
- Were you really tickling each other?
"- Yeah, that was real tickling."
"I love this song, by the way."
- This song by The Submarines.
- The Submarines.
- I don't date potential employers.
You'll have lunch and a professional conversation.
"If you consider that a date, your social life must be lame."
- It is.
- We're having a baby.
I am trying to be a good mother.
That's what he wants here.
- He has a mother.
"- But she's not here, and I am."
- Why are you leaving?
"- I've had some bad ideas in my life, but thinking I could work here and share an office with you is one of the worst."
How you doing?
"No, I work here now."
I'm not kidding.
"Hey, stud."
Hey!
Whoa.
Blind stud.
I got soap in my eye.
"Sorry, but what you did back there?"
It was incredible.
Sure it was me and not the hormones?
"Oh, it was you, all right."
"Well, I do aim to please."
Good.
Because I'm nowhere near finished with you.
I barely left the house most Sundays.
"My mom would cook elaborate dinners for neighbors, friends and sometimes people we barely knew."
"By ten, I could whip up a perfect meringue, deglaze a pan, truss a chicken."
"But by the time puberty rolled around, I'd had enough."
"Football, friends seemed more important."
So I told her I was done.
"Oh, you pretty things."
That's right - north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
"Oh, if you could only cook."
"Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning."
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
"Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em."
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
"You're wrong, Claire."
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way - that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
"When there's something you need, grab it."
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope.
It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
"Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below."
Good night.
"- Night, Shorty."
- Night.
"Good night, dice."
Summer's just around the corner.
You're thankful.
"If house would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here."
"Look straight forward, tell me when you can see... it's your job to go back!"
You're a doctor!
You go where the disease is!
Say when you can see the light.
"I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?"
Tell me when you can see the light!
My vision's fine!
Your left-side periphery is reduced.
"It's fine, I'll prove it."
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Now we're both exposed.
You got two choices.
"You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment... you save me, the cop, and yourself."
It's not sspe.
I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.
No batch matches.
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
"Guys, could you please shut him up?"
He's over his limit on morphine.
Where's cameron?
She said she has some stuff to do.
Said she'd be back soon.
What are you doing?
Foreman!
Stop!
I can't take it!
Imagine being constantly reminded of the... pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it!
Stop it!
That's a lot of money.
But not for Danny boy.
Somebody else can marry that teddy bear.
"I'll just take the $50,000 and-- [whistles]-- blow away."
Just thought I'd mention it to see what you had in your mind.
Yeah?
"You, uh..."
"You wouldn't be thinking of running out on me, would you, lover?"
Do I have a choice?
No.
Not unless you want the police in Chicago to know where you are.
"All right, you made me set it up for you."
"Look, Aunt Olivia's going to be wearing the diamonds, not Merle, so with that little piece of information, will you please just get out of here and leave me alone?"
"- And leave Merle alone, too."
- Okay.
Okay.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Danny.
How are you going to do it?
The same old way?
"You know, you're too much."
Get out of here and leave me alone!
"Leave Merle alone, too!"
"Danny, how are you going to do it, the same old way?"
"What do you think I am, a sucker?"
But I might tell a partner.
"Oh, forget I asked."
You're blowing a great opportunity.
"With all the contacts you can make with that camera and my talent,"
- we could retire in a year.
- I'm going to retire right after this one.
Then make it a good one.
"""Okay, sounds good,"" and he's gonna go off and do whatever he wants to do."
And you know that.
"So my advice to you is, please, get confirmation on these rumors, and get the truth, and share that truth with Steve."
Because you know and I know that he's not gonna stop until he gets it.
Are you sure it was Sato's men?
I don't know.
It could've been the Triads.
Here's what you need to do.
You need to get yourself out of Hong Kong.
"You got to get to one of Doris's safe houses, okay?"
No.
Kono...
"Look, not without Adam."
You're still a target.
They're not gonna take you off their hit list just because they already have Adam.
"I'm not leaving him, Chin."
"Kono, listen to me!"
What good are you gonna be to Adam if you're dead?
"Look, just get yourself out of Hong Kong, okay?"
Let us worry about getting Adam back.
He gave himself up for me.
He sacrificed himself so I could get away.
We will find him.
I promise.
"Now, please, will you do what I'm asking?"
"Cousin, I love you, but I have to do this."
(sniffles)
STEVE:
"Okay, listen."
HPD canvassed the area where our little car thief found the Impala.
"Unfortunately, there's no traffic cameras down there, so we're never gonna know who dropped it off."
What about you?
"I was really eating this, because I use..."
I remember I said that I thought when girls ate in movies it looked fake and like they weren't swallowing.
Like they were just gonna throw...
"Like, barf it into a thing after."
Because usually they give you a bucket to spit stuff out.
I hate when I see it in movies where they're not eating and not swallowing.
- It does get disgusting.
"- Yeah, it was gross."
And I regretted it.
I skipped lunch that day and went and...
I did a scene once where I ate a fig per take.
"And we did it like all day and I was like, ""Why did I do this?"""
Because you can't get out of it once you've started.
And drinking stuff too.
It's hard too.
"Like, if you have a lot of beverage."
Don't get me started about drinking things.
God.
This is a real phone.
"- Oh, boy."
- And in the background...
"There were people in the background, like Rachel Cohn, who wrote the book."
And David Levithan.
"Yeah, where are you?"
Did you leave the city?
- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?
Second and Ninth.
"Okay, well, don't leave."
"I'm gonna come over, okay?"
"In the meantime, could you pass that message on?"
I'm happy about something.
"- It was a reunion, and they were great."
- They're okay.
"A couple of years ago, Mom drove us in to shop."
"She couldn't find a good parking place, and all of the lots were total rip-offs."
So she kept making u-turns and cutting off taxis... and we were being screamed at in so many different languages... that we just turned around and drove home... and bought a Hummel at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.
Very adventurous.
I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.
"So I don't have the lingo down yet, but I have the attitude."
- You do?
- Yeah.
When I was getting a locker for my backpack... at the bus stop there was this guy just standing there staring at me.
"And instead of ignoring him, I fixed him with a really withering stare."
- That I've got to see.
- No.
Come on.
Let me see your withering stare.
It's dangerous.
I could hurt you.
- I've been hurt before.
- No.
I'm disappointed.
"- So, your arm's okay?"
- Yeah.
It looks worse than it is.
I like this Emily chick.
A friend of yours?
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?
I eat here everyday.
"It's nothing fancy, but..."
"In my statement, I told the police that the victim stepped into traffic and that I didn't have enough time to brake, but that was a lie."
The truth is...
I wasn't even looking at the road when it happened.
(crying):
"I was on my phone, reading a text."
"Because of my own carelessness, an innocent man died."
There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.
I'm so sorry.
Got him.
(sobbing):
I wanted to tell his family.
I even wrote the e-mail that I was gonna send.
"But you never did, did you?"
Sorry.
(crying continues)
And now the world will see you for what you really are:
a coward and a liar.
3236.
You're letting me go?
(soft chuckle) No.
"Even if I did, there would be nothing left to go back to, would there?"
But I will show you some mercy.
"(tires screeching, sirens wailing)"
This is Officer Kalakua requesting HPD and SWAT support.
The address is 5625 Hoala Street in Waimalu.

"Whoa, slow down."
"Ok, maybe not that part, as long as we're a couple and I'm her father, I guess, because I love her... and you too, obviously."
"This is unfair, Michael."
"Your life is so hard right now,"
- and I swear I can help with that.
- I can handle things.
- I've been handling things.
"- I know, I know, I know, but I can help with Sophie or cooking or whatever."
I don't want you to have to take care of me anymore.
I wanna help take care of you.
"And if I don't,"
- you can kick me out.
"- Ok, stop it."
"I do not need a father for Sophie and I do not want to get married, oh my God!"
"Ok, that's a bad choice of words and I'm sorry."
"But... child care, yeah."
"And cooking, maybe."
And then...
Maybe we could see what happens.
One step at a time.
Thank you.
You start early.
I'm a professional.
"What I mean by that is I start work early, but I also go home at 5 pm."
I dreamt I fired you last night.
I have that dream quite often.
You'd know that if you transcribed my dictation.
"In these dreams, would I be a projection of some aspect of your personality?"
"Your professionalism, maybe?"
Is that what you were firing?
"I'm not a doctor, but..."
Sometimes dreams are just wish fulfillment.
He didn't say anything interesting at all.
- Huh.
"- So, after 30 years, my dad finally had a chance to sit across from the man who was running everything."
And you know what he saw?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing special.
My dad realized in that moment he could have been that guy sitting behind that desk.
But he realized it too late.
"We're all just a bunch of guys, Joe."
Some of us believe that we could do anything.
And some of us believe we can't.
"So, when you ask me why I wanna do this, my answer is because I know what guy I wanna be."
What about you?
"( clears throat ) I definitely don't wanna be the guy that just lets the clock run out, you know."
I definitely do not wanna be the guy who just sits there while time fucking stands still.
I wanna be the guy.
- The fucking guy?
- Yeah!
"Yeah, the fucking guy."
Then let's get the fuck out of here.
( chuckles ) Holy shit.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- ( chuckles )

It's the parenting.
That's what the hell it is.
"Now, parenting, now I'm not gonna get cliché like every other Black comedian, get on this stage and say you should whup your kids."
"'Cause honestly, I got whipped, and I'm halfway retarded, okay?"
But what you should--
And whupping your kids is not really a good thing to do right now.
Look at Adrian Peterson.
Now what did he really do?
"Okay, he hit his son with a switch."
That's it?
'Cause my mom hit me with... anything she could find.
One time she fucked me up with a Ninja Turtles umbrella.
I couldn't even watch the series anymore.
"Every time the theme music came on,"
I just started having a breakdown and shit.
It'd be...
¶ Teenage Mutant--
"I'd be, ""Ahhh!"""
"And you know, I was a little mischievous when I was a little kid."
"Okay, you know, my pop got me too."
"You know, he in here."
He got me.
"He got me, man."
This one time he beat me in front of the church with drumsticks.
And he was the drummer.
It wasn't even a whipping for him.
It was practice.
"As soon as he was done, he just got back on the stand and just kept doing the same shit just like this here."
"I said, ""You learned that here first."""
"""I'm gonna need some royalties for that shit, you know what I'm saying?"""
It's all good.
"I love my pop, man."
Go ahead!
Go ahead and kill me!
Release my friend and kill me instead!
Stop!
Magistrate!
Magistrate!
What's this commotion?
There's trouble!
What's going on?
Release the innocent man!
Release Yi Soon-shin!
Release him!
Release the innocent man!
"Release Yi Soon-shin and take me instead, you evil bastards!"
"Sir, I have a bad feeling about this."
They might break the gates down and storm inside!
What?
Break down the gates of the government center?
I would advise you to release the prisoner for now.
What?
You want me to give in to those lowly peasants?
"Sir, are you aware about the civil unrest of Pyung-tek two years ago?"
Civil unrest?
The government agency was looted and several officials were stoned to death!
Release Yi Soon-shin!

Did they hurt you?
I'm sorry...
I'm your friend and I let them do this on account of me...

"I think you guys are talking about postpartum depression, and that totally makes sense."
One out of every seven new moms does suffer from it.
"Yeah, no, no, um..."
"You're saying, no, that's not true?"
"I'm worried that, uh..."
Our kid's just gonna have a shit vibe.
"- Sorry, come again?"
- Okay.
I-
"- I'm, like, ehh..."
You know?
"And he's, like, the worst, so I feel like, when we made a baby, so it'll just be like..."
- Her dad's my boss.
- Gotcha.
"So you're not talking about postpartum depression, you're just concerned that your baby's an asshole?"
"Okay, yeah, like, that's what I'm talking about, too."
"- And, like, off of what she said."
- Right.
"I think, just ultimately, we're mostly afraid that he won't be chill."
"Like, what if he can't hang?"
"Or he hangs too hard and has one too many drinks and does that, like, slow-blinking thing."
Let's open it up.

Bats.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Okay, I should have been more specific that I meant fears about the baby."
"Okay, I have a fear about my human baby."
"- Okay, great."
- Um...
I'm really scared that my baby's gonna be blind.
# To be human
# We aren't afraid of anything
# If only we can be human
# We can even sell our souls
# A human
# How great is it?
# To be human
# There's nothing we can't do to them
# To be human
# We can stand anything
# In a world filled with humans
# Where there are more inhumane ones
# Why do we also want to be human?
# What is so great about being human?
# What is so great about it?
# To be human
# We can even sell our souls
# When I see myself in the mirror
# I hate my ugly self
# I want to be human
# To love like a human
# At least for a day
# Could I be happy
# If I stop your heart with my hand
# But I can only be human
# After I kill my love
# I want to be human
# Like an ordinary girl
"# With all my heart after 1,000 years"
# Love like a human
# Love like a human
Is it already time to die?
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
"Yeah, and felony quantity."
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a cheque for $4650.
I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
Four-six-five-zero.
Okay?
"And I need that in a cashier's cheque or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
"And make it out to ""Ice Station Zebra Associates."""
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
"What do I look like, your high-school girlfriend?"
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
Come on.
What do you got?
A lot.
"AUTEC is, like, crazy amazing."
"You've got your Bermuda Triangle, your wormholes, you've got your magnetic field deviations."
Just wish there was a way to contain it all.
You're a mapper.
Oh.
I'm warning you.
You should get out of my head while you still can.
Can you map the bullet back to the shooter?
"Slug that killed Ridgeway, it's 30-caliber, definitely unusual."
The one thing I do know is that it's not military specs.
I'm still trying to track it back to the exact weapon it was fired from.
"Track faster, Abbs."
You know why you're so gruff all the time?
You need more sex.
I'm not answering that.
You just did.
"I am telling you, I saw a bounce in his step."
And Elliott...
"Elliott was sure about Ryan's pupils, as well."
How am I gonna survive Gibbs dating a woman who thinks I'm a game show host?
What does that even mean?
Does she think I'm cheesy?
That I like pencil-thin microphones?
"See, I don't buy it."
Gibbs is a lone wolf.
You have to be observant.
"Next time they come in here, you need to open your eyes and really look."
GIBBS:
"Okay, what are we looking at?"
Grace was fussy all night and sometimes a car ride settles her down.
I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
What am I gonna tell my husband?
"""Need a new car""?"
You're going to feel a little pinprick and then some burning before it kicks in.
You have a bunch of phone messages.
Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
"Oh, crap."
Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
Could you go down to that toy store on Michigan Avenue for me?
You want me to go outside?
Yeah.
It's just a few blocks.
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.
- In the storm?
"- What, you afraid you'll melt?"
What about the lightning?
I'm a pretty big target.
"Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern."
The results are back for that little girl who ejected from the car.
- Is she awake yet?
"- Not yet, but I'm gonna double-check."
Baby's head CT is negative.
- Just some soft tissue swelling.
- Is she awake?
"No, she's still sedated."
Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
This is Bradley Anderson.
His wife and daughter were brought in.
Do that come hither thing.
They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
Now look down.
You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh... no.
There's barely any.
"It's not weird, it's cheap."
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
You see a shovel or a dustpan?
"Mmm, found a scraper."
Looks used.
Sitting on a bucket.
Bucket full of pigeon crap.
Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain."
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.
See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
"Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time."
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
Haven't heard from house yet.
Look at his eeg.
Theta band's been increasing steadily since... since we put him under.
"Guy's unconscious, but still in pain."
Cast off the bow lines.
"We're good to go, first thing."
"Bring her back in one piece, Joe, you're goin' without me."
Did you hear back from the city planner?
Yeah.
She confirmed that viaducts were built over the old rail lines.
What used to be on street level is now a subterranean ghost town.
"Well, Valera and his cohorts must have used that to hide Sara 'cause after we lifted our roadblocks, it would've been easy to move her."
"Yeah, well, we might've identified one of those cohorts."
"This Bluetooth you found, turns out the units are embedded with 48 bit identifiers."
This one's synced to a cell phone.
You got a number?
Better.
I got a name.
Marcy's boyfriend.
Ben Wilson.
- Ben.
- Hey.
I need to know what's going on.
What are you talking about?
Why was there blood on your sweatshirt?
"You took it, didn't you?"
"I need the truth, Ben."
"Believe me, it's better if you don't know."
Don't try to protect me.
I can't stand that.
Okay.
Someone paid me to deliver that money.
Who?
I didn't think it was a big deal.
The delivery went bad.
"A guy got hurt, but it was nothing to do with Sara and it was nothing to do with me."
Grab the steering wheel!
And go!
What do they want?
Stop.
This is the expected behaviour if they wave at us.
It must just be some sort of greeting.
They seem to be evolving in this respect as well.
It seems as if a simple movement of the hand replaced handshakes.
This is how they signal that they aren't carrying weapons.
And what do you know about this?
It must be some sort of routine check.
Prepare your IDs.
There's no point looking in the bag.
It's full of the items related to the fire.
"In the small box, doctor."
"Not a doctor, but a land surveyor."
Five o'clock.
"According to the Memoirs, the Bernaus' house is just starting to burn now."
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Your father and mother are working hard.
"While you... instead of practicing,"
"- But Mum, I was..."
- I don't care.
I know you can always find some excuse.
So.
Take it.
"And now, play something nice."
"There, at the window."
Down there.
Let me hear it.
Fido!
"Go down to your father, and apologize to him."
That's a bad idea.
They're getting away!
That was close.
Bravo.
"Well done, MacGyver."
I knew you'd get us out of that mess.
I always said you're my brightest student.
I'm sorry.
You've every right to be angry with me.
I was wrong.
I was foolish to think that I could control Cleeve.
You almost got us killed!
You must believe me.
I never meant any harm to come to you or Kelly.
"The truth is, I was frightened."
I'd lost my position at the academy.
I was desperate.
"I mean, this is my last chance."
I couldn't bear the thought of losing it.
I thought you hated treasure hunters like Cleeve.
I do.
But finding the Treasure of Atlantis means more than wealth.
"It would prove that Atlantis really did exist and there were times when people didn't live by war and conquest, but worshiped peace and knowledge."
"And if we were like that once, maybe we can be like that again."
It's a nice dream.
I'm convinced that it can become a reality.
"It's a wonderful dream, professor."
But did it ever occur to you that Cleeve might have other plans for the treasure?
Do you think he and Zavros will come after us?
Yes.
"Yes, I do."
The Tower of Fear.
I'm confident that there's no depravity
That brand-new e.
Braun sheets can't erase.
How many problems does Jenny have to cause
Before you realize she's the problem?
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me here.
The library started Did you apply for a documentary internship in Haiti?
Yeah.
The producer just called.
I...
I got the job.
When were you planning on telling me about this?
"This morning,"
"And then you put internships on the ""do not discuss"" list,"
And I panicked.
Why?
Why?
This is not about competing for something.
This is-this is about our relationship.
"But both of those have been so tied up in each other,"
"And this job is a huge deal for me, Dan."
But you can't pretend like you going away for three months
Is not gonna affect us.
I think I didn't wanna face that.
It was just so much easier when we were just friends
And we could talk about things.
"All right, is-is that what you want, then?"
You wanna go back to just friends?
I don't know.
¶
-What are you afraid of?
What he will think?
He loves you.
It would ruin his life marry to a girl who...
"Doc, you know not a respectable person in town would accept him."
Respectable!
What kind of respectability are you talking about?
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life!
Prison can be a kind of dying!
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"-Besides, you mustn't get involved."
"-Now, never mind about me."
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please, promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
"Selena, you don't seem to realized."
You face a possible life sentence!
-I need much more to work with.
-There is no more.
"Lucas was drunk, brutal."
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in seIf-defense is understandable... but you hid the body and acted like a criminal.
-I know.
-But she was fighting for her life!
The State is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
"He's competent, relentless as the law itself."
"Yes, tell her to come in."
There must be something you haven't told me.
lt`s not predictable
"No color, no face, long life to stay!"
l`m the supreme of the world !
Who is it?
My dear sister
We all rely on you !
Soul Changing Stance
"I feel dizzy, I can`t stand it anymore lt`s cheap!"
Who do you want to scare?
Don`t you think such chain ...
... canlockme up ?
"lt`s not for locking you , it`s used to connect the lightning-rod"
"You said , we will enjoy ourselves on a stormy night l`ll let you try a wonderful thunder storm"
Don`t move!
Fly...
Flying ...
Fa...
Fairy
"1 , 2 , 3, 4 5 lt`s right here"
The thunder hit Fat
So it transform his cells
"During the process, he gained extra power"
"So, he can release the power of Flying Fairy"
"At that moment, it seems that there was a flying fairy in the sky lsn`t it illusion caused by air crash , or am I drunk?"
Of course you are drunk
"So, you have drunk much more than me I am drunk everyday lt`s strange, why hasn`t Fat come to work?"
"Brother Fat, where are you?"
We can`t live without you
"Brother Fat, where are you?"
"Hubby, it`s so great!"
Your new invention let us fly freely in the sky
Let us name it...
Star power!
Yes!
"Sctanley, no!"
Yeah!
You hustled me.
"Yes, I did."
"For that, I'm sorry."
"You see, I sell video games, Sctanley."
"And this one here, in particular, in fact."
And I'm proud to stand here before you and tell you it brings me as much happiness as it does for the people I provide them to.
"And we had a bet, and I know that you're a man of your word."
Forget that you saw me and my friends and point me in the direction that I seek.
I cannot confirm or deny that the one that you seek is on the singles' side.
But a bet is a bet.
And I will tell you how to get there.
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.
No more boats for me and my friends.
I go by foot.
I would be remiss if I did not advise you to wait until daylight.
Do not take this journey lightly.
Hmm.
"There is an old game path through the forest, just beyond the abandoned Starbucks."
Take it to where it forks.
Jog to the right.
Do not go to the left.
You will see lights.
You don't want to go there.
Keep walking.
Look up and locate the belt of Orion the Hunter.
I think we should be writing this down.
I think Dave's got it.
- Madam.
- What is it?
What are you doing here?
Please take me in.
I do not wish to invite trouble by taking in Master Yi's man.
Leave.
But you promised you'd take me in.
The situation has changed.
I must break that promise.
I mean to sever my ties with Master Yi.
You don't have to...
that tie is already severed.
The master is dead.
What do you mean he's dead?
Jang Bogo attacked and took the master's life.
Is Yum Moon also dead?
He wasn't at the base at the time of attack.
Please...
...take me in.
"If you don't take me, I've no place to go."
How can I trust a man who ran away to save his own life when his master is dead?
What?
Who's to say you won't betray your master again?
That will never happen.
I will give my life for you.
I will give you a chance to prove your loyalty.
Say anything.
I will do anything.
We need to recruit more people.
What do you plan to do by hiring more people when we should be letting people go to survive Madam Jami's advances?
I will send merchants all over Shilla.
I will trade cotton and salt at marketplaces where Madam Jami's influence hasn't reached.
Do you honestly think the other factions will stand for this?
Because you're so popular?
Get her out of here.
"When that message gets out, it'll be the end."
What message?
You'll see.
I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
We have separated you from the rest of us.
And we created factions to ensure peace.
The time has come to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.
We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.
But you're not.
"If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded."
"Mankind waits for you, with hope, beyond the wall."
(MUSIC PLAYING)
These will be the Divergent.
They are the true purpose of this experiment.
They are vital to humanity's survival.
You did it.
- Yeah.
-Yeah.
Everyone's staring at me.
You changed everything.
(SIGHS) What now?
Only one way to find out.
You ready?
It's been over 200 years.
Who knows what's out there?
You'll never find out.
(GUNSHOT)
"hen the most important thing for us at that stage for some reason, in our minds, was:"
What are we gonna wear?
So ridiculous.
e hadn't even thought of a name.
We didn't even know if we could sing together.
"NiaII did say, ""We all need to dress a bit like Louis."""
NiaII looked at Louis' shoes.
He was quite cool.
""" I Iike his shoes."
"We should wear his shoes."""
Green polo.
We like those jeans.
Let's all wear those jeans.
I Iook back on it now.
If we'd have dressed like that.... e first got together at Harry's dad's place.
e did not know each other at all.
e'd get together and sing a few songs in the nighttime around the campfire.
e were meant to be rehearsing but we actually ended up playing football.
Most of the time we just spent having a laugh really.
e were lik e.
""" Let's just have fun."""
"Let's just have fun and, Iike, see what happens."
t was vital that we made friends before we became colleagues.
The first act through on the public votes is:
One Direction.
Love you!
Outside the studio they've only sang once.
here's now 200 fans.
"And I thought at the time, ""This is unusual."
"This just doesn't happen after one performance."""
The crowds were starting to build outside the studio.
"Harry, get a picture with me!"
I knew Jess Mclntyre would help you.
"- They're helping us, ain't they?"
"- Yes, sir!"
"- Retha, give them boys more chicken."
"- Yes, ma'am."
"You're all very kind, kinder than we deserve."
That's right.
[Innkeeper] You won't have no trouble at all.
"Once folks find out what you're up to, they'll put the big pot in the little one."
"[Innkeeper] Well, look who's here!"
"[Retha] Land sakes, but you're wet!"
"You need some of Retha's cooking, Mr. Andrews."
Sounds mighty good.
Smells even better.
I think I'll get warm first.
Evening.
"[Innkeeper] Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews that peach brandy, you hear?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news."
"On the strength of it, I'd ask you all to have a glass with me... if I knew the color of your politics."
You needn't worry about these boys.
"They've been living amongst Yankees, but they're coming out on the right side."
Good.
We won a great victory at Shiloh.
- Did Beauregard lick that buzzard Grant?
- [Andrews] Cut him to ribbons.
What about the Yankee gunboats at Pittsburgh Landing?
"100 of them sunk, and thousands of prisoners taken."
"The whole Yankee force, gone up the spout."
[cheers]
Isn't that wonderful?
Ladies and gentlemen...
"Look down, look down"
There's 20 years to go
I've done no wrong
"Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!"
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
Sweet Jesus doesn't care
CONVICTS:
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
They've all forgotten you
When I get free
You won't see me Here for dust!
CONVICTS:
Huh!
"Look down, look down"
You'll always be a slave
"Look down, look down"
You're standing in your grave
Retrieve the flag.

(THUDDING)
"(SINGING) Now, Prisoner 24601"
Your time is up And your parole's begun
You know what that means?
Yes.
It means I'm free
No.
Follow to the letter Your itinerary
This badge of shame You'll show it till you die
- Julie's webcam.
"It would be too bad if this film were to go around court, wouldn't it?"
"What do you mean, go around?"
"To avoid that, you need to help us."
What kind of help?
- Working for us.
Tell us exactly where Roban is in the Villedieu case.
I can't.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
"Speaking of secrets, you know that Julie is underage?"
"That's crazy, she's in the first year of law school!"
Look.
She's in high school.
You see?
"Must admit, she is pretty talented for a 15-year-old."
"If you refuse to help us, within 30 minutes this film will be sent to every magistrate's mailbox."
"When they realise the girl is underage, they won't do you any favours."
And you will be disbarred for life.
"Harsh, isn't it?"
Gilou!
Tintin!
What's going on?
The Crime Squad has found the guy Gilou argued with at the squat.
How do you know?
- I just know.
"If the guy talks, they'll be able to get to Patricia."
"- Knowing her, she'll talk."
- The Crime Squad can't implicate Gilou.
- The bullet doesn't come from his gun.
"- Wait, Bremont isn't stupid."
He'll know we covered up for Gilou if Patricia says she was with him.
He'll realise I tampered with the seal.
I don't know.
Perhaps a little.
"Dear, why don't you go up and change so we can have dinner?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
I'll wash and then we'll eat.
"Oh, hey."
"Will you stay for dinner, Sam?"
"Well, I was."
"Thank you, John."
That'd be nice.
Didn't you tell him I was coming to dinner?
"Doctor, it was his idea to invite you tonight."
I reminded him just this morning.
I can hardly believe it.
"Why, his memory is phenomenal."
How long has he been like this?
It's been months.
"I kept trying to get him to see you, but he wouldn't."
"I begged him to take it easy, retire, but he just goes into a rage."
"What's wrong with him, Doctor?"
"Well, it certainly can't be anything physical."
I gave him a thorough checkup only a few weeks ago.
Would you object to having a specialist examine him?
A specialist?
What do you mean?
I mean a psychiatrist.
You don't think he's...
"Now, now, now, don't jump to conclusions."
It may be nothing more than just mental fatigue.
But I do think you should take him to see Dr. Croatman as soon as possible.
"Now, there, there, there."
Good morning.
"Okay, I'm ""fight"" too."
I hit you on the way out.
Do you really not see the problem here?
"Okay, I don't know what it is, okay?"
This is all I know.
It's like I was raised by wolves.
"No, you weren't."
Wolves stay in a pack.
You know what?
"Look, I guess it's fine, it's just, when it comes to emergency situations,"
I'm on my own.
"Come on, that is not true, all right?"
We are a team.
We're like Sonny and Cher.
"Cher left Sonny, and then Sonny died."
"On a Mountain, in an emergency."
"I think Jack Daniels is a racist, because he does not get along with Jose Cuervo."
"Oh, come on, it's 11:00, we've got to move or we're going to be late for our emotional cooking class."
"Okay, Lil, you know what, we've been on a three day bender."
"Going out and drinking all night, and doing stuff off daily candy all day."
"I mean, I never thought I'd say this, but..."
I actually miss being alone with my thoughts.
I don't.
We're having so much fun.
"Okay, Lil, I'm tired, all right?"
"I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore."
I think I'm too old to be an alcoholic.
"And I am definitely too old to be grinding teenagers in ""da club."""
"Oh, well, that's okay."
"I mean, there's plenty we can do without drinking."
Can I just say three words to you?
Architectural boat tour.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy, with a hook, and he lived in a mirror."
"And if you even looked at him, you'd wake up in a bathtub full of ice, with your kidneys gone."
Whoa.
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- What?
"- You name the terms, I name the place."
"OK, fine!"
Where we gonna do this?
Castle Duloc?
"Ha, ha, very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived.
Ja!
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
"Now, wait a minute!"
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging into some creepy, spookyjoint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
I'm getting a whole creepy House of wax vibe going on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine Now is all rundown
Stop!
"Don't stop us, Admiral!"
If we are criminals of treason what does that make our men?
We are not treasonous rebels!
Kill them!
Kill them!
"What are you waiting for, Admiral?"
Arrest these men now!
"Admiral, what do we have to lose at this point?"
Let us slay these men and change this world!
What?
Or I will slay these men and take my own life!
Admiral!
Very well.
I will slay these men and march to the capital!
Admiral!
Put down your swords!
"Are you intent on becoming a traitor, Admiral?"
A traitor?
Did you say a traitor?
The Japanese killed your father and took your mother.
Is that correct?
Admiral...
Your sister hung herself after being raped by an enemy soldier.
Isn't that right?
"Yes, Admiral!"
Chun Woo-song!
This man's infant son starved to death next to his mother.
Do you know why?
Because the Japanese killed his mother by cutting off her breasts!
Now do you understand?
This is why we can't stop fighting.
"- All right, guvnor."
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
"- You're sure of that, Sergeant?"
"- As sure as taxes, guvnor."
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
"If you have, there'll be worse than lashes."
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"""Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."""
"That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat!"
"Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant."
You're simply a victim of superior strategy.
"Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!"
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
"Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper."
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that.
Ready?
- Right.
"- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door."
- Right.
"Mac, take your coat."
Right.
Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
"No, you won't."
He went to meet Mary.
"All right, let's go check out the Larimar."
"I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it."
"Okay, well, you did at one point."
Mary would never force anyone into this.
Why did you do it in the first place?
I work in the ICU.
I deal with the heaviest shit in the hospital...
"People at their worst, their most desperate."
"Before Mary, there was only so much I could do for them."
"Handing them that pamphlet, it gave them..."
- Comfort.
- Yeah.
Also I want a million dollars.
"Uh, what?"
I have financial goals.
How much do you have so far?
"Oh, come on, I'm not gonna rob you."
It's too much work.
- Not enough.
- Enough for what?
Freedom.
So you're breaking the law for freedom?
"The law is wrong, and it will change."
"Until then, there's no reason that I shouldn't supplement my income."
Then why stop?
I have this vision.
"Me, Mary, and now you, all of us in the woods somewhere, like a camp."
"No, a retreat."
A death retreat.
"People come from all over the world to experience the finest death possible, from the best of the best."
Sounds kind of nice.
Striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people.
- Bordering between autism...
- Stop.
"You know, I didn't always do this."
This is my first station assignment.
I was on the other end of the numbers.
Looking at nine million black-book tax dollars.
Recruited me straight out of college.
Said it was the best opportunity I'd ever have.
"Told me I'd do special things, important things."
"Well, you're worth more than what some bureaucrat wrote down on a piece of paper 20 years ago."
All they're really talking about is what's real.
Reality.
They know how to use it.
They're good at it.
Why not quit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I knew a guy once, and he decided he wanted to quit."
"He squirreled away money for about 20 years and he opened up a bar and wanted to create a new life, and he survived about 37 months."
They killed him?
"No, I did."
See if you can get into those files.
Emerson gets here.
Get off me!
Get the fuck off!
Get it off me!
- How much longer?
- Little while still.
"Go on, David, tell her to come out."
Tell her to come out right now!
Fuck you!
Rescue Force Sigma-17 reporting for duty.
I was not aware rescue teams were... still active.
"Wherever there is an emergency, there are rescue bots, sir."
"Hey, why wouldn't we be active?"
How long were we in stasis?
We better check it with Cybertron H.Q.
That will not be necessary.
Or possible.
Cybertron is no longer our home.
This planet is.

"Hi, mister Harrison!"
I'm OK!
"Cody Burns, Griffin Rock PD."
"Please, pull over."
Figured you wanna say goodbye to the old rust bucket.
It's her last day on the job.
"I still don't understand why the city is making you get a new car, Dad."
- This one works fine.
"- Progress, kiddo."
It wouldn't be high-tech testing ground if we stayed back.
"Give it up, Dad."
"If Cody had his way, we all would be paddling everywhere."
"'Course you'd still be on training wheels, Kade."
The helmet may mess up your hair.
"Quit it, Graham."
Don't forget to be at the dedication this afternoon.
Think I can test-drive the hotty.
"We're getting rescue vehicles, no go-carts."
"Sorry, pal."
For authorised emergency responders only.
"So basically, everyone in the family but me."
I'm really afraid that our son is going to... be on those dating apps and that his profile pic will be him wearing those new year's glasses where the numbers are the eyes.
Oh...
"And what if he does something totally unforgivable, like rape?"
"Or, um..."
DJ'ing?
"Dads, you need to talk to your sons and say, don't DJ."
It starts in the home.
These are all really valid fears.
"Look, your kids, they are gonna grow up to be pieces of shit and they will hate you."
But here's the thing.
All of you are also pieces of shit.
You really are.

"- What's wrong, Amy?"
- Nothing.
"- Oh, okay."
"- No, I'll tell you."
I got stuck on another awkward date last night.
"It's, like, you know in two seconds if the guy is wrong for you, but you still have to sit there through the whole dinner."
You need to try the website I'm on.
It keeps dating super casual.
I already tried It's Just Lunch.
It was still awkward.
I'm off that.
I'm talking about It's Just a Quick What's Up.
- It's Just a Quick What's Up?
- Yeah.
"When a guy decides he wants to briefly meet you, he'll send you a no-presh, super cash ""slight nod""."

"And I'd especially like to welcome all of our grandparents, our parents and special friends-"
- Hi.
"I know those pancakes are tasty, but this event is really about raising money for our children and our school."
Remember our theme:
"""You can't take it with you, and we'd love to have it."""
I'm really glad you let me come.
"Yeah, me too."
So is this considered our third date?
Because I brought my batting glove.
Your mother looks like she's having a good time.
"No, she's just had so many face lifts, her mouth is stuck that way."
The kids call her the Joker.
I think it upsets her.
How can you tell?
"Oh, hey, look-- it's Christine."
Who's she with?
Is that her dad?
It must be.
"Wow, he's so handsome and well-dressed."
"Oh, she must take after her mother."
"Oh, God, that's good."
"You know, sometimes, I wish I was the funny one and you were the pretty one."
I think those two women are staring at us.
"Ugh, ignore them."
Those are the meanie moms.
They're awful-- all they do is judge everyone and gossip.
Should I step away?
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?
"Because if you'd rather be with one of the other grandfathers,"
I completely understand.
"Yes, of course!"
Tomorrow.
"Yes, madam."
Yes.
Goodbye.
In Peru prostitutes and drug addicts were arrested.
Many of those arrested are teenagers who inhale glue.
"Ready, madam."
"- Thank you, Guille, see you next week."
Where are we going?
- To see Beto.
"Good morning, Beto."
"- Good morning, madam."
Open the curtains.
"- Yes, madam."
Friday they are coming to see the house.
"- Yes, madam, I will be here."
"Here, Beto, these are from last month."
"Thanks, I didn't have anything to read."
Trick or treat?
I didn't realize it was Halloween.
Do you want to see a real monster?
Violence in Bangladesh left 50 people injured.
Hundreds of demonstrators demanding electoral reform were evacuated with teargas and beaten by the police.

"In Australia, over a hundred soldiers had to..."
I don't think they'll sell it.
- When do you think it'll get sold?
"It would be a miracle, it's been so long..."
Don't you get bored?
- No.
Can you come tonight?
Further than that.
Do not believe.
Is love a fancy or a feeling?
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.
"""I do not deny that I think very highly of him."""

We are so happy that you invited Edward to Norland.
We're all very fond of him.
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.
And in marriage.
She's determined both he and Robert will marry well.
But I hope she desires them to marry for love.
The heart doesn't always lead us in the most suitable direction.
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.
Having entered into an understanding he would never go back on his word.
But it would lead to his ruin.
I'm worried.
Mother will withdraw all financial support from him -
- Should he plant affection in less exalted ground than he deserves.
I understand you perfectly.
Devonshire?
"My cousin, Sir John Middleton, has offered us a small house."
He must be a man of property.
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.
A cottage?
Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.
- What a good idea.
"- This Friday, already."
- I think that's a wise decision.
- You can't cope with this.
"- No, it's pointless."
- You can help move her there.
- Of course.
"One wiener, one frankfurter and one with bacon."
- Why didn't you eat any lunch?
- Bodil turns me off food.
The mentally handicapped turn me off food.
One or two rolls?
Lots of people feel that way.
"When I have handicapped customers, they scare all the others away."
- They need to eat too.
- But does it have to be when we eat?
- She'll be fine there.
- The Gimp needs to get rid of her.
He can't bring girls home with her sitting there.
He had sex with her the other day and she just lay there.
He didn't know if she enjoyed it.
"Technically, he could be raping her."
Scary thought.
"It sure makes you appreciate what you've got, honey."
- Appreciate your own good sex life.
- We've got no complaints.
"Good God, no."
I think if we take all of Copenhagen   we're in the top five percent.
"Honestly, honey, is there anything I could do better?"
"Well, maybe just in the oral department."
- Do I give you bad oral sex?
- I didn't say that.
It's irresponsible.
"I, it's not definite I have the same thing."
I think you know it's the same.
You told the doctor you recognized it.
That's what the next three years of your marriage look like.
"You'll have to feed her, bathe her, and attend to her most personal hygiene."
"My god, what have I got myself into?"
"Philip, calm down."
Calm down?
Have you read this?
She'll have spasms every day.
Then there's the infections and the bed sores...
"Oh, stop, stop!"
I can't handle it!
"Philip, there are nurses, hospices..."
Hospices won't take her until the very end.
"Until then, she'll be your 24/7 responsibility."
All the sounds and smells of her disintegration.
"God, this insentient, incontinent lump of flesh."
I can't be around it!
I can't!
"What a prince, huh?"
He'll get over it.
He'll take care of me.
In sickness and in health.
I have the room picked out.
It's a very beautiful room.
He already thinks that you blackmailed him into marriage.
- That's not true.
- He's gonna let you die alone.
His own wife?
It'd get out.
Bloody man.
Sooner or later he's going to make somebody drop something.
"Back, keep back."
"Come on, make way."
"Come on, move back."
(People clamouring)
Back!
"Come on, move!"
Keep back!
"Come on, move."
Back!
HOWARD:
Get out of the way!
Keep back and don't touch anything!
"- Adamson, get these people back!"
"- Yes, sir."
"This is ridiculous, sir."
They're all behaving as if this was some sort of bloody fairground attraction.
Have you any idea how many people were here yesterday?
"12,000. 12,000!"
"I mean, where in God's name are they all coming from?"
It's making work quite impossible and it's only a matter of time before there's an accident.
"I think it's something we have to put up with, old man."
The amount of interest this thing has generated is quite extraordinary.
I've been giving interviews all morning.
"We're front page news, Howard."
Hmm.
"Well, no one's spoken to me."
"If they had, I'd have told them to bugger off."
Did I tell you His Majesty has asked me to Buck House for lunch to tell him all about it?
"What's this, do you suppose?"
It's a shabti figure.
And I got lucky.
"I had an apartment downtown, but home was City Hall."
That's where it all began.
"The day started out like other days, with a ceremonial function."
The mayor was giving the key to the city to the governor of Tokyo.
- He liked soup for breakfast.
Fish soup.
My dad offered to put it on the menu.
"But, ""No, no,"" Mr. Hayatama said who was a very gentle soul."
"""No, it would be too much trouble."""
"My dad replied, ""Too much trouble is no customers."""
"The mayor, and he was the best mayor the city ever had, was my boss."
I was his deputy mayor.
His right-hand man.
Or his boy  depending on who was talking about me.
But in Brooklyn  something else was going on that would change everything.
"It started with a cop  Eddie Santos, the toughest detective in Brooklyn North."
"He was on his way to a meeting with Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer  whose only distinction was being a nephew to Paul Zapatti, a mafia boss."
"James Bone, a child on his way to school."
Watch your step.
"Finally, Vinnie Zapatti, cousin to Tino  a rat Detective Eddie Santos had in his pocket."
- All set?
- Let's go.
It happened on the corner of Broadway and Marcy in North Brooklyn.
- You ain't going out in no playground.
- Please?
"- No, it's raining too hard."
"- Oh, man."
Here comes our boy.
Get out of the car.
You said you wouldn't take him in.
Just want to talk with him.
I wish it would have been so.
That would be better than the truth.
Ash-393 took it from the womb of your broken wife.
He took it with him.
No one knows where.
"We could not tell you the truth that time, but..."
"But if he had left, a Noid kidnapped a human baby..."
We would have genocidal panic above our heads.
You're telling me?
...
That my son still lives?
"Yes, Bishop."
But the most important:
We're giving you a chance to get them back.
Find Ash.
Then you will find your daughter.
My daughter...
"Our daughter, Mara!"

"And the guy in the German hell, covered in shit up to his ears, asks the guy in the Spanish hell how he's doing..."
I don't know what I'm doing telling jokes.
Not knowing what the Nazis are doing with Amelia.
"Continue the joke, I beg you."
The Spaniard says he's living pretty well in the Spanish hell.
"The German, dumbfounded, asks him:"
"""Don't they throw buckets of shit on you?""."
"And the Spaniard says: ""In Spanish hell when there's a bucket, there's no shit, and when there's shit, there's no bucket""."
Well I don't understand.
Fine.
I guess Spain's changed a lot since the 16th century.
"For the worse, as I see it."
It seems that they are here.
Let's go.
Could you shut up for once?
I'm sick of all your blabbering!
What are you doing?

Full ammo loads.
- They're coming from the north.
- We're gonna setup a rescue party ?
No.
We don't have the manpower.
We have to defend the position.
"- Lee, she could be dying out there."
"- Yeah, I know that, Sam."
"But we are thin on the ground here, and the cylons are on the march."
We can't help her.
We have to hold our positions.
Are you out of your frakkin' mind ?
"We just picked up 6 heavy Raiders falling away from the cylon fleet, definitely heading toward the planet."
I don't get it.
- They'd have to know we see them.
- They're testing us.
Want to know if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.
"Unfortunately, we are bluffing."
Are we ?
- Mr. Hoshi.
"- Aye, sir."
Order nuclear ground-strike missiles in the launch tubes four through ten.
"Aye, sir."
This is a nuclear mission order.
The major's right.
We don't have any troops to spare if we're gonna hold this position.
Screw this position !
We can take those hills.
Use guerilla tactics.
That's I've been talking about.
"No, that is not the mission."
We have our orders.
Science is changing the way women age.

Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's running it.
We got to get off this boat.
"Oh, you want to get off the boat?"
"Then what do we do, huh?"
Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
That'll add weeks to the trip.
Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
"They got eyes on you right now, son."
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.
Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Glass knows this territory best.
It's his job to get us home safe.
Get us home safe?
"""Oh, yeah, white,"""
"we can make Eminem, how 'bout that?"

"Garlic, he wants to make a pizza."

I understand him.
"I like Eminem, man."
Eminem is dope.
I like lyricists.
I like people that actually rap.
"Kendrick, J. Cole, Drake,"
Leave that magazine here.
Hello?
"Ah, it's you."
Were you expecting someone more exciting?
Where have you been until this late hour?
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Do you want to meet me in the afternoon?
I've something I need to talk to you about.
It's very important.
"OK, have you bought that stuff I asked you to buy?"
What's that?
That stuff.
"Ah, condoms?"
"Yes, I bought them."
"Hey, what are you going to tell me tomorrow?"
"Oh, my wife is coming."
See you.
Your bath's ready.
Don't you have to get up early for a game of golf with your clients?
Early bed?
Yes.
Have you become one of those old men who read these kind of magazines?
You must be kidding.
One of my colleagues at work loves this kind of stuff and he gave me this one saying it was the best.
"Pornography in Japan is totally tasteless, isn't it?"
She's very pretty.
Doesn't she look just like those girls who work in your department store?
We haven't taken a bath together for so long.
Why don't we do that tonight?
"Are you going to wash me, then?"
That girl in the magazine.
That pretty girl. I've seen her.
Thank you.
"Howard, Homicide."
"Hey, Beth."
Lunch tomorrow?
"Sure, what time?"
Fire inspector?
"She knows the bar, says it won't be a problem but she can't get here till next week."
Building inspector?
A slight snag.
He's sick.
He's scheduled to do the tour 8:00am Thursday if his rabies clears up.
Health inspector?
I'm meeting him tomorrow at 10:00am.
He's nice.
I dated his sister once.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
All of these bureaucrats have to sign off before we can buy the bar?
That's how it works.
Why can't they just have one guy come down and check out everything?
I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe in less government.
"There's too much regulation, there's too many shackles and business should be free of these kinds of restraints."
"Anyway, what do I know?"
I'm just a silent partner.
Does he seem silent to you?
- Coffee?
"- Yeah, thanks."
"Sometimes after these marathon shifts, I get these coffee headaches, and the only way to get rid of them is to drink more coffee."
How about I buy?
Buy?
"It's the squad's coffee, it's free."
"I'd still like to buy, huh?"
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
"Henry, shut the door."
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
"I remember feeling bad about the guy,"
But I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
You're a real jerk.
You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
I don't know what the hell's wrong with you.
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decided to take on a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
"He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time, but he was already a legend."
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd shove hundreds in the pockets of the dealers and all the guys that ran the games.
"I mean, the bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold."
The Irishman is here to take all you Guineas' money.
-Want a drink?
-Give me a Seven and Seven.
Jimmy. I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Pleasure.
Thank you.
Tomorrow night.
He didn't tell me that when I spoke to him.
"Well, he got hung up."
And he didn't know he was going to get hung up when he talked to you on the phone.
(SIGHING)
"Well, we'll wait for him."
"We can't do that, we can't wait, we got to go."
No.
We'll wait till tomorrow.
We'll stay here.
"Pluto, I don't think that's such a good idea."
"We don't have much room, and, uh... (CRACKING KNUCKLES)"

I've slept on the couch before.
"Fuck you, Beaver."
I'm not moving.
Give me the phone.
"I swear to God, sometimes I don't think you got a fucking brain in your head."
"Ray, I'm going to Star City."
"The only reason why I got involved in this shit was because you promised me we'd get some money, that I could go home and see my people."
"Yeah, well, that's before all this shit happened, wasn't it?"
It's about time we got where we're going.
I don't see what the problem is.
All y'all got to do is come through and pick me up.
It's on the way.
RAY:
"You know goddamn well that Pluto's not going to do that, don't you?"
You heard what the man said.
I think it's a good idea.
"If she goes ahead of us, it will be safer to travel."
I don't think you'll find anything.

I'm Dr. Larson.
"You're in possession of illegally acquired tech, a cardiac regulator."
"Serial number, 928-H4W."
It was reactivated against our consent.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I drove by the park earlier.
"You said you were gonna be there with the kids, you know."
And I... stopped and watched you for a minute.
I didn't spot you.
No?
"Well, lucky you're not a detective."
Lucky you're not a comedian.
What d'you think?

I'm not much on refresher courses.
"Well, the first day, he writes on the blackboard,"

That's good advice.

Of course not.

"You don't understand, arsehole."
We found the garage thanks to Jésus.
"Now that we all agree the Mexican killed Karine and Célia, we need to find Niko, Tatiana's probable killer."
"We know he is a pimp, probably Albanian, with a scar on the cheek."
He has girls working near the Canal de I'Ourcq.
"Without Jésus, he will be difficult to identify, so keep your eyes open."
The Crime Squad should not have the info on Niko.
We're ahead of them.
We're pretty sure that Ronaldo taught Niko his MO to carve up Tatiana.
Niko could then tell Jésus how to mutilate her.
And Tatiana then becomes a victim of the Butcher of la Villette.
And Ronaldo gets freed.
- Niko and Ronaldo know each other?
Yes.
It's the only explanation.
But we're not 100% sure.
"Ronaldo had no visitors in jail, except his lawyer."
Now what's important is how to catch Ronaldo before he kills a new victim.
"He fooled the cops, the judge..."
He must feel invincible.
It's pretty certain he will do it again.
"Yes, but he's on the run."
And running isn't cheap.
"He needs money, documents."
He has no one else but Niko.
John F. Kennedy?
Jon Bon Jovi?
Jon Bon Jovi.
Too easy.
"And, if I may say so, a complete load of bollocks."
"In my opinion, all men are islands."
"And what's more, now's the time to be one."
This is an island age.
"A hundred years ago, you had to depend on other people."
No one had TV or CDs or DVDs or videos or home espresso makers.
"Actually, they didn't have anything cool."
"Whereas now, you see you can make yourself a little island paradise."
"With the right supplies and the right attitude you can be sun-drenched, tropical, a magnet for young Swedish tourists."
"Hi, it's Kristina."
I haven't heard from you.
I had a great time last weekend.
"So give me a call, okay?"
'Bye.
And I like to think that perhaps I am that kind of island.
I like to think I'm pretty cool.
I like to think I'm Ibiza.
There were people who had a good time in life.
I was beginning to realize I wasn't one of them.
I just didn't fit.
I didn't fit at my old school.
I definitely didn't fit at my new one.
I heard that some kids got taught by their parents at home.
"Mum couldn't do that, unless I paid her to teach me."
Because it was just her and me.
And she went to work.
She made £400 a week.
Where was I gonna get that kind of money from?
"Okay, gang, take off the mustaches."
"Now, what is it, Schulz?"
"Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva man is coming to inspect the camp and find out whether we are living up to the international convention."
I'm sure he will find that we are treating you very well.
"Now, you must not run around in your underwear."
And take off the wash.
The kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
"Ja, we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs."
The kommandant also sends you clean blankets.
He wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
"Yeah, yeah, we know."
We had them last year.
"Five minutes after the Geneva man was gone, the blankets were gone."
"Uh, the kommandant also told me to pick up the radio."
Radio?
"What radio, Schulz?"
"The one you are hiding in the barracks, don't you know?"
The one your friend mit out the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
"Schulz, you're off your nut."
- Give me the radio.
-No radio.
"All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself."
"Now, let's see."
Where could it be?
Maybe...
Maybe in the lieutenant's bunk?
"Oh, no, not in the lieutenant's bunk."
I'm cold here.
Maybe warmer on this side.
In the piccolo may--
"Oh, no, not in the piccolo."
Am I getting warmer?
- You know.
- Are you kidding me?
You know what?
"Forget it, okay?"
I'm gonna do this by myself.
"I'm gonna go find some classy, sophisticated people who can hold their booze, who don't talk about their bleached assholes, and who aren't obsessed with poop."
"Okay, bring me up to speed here, boys."
This is an interesting piece.
I love his use of space.
The space... that's what I loved about it.
What do you think the chunky earth tones represent?
"Look at the rich texture, the dimensions."
It's almost as if you can smell it.
"Oh, God..."
This is the piece I was telling you about.
"It's unbelievable... and so raw, so base, so utterly human."
It's almost as if it exploded out of the artist.
Well...
I think it's crap.
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
You know what?
"Guys, let's just wrap up the evidence and start again fresh tomorrow."
"You think they'll keep, or should we put them in the fridge?"
They'll keep fine.
You know what?
"You guys win, all right?"
Are you happy?
Win what?
Heart failure!
"Therefore, as a senior council member,"
I declare we can no longer entrust the affairs of our nation to him.
President Choi Eung Chan... will be impeached!
Mr. President...
Congress has agreed on your impeachment.
I couldn't protect you...
I'm Sorry.
It's okay...
"Actually, I feel free."
It should've been sooner.
It had to turn out like this.
What is this?
These people were asked to pass the Private School Reform Bill... and accepted bribes.
Stand them up.
Bring them in.
It has been revealed that these Congressman accepted bribes in exchange for passing the Private School Reform Bill.
Evidence has been found and an investigation is underway.
It looks like he's going to be impeached.
Those punks...
"Well, since they betrayed the citizens..."
"Where are you going, Yoon Sung?"
I'm going to Father.
"Kim Na Na, you're on duty tomorrow, aren't you?"
"Since we're in an emergency situation right now, be prepared for when a decision comes forth."
"Chief, I'm not on duty tomorrow."
You are on duty.
Did you get something wrong?
I'm not.
I wrote on my schedule...
Mr. President's seven-day guarding schedule.
Mr. President...
Hello?
Why did you come in?
You should have called me.
I'm not taking advantage of you?
- You've done three nights this week.
- Don't worry.
If I have one afternoon free that's enough.
I have to talk to the builders about the apartment.
It's in such a mess.
Then I just have to get a photo framed.
My situation won't improve.
Maybe we should tell the clinic and let them decide.
"Look, your husband walked out on you and the kids."
"You come the nights you can, and I'll do the rest."
Between us we'll manage.
Thank you.
- You stopped the intravenous nutrition.
- She didn't tolerate it.
- We can try again tomorrow.
- Yes.
"Now, go on."
- And cheer up.
- Thanks.
Six bulls and one woman.
"Next Wednesday, in the traditional bullring in Brihuega,"
Lydia Gonzalez is going to fight six bulls!
"- That's a lot of bulls, Lydia."
- Good evening.
Why such a drastic decision?
My job is to fight bulls.
"Two bulls, six, whatever they say."
People say a lot of bullfighters won't fight with you because you're a woman.
People can say what they want.
I can only take so much of this!
Are you going to drink your life away?
Go home if you're not going to drink with me.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
"I know you're hurt, but this is too much."
It's just a darn exam.
You never wore a scholar's robe before anyway.
Stay out of my life.
How could I?
Who are you to tell how to live my life?
Who am I?
How could you say such a heartless thing?
I'm your friend salt merchant Yim Chun-su.
"A friend, yes, we're friends..."
Come to think of it.
We make a fine pair.
You're a peasant's son and I am a traitors son.
We make a fine pair.
Are you done?
Is that why you're my friend?
Because you're poor and your grandfather was a traitor?
Are you saying you wouldn't have been my friend if you came from a rich and powerful clan?
Fine then.
Do what you want.
You can drink yourself to death for all I care!
Would you pour me a glass of that?
Is it hard to bear?
I'm glad.
I'm glad this happened to me and not to Yo-shin.
Ten years...
For ten years this river has been the source of comfort.
And in that time I had put it all behind.
She was just Fanny.
Fatimah Fareeeha Taarhira al-Amatullah.
Not at all like the kind of girl you'd meet back in Illinois?
"Actually, sir, not that different."
When did you find out she was a princess?
"When I asked her on a date, sir."
She told me she wasn't allowed to be seen with me in public.
And yet you spent time together anyway.
We used to meet at the Botanical Garden.
Nobody much went there.
We'd just walk and talk.
"While you were in Al Khair, the only time you had together were these few stolen moments?"
Mostly.
We spent a night together in a jeep once.
"Well, I'm sure the members get the picture."
"Not like that, sir."
I got an urgent message from Ops.
My mom was having an operation to diagnose a tumour.
It was my mom.
I felt like I was a million miles away.
Fanny held me all night.
"Just held me, till I could call my dad and know my mom was okay."
"Why do you suppose Fanny did that, petty officer?"
Because she loves me.
You're sure about that?
"Yes, I am, sir."
And how do you feel about her?
"I love her with all my heart, sir."
And so you broke these laws so the two of you could be together?
"- Yes, I did, sir."
- And you'd do it all again?
"No, sir."
Romance
"Even if one member of your family is in the audience, it just adds to the nerves."
"For all of our families to be together in this place and be here, it's amazing."
Your turn!
he main reason any of us  lads are here today is because of our families and the way they support us.
You know the...
-...standup boys.
-Cardboard standup.
I want a Louis one.
"And then at night, I can just go and say good night."
And that's my favourite hair on Liam.
I just love that one.
Just shed tears just looking at him.
"-Yeah, you've only got the images."
"-Yeah, that's all you've got."
"They become like someone in a newspaper in a magazine, to you."
always believed that Liam would mak e it but never this big.
Never in my wildest dreams would think he'd be this big.
He goes away for so long.
Sorry.
ith The X Factor Harry went to an audition and never came home again.
"-You weren't ready for that, were you?"
-No.
"As a mother, I should be taking him places and, you know, showing him things."
And it's just kind of turned round and for him to bring us here  it tak es a bit of getting used to.
It feels quite surreal.
please get ready.
"It's no-arm boxing, baby."
You've gotta watch out--
No-arm boxing.
Look at the time.
"Not with just my pants on, anyway."
- No.
I would've gone down for murder.
It was close.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Price."
Good night.
"Hey, Nico."
"Even now, hours after the shooting took place, the entire area surrounding the station has been completely cordoned off."
We have word that the police are actively pursuing the alleged shooter.
"Until an arrest is made, neither his identity nor the identity..."
Did you get a look at the shooter?
Could you just hold me?
Please?
I'm sorry.
I've been crazy with this story.
But it's over now.
It's done.
Is it over for Nico Jackson?
I need you to trust me that nothing happened and that I'm done running around being certifiably insane.
If there's something you don't have... that you're searching for out there...
I want you to find it right here.
There's some music that you need to face.
As in the entire San Francisco Symphony with extra brass and a choir... 112 text messages.
- My God.
- They all want interviews.
Chronicle...
Reader...
KJNA...
Promise me you won't tell anyone where I'm hiding.
You can't hide.
But...
You can run?
"What do you say we... change our names, blow this town, start a new adventure?"
She must've overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
"Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do."
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"All right, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go,"
Any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to track a wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
"Oh, yeah."
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know... to know what?
"Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?"
Because I don't want to be this way anymore.
I hate what I am.
If you heard what dr.
"Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't ready."
I had no choice.
"When they kill the other wraith,"
I won't be able to pretend anymore.
Suits you well.
Shit!
"Ok, you wanna see an alien craft?"
You will see it.
Look.
"You know I always dreamt to fuck a dead man, that's my chance."
You're crazy.
Sure I'm baby.
"That's why you like me, so let's fuck him."
-Don't you touch him.
-You want any?
So you fucked twice today already.
Don't do it!
"You don't like it baby, you don't have to watch."
Crazy!
Don't do it.
"Don't get moral with me, whore, you had to fuck him didn't you?"
I told you not to fuck him.
This is my place I do what I want here.
You can fuck any petty asshole who gives you a chance.
You god damn whore!
Don't you call me that you low-class freaking monster!
Monster!
I'm a monster?
"You let these guys walk on your bones, bitch!"
"and you're gonna kill me with syphylis one day, you dirty cunt."
Don't talk to me like that.
"Your mother was nuts, your father was a bum."
You'll never go anywhere but to the Bowery you belong with the bums.
You shut your mouth or I'll cut you baby.
And nobody will fuck your ugly cunt.
Why did you have to do that to him?
I dare you to say that again!
"I'm sorry, Your Highness."
"Mo Pal-Mo, you better get this straight"
"I know His Majesty favours you,"
"But if you spew nonsense like that again,"
You won't stay alive even if you had ten heads to spare.
Am I clear?
!
See!
Didn't I tell you to cut down on drinking?
And?
I heard His Majesty hasn't given his word yet
My Lady
If we don't send out reinforcements
Will the Hans cut off our salt supply?
What are we going to do?
I'm journeying to Go-San Nation
Go-San Nation?
Might it be for the salt?
Yes.
Although the trade problem with Han Dynasty has been solved...
His Majesty's worry has not abated
I would like to handle this problem for His Majesty.
"I know you have good intentions, but I heard from your grandfather,"
No one really knows if Go-San Nation has any salt.
Please don't worry
I've met some people from Go-San Nation at BuYeo City
I have confidence.
Contact the Yeon Ta-Bal merchant fleet
"If possible, look out for any news from Ju-Mong"
"Yes, My Lady."
"The Governor Of Hyeon-To awaits your wise decision, Your Majesty."
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"Fortunately, not."
"You all remember General Zavros, my ex-associate."
You terminate all your partnerships like this?
On the contrary.
General Zavros did it to himself.
"As you can see, greed, heedless of caution, is a highly combustible mixture."
"I, on the other hand, am a very cautious fellow."
So I waited for you to arrive to show us a way past this... impediment.
Why should we help you?
Because the length of your lives is directly proportionate to how useful you are to me.
"MacGyver, there must be a way we can de-activate this fire."
"Well, I suggest you find it... quickly."
Maybe the answer's in the first line of Solon's riddle.
What do you think?
"""The gods march in r--"
"Rank."""
Yeah.
That one.
"Kelly, you wanna hand me that platinum page?"
It's a key.
Mercury...
Venus...
Earth... the moon...
"Well done, MacGyver."
Now I see why you were Atticus' favorite student.
But what's this red crystal?
Perhaps it's a star.
We're not here to discuss astronomy.
"After you, MacGyver."
Keep moving!
MacGyver.
It's wonderful.
Shut it down.
What happened?
There must have been a surge in the power grid.
"I'll need a few minutes, Captain."
Archer to Enterprise.
Medical emergency.
[Grave instrumental music]
There was nothing I could do.
I'm sorry.
ARCHER:
How's Hoshi coming with that translation?
Their iconography is different from the other Xindi species.
It's taking some time.
"When she's done, ask her to search their database."
See if she can locate anything about their burial rituals.
Do you plan to hold a funeral?
TRIP: [On radio] Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER:
Go ahead.
TRIP:
I think I figured out the problem.
Their power grid can't handle our converters.
It's going to take at least three days to make them compatible.
What about the reactor?
Any way to bring it online?
"It's possible, but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident."
ARCHER:
Stand by.
Work with Trip.
Help him get their reactor up and running.
Sir?
We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship.
He didn't want anybody hearing what he said oranyonelisteningto what he was being told.
and he got a piece of everything they made.
except they were doing it in America.
All they got from Paulie was protection from the guys trying to rip them off.
That's what it's all about.
That's what the FBI could never understand.
What Paulie and the Organization does isprotectpeoplewho can 't go to the cops.
That's it.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.
and they knew I was with somebody.
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morning for fresh bread.
and no matter how many people were waiting
Iwastakencareoffirst .
even though we had no car.
At 13
Iwasmakingmoremoneythanmost of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
I had it all.
One day some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.
You know why?
It was out of respect.
What do you think?
Aren't my shoes great?
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
shut the door.
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
but also feelingmaybeTuddywas right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
I see I must confess.
"When I wrote you that letter, my tender feelings for you so overpowered me"
I could not find words of clarity and persuasion.
I was desperate.
I looked around me for help.
I saw George's book and stole what I needed.
But a year ago this book had not been published.
"Or even written, I suspect."
"I think I've found the truth, for which I thank you, and I owe Madame Sand an apology."
Perhaps now she and I can become friends.
Don't be content with just a little truth.
George will never be content with just your friendship.
She wants your manhood.
"Your virtue, your genius, your soul."
Listen to me!
That woman is a graveyard!
But I can help you.
I can inspire you.
This is the novel and that's the last chapter of the memoir.
- It's a bit on the thin side.
- So's my life.
- Do you know of a good tutor?
- I'll ask around.
"By the way, Mr Chopin came to see me last week."
He asked if you would call on him when you were in town.
Mmm!
Do I hear a duet?
"Perhaps this is not the last chapter, eh?"
"Give me my money, you jackal!"
Madame Aurora Dudevant.
Aurora is the name I was born with.
Aurora.
I thought you were dying.
I thought so too.
The pain was excruciating.
"Julia, do you think if you asked him, Wilcox would give us champagne tonight?"
I hate champagne and Mr Ryder has already had dinner.
Mister Ryder?
Mister Ryder?
Charles drinks champagne at all hours.
"Do you know, looking at this great swaddled foot of mine, I can't get it out of my head that I've got gout, and that gives me a craving for champagne."
- Which way?
- This way.
Dinner was served in the Red Dining Room.
"While they dined, I ate a peach and told them of the war with my father."
"And he said to him ""Living in London, you must miss... your national game."" And Colin said What national game?""... and my father said ""Cricket, of course."""
I really think he's sometimes quite mad.
He sounds a perfect poppet to me.
And now I'm going to leave you boys.
- Where are you off to?
- The nursery.
I promised Nanny a last game of halma.
Dear Nanny Hawkins.
She lives entirely for pleasure.
"Goodnight, Mr Ryder and goodbye."
I'm leaving early.
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for relieving me at the sick bed.
My sister's very pompous tonight.
I don't think she cares for me.
I don't think she cares for anyone very much.
- I love her.
She's so like me.
- Do you?
Is she?
Echizen Ryoma National champion for four years running never lost a single game in the championships.
"- No defeat, that's impressive."
- Ah that's more.
Ryuzaki-sensei.
What kinda guy is that Ryoma?
Playing with the world's top masters with 37 consecutive wins.
"People said that as long as he wasn't injured during the Grand Slam, he wouldn't lose."
Japan's greatest player.
It was also because I looked up to him when I was young that I began playing tennis.
Even now he's still my most respected senpai.
Nitouryu no Samurai Nanjiro.
Exactly.
That boy is Samurai Nanjiro's junior.
"Even if he's famous,"
I still won't give him preferential treatment.
I will treat him fairly.
Now it's just to ensure that we will achieve victory in the Nationals.
Only these.
"As expected, it's here."
We are the same group.
"Ah, o-xhibi."
Come to see the groupings?
About the tournament to decide the regulars...
First years aren't allowed to take part in the ranking matches.
Why would there be your name?
Saa because I am strong.
Don't be so arrogant.
Kaidou.
Give me your guidance.
Tennis is about hitting the ball back fast.
Let's have this practice first.
Don't want to.
What?
Please don't do that stuff!
Don't do that!
"In the year 1701, in a royal hallway of Edo castle,"
"Lord Akou assaulted Kira, a nobleman, with his sword!"
"Lord Akou was made to commit hara-kiri as his vassals scattered as ronin, disguised as merchants and doctors..."
Our story begins one year later in a poor neighborhood in Edo
"By this winter morning, swordfighting has blown out of fashion with the wind"

Morning time...
Wake up!
"Quick, wash your face and get down to the fish market"
"Let me sleep a little longer, Onobu..."
You took the day off yesterday
The sun's already up!
Hurry up!
I'll leave you behind
All this noise every damned morning
Please let me escape this dump
Is master Soza up and about?
What's your business with him?
I'm sure you're up to no good
Do you have to put it like that?
"He needs my advice, that's all"
"Hurry, Pa, or they'll close the fish market"
I'm taking the day off
You took the day off yesterday
What are you still doing in bed?
"Good morning, Osae san"
Already off?
- when he came to the Daily Planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
He was rattled the last time I saw him.
Desperate to give me something...
A locket.
What does a locket have to do with Lionel Luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
"When I was a boy... we took a trip together to Washington, D.C...."
It was just the two of us.
"I thought I was just tagging along on another business trip, but... he wanted to show me the Air and Space museum."
He knew I loved things that could fly.
We were looking up at the Apollo 11 command module.
I couldn't believe it went to the moon.
My father held my hand.
"And he told me, ""The right man, can make anything possible."""
You have his locket.
How did you get him to...
"Lionel was a cruel, sadistic man."
What are you suggesting?
No one will ever know.
I promise you.
Where's the key?
It was empty.
My father must have given it to someone.
I asked you to keep an eye on him.
Lionel stopped by the Daily Planet before going to Luthorcorp.
He was spotted in the basement.
Get the helicopter ready.
Of course.
You killed dad for a necklace?
You're not real.
"I've shown that, haven't I?"
I don't believe I have any ideals.
But you do.
"All that you said to me, the first time we decided to do it about practising what we preach."
I did it to see if we could and then I did it for the pure love of killing.
But you...
I can't help thinking you've done it because of me.
For me.
Yes.
"But I also did it because... because, cos I..."
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.
I wanted to break free of the usual constraints.
"And yes because of you, Richard."
I admired you.
You're not like everyone else.
The rim-ram.
You're unique.
Hi.
"Her name's Carla Burns, lives around the corner."
Looks like she was coming home from work.
"OK, clear."
Anything left in her bag?
There was money still in there.
Doesn't look like a robbery.
"Broad daylight, no attempt to hide the body."
Another victim lying face up.
We've a weapon!
Even as we speak they'll be looking at the body of the woman you killed.
WE killed.
"Our clever friends will be piecing it all together, tying to make sense of it all."
I'm tired of all this Miss Scarlet in the ballroom with the dagger crap.
It's all so crass.
- Nice.
"Good work, Bobbi."
- Of course it is.
"L""m the best."
We were wondering.
Could you be a little more explicit in your report?
"If we""re going to use this in court, we""re going to need more interaction."
You want any extra foam on that?
"- You mean, more touching?"
- Right.
"Just like that, right?"
"Like in the dressing room, could you say... my wife leaned over... and slid her hand between Lisa""s thighs?"
"You mean, like this?"
"Yeah, that""s good."
And maybe something like this?
"Mr. Caine, you do understand that men and women are different."
That women sometimes like to kiss and hug and carry on... and they have absolutely no intention of having sex.
Right.
"I take the cheating business very seriously, Mr. Caine."
"And it doesn""t take a private investigator that""s first class, like me... to know that y""all have an agenda."
"So whatever that is, you need to take it someplace else."
"Now, hold on."
"Blue Moon doesn""t play your dirty little games."
"If someone""s cheating in that marriage, it ain""t Pam Caine."
"L""m keeping the pictures."
"No, I will not be flexible on the issue."
"I gave up the house, he gave up the kids."
"What do you mean, legally?"
"Legally, I""m their mother."
"I got to go, okay?"
"L""ll call you back."
Hi.
"So, uh, when can we get started?"
"When Amanda goes back, I'll have time."
Okay.
Well... good-bye.
Bye.
Ready?
"Kyle, I can't go out."
But you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry.
I can't see you.
Amanda?
Inside!
This is all your fault.
What?
My daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
You're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
Drop out of the conservatory?
Why?
As if you didn't know you're the reason.
She didn't say anything to me about it.
We haven't even had a chance to talk.
You're not gonna get that chance.
"You will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school."
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
"Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction."
"I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay."
"Well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes."
"What I mean is, try to see things from her perspective."
"That music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss."
I don't want her to miss it.
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
"They both put 100 quid in every month, regularly, no withdrawals."
"Yet last Tuesday at 11:00am, one of the comes into the building society and cleans the whole lot out."
We checked her hours with her boss.
"Last Tuesday, Kelly was at work all day."
She didn't even take a lunch break.
Then it must have been Mr Hartson the loving fiance.
Why clean out the account before they even got married?
They had a row Thursday lunchtime.
You got any idea why Tom wanted to clear out their savings account?
Is that what he did?
Did they row a lot?
A bit.
Lately.
Just put it down to pre-wedding nerves.
You thought there was more to it?
"A week ago, Kelly got home to find the bedding had been changed."
"Sheet, duvet, the lot."
Tom reckoned he'd spilled something over it.
"So Kelly thought he'd had company, yeah?"
Tom had never changed the sheets in his life.
I suggested she bring the sheet in.
For a test?
Yeah.
"She did bring the sheet in the day after, but... as far as I know, she chickened out."
I don't think she wanted to know the truth.
Where is the sheet now?
Did she take it back?
No idea.
It was in her locker.
You got it?
Yeah.
They look like the perfect couple.
Would you stop?
!
Why did you come looking for me?
Sarah...
I was fine.
I came because I wanted to understand why this happened.
"This happened because you and mom, you won't let me live my life."
"You think you can make decisions for me for the rest of my life, forever."
"No, Sarah, that's not true."
I want you to decide.
Right.
Decide to go to art school?
Yes.
"Yeah, so even there, you're taking the thing that I love, and you're..."
"You know I'm an adult, right?"
"And so, that means, for the first time, finally, finally, I can make my own decisions."
You can't control me.
I can do what I want!
"And right now, what I want is to get the hell out of here!"
Tom.
"Just, uh..."
just give me a minute.
Thank you... for taking me back there.
I know it was hard.
"Yeah, you know, I always assumed that it was the problems between marjorie and I that were to blame for what happened with Sarah."
And now?
"Well, now I know it was more complicated than that."
We were scared.
"We thought she was just messing around, you know?"
We thought she just didn't wanna grow up.
"When, in fact, that's exactly what she was trying to do."
"She accused you of wanting to make decisions for her, forever."
I won't let them do it to me.
They won't get anything.
That's how the business is done.
- What is he saying?
- He may say lots of things.
Igor...
Don't do anything to me please.
I would have given you the 500 thousand from the last contract myself if you had called me.
There was nothing between your wife and me.
"I just danced with her, and that's all."
Everything else is a lie!
Did you find any papers with my signature?
"No, we found nothing so far."
May be you should turn to the police officials?
It was a real attack.
So crazy!
I got confused.
Where are the real people?
Where are the images I created?
I'm scared.
May be I shall forget about it all and start painting again.
"I showed promise, didn't I?"
"Garik, you're my best friend."
I need your help.
The situation is difficult but not hopeless.
But if you drink so much you'll get delirium tremens instead of schizophrenia.
You're joking and I don't want to live.
I'm dreaming that I'm King Solomon.
May be you are Tsar Solomon.
May be all your troubles are just a dream.
Solomon was not a bad guy.
I wouldn't brush him aside if I were you.
"When I first had Geneva, it was like..."
"I recognized her, you know?"
"I mean, she had Dave's smile, and she had my eyes, and..."
What is it?
I can't say anything right with Dave these days.
I thought things were better.
We haven't slept in the same bed in months.
"And ever since the wedding, it's--"
"He's been acting even more distant, you know."
It's like...
I don't understand.
"Something just changed that day, and I can't tell if I'm pushing him away or he's pulling away, or I..."
I don't know.
It's just all...
"You still love him, right?"
"Well... if I didn't, would I be crying at this stupid chick song?"
"Look, your marriage is worth saving, so you gotta stop talking and start doing."
"- Doing what, though?"
- Being there for him.
Being involved in what he likes and what he's doing.
"If it's work that's absorbing his time, get into it."
"If it's something he cares about, you gotta care about it, too."
- I do.
I do.
- Don't tell me.
Show him.
"I really like you, Suzanne."
I want to work things out with Deena.
Nobody's stopping you.
I shouldn't even be here.
"You have a lot going on with your marriage, the launch..."
So why not just be in the moment?
"Instead of being caught here and get turned into fur coats, let's go back into the mountain, dad."
How could you say such a thing?
A spell has given us a temporary human form.
"But if we fail that day, we live as a fox forever."
Do you know that?
The pain of having to eat raw meat.
The pain of having to take a dump without toilet paper.
"Ouch, it's rough!"
Oh my God!
"Since we have only one life to live,"
I want to live on two human feet even if it's a short life.
- It's all your fault!
- Wait.
"All they need to do is stay alive until that day, right?"
How will you keep them alive?
We can't afford to pay the medical bills.
And the circus is doing bad.
How can we keep them alive?
Let me go.
"Hey, let him go."
"Okay, tell me."
Do you have any ideas?
Make money.
Make money?
There is nothing we can't do with money.
You mean cold-hard cash?
She's our new girl.
The tail dance is her specialty.
"Hello, I'm Miss Fox."
# We need money to live in this world
# You can't live without money # in the human world
# People want to make money
"I believe it, you know."
"In fact, this brother I visited, Celestino, he was a real hijo de una puta."
I remember the day that I finally accepted it.
But I hated him for so much of my life.
"It was like a dam broke inside of me, releasing a torrent of hatred."
Was that the same dam that released the torrent of bullshit that's comin' out of your mouth right now?
"Do me a favor, tough guy, okay?"
Don't tell me this is about some epic clash between two brothers.
This is about you and your needs.
"Cut to the chase, Gecko, or this will become a feeding ground."
I used to think that she was just a dancing girl.
"But now, now I get it."
She's your queen.
That's why I'm gonna bring her back to you.
Your headliner.
I'm gonna bring you back Santanico Pandemonium.
"Kate, help me move this rack."
Come on!
"Come on, let's go!"
We gotta get out of here!
- [Carlos] Gonzalez!
- Ready?
"One, two, three."
[grunting]
I am trying to be civil here!
- [pounding]
"- You know, maybe..."
- Maybe he's not wrong.
- About what?
About the blood well not being such a bad idea.
It could keep the culebras from killing.
"You don't seriously believe anything he says, do you?"
Do you have kids too?
Is your husband unemployed?
Did he mess up while doing business and ask you to bring home money?
What crazy person do you think would marry a beggar like me?
"If it were, would you do that?"
I don't have a husband and most definitely do not have kids.
"I don't have a house, money, or pride, so I'm living with my friend Na Ri."
So what?
"Because of a certain psycho, I got fired from my job, and I will continue to not have money, a house, or a husband."
Is it entertaining?
Is it funny?
Why do I even bother saying these kinds of things to you?
Crazy wench...
-SKYYoonproductionPD.
-Hello?
"-It's me, Yoon PD."
I think you will have to continue working on Sin Joon Young's documentary.
I thought you were switching me out for a different PD.
Sin Joon Young said that he would not film a single scene if you weren't the PD.
He said to cut back on all of the staff except for the production crew.
I think you'll have to come to the company to discuss it.
"You can come now, right?"
Hello?
No PD!
"No PD, are you listening?"
Hello?
"Ah, I'm telling you, it's urgent!"
♬  Hey boy!
♬
♬ Show me your love ♬
♬ You and I ♬
♬  Good morning.
"I don't like your manner, I don't like your style, I don't like your attitude."
But I do like your ideas.
"Stephens, I'm putting next year's entire campaign in your hands."
- You are?
- Yes.
We've been advertising the same way for 30 years.
It's not working anymore.
That's why I changed agencies decided we have to keep things up-to-date.
Get to work on that campaign right away.
"And remember one thing, gentlemen Waterhouse is my name and thumbtacks is my game."
He wants me.
"Darrin, you must have somebody watching over you."
"Larry, I just learned something."
"- When a man can't lose, he can't win."
- Where are you going?
"- To a bar, to drown my sorrows."
- Drown your sorrows?
You just landed a big account.
"Well, let's just say I'm a sore winner."
"Yeah, you came to the right guy for advice, Darrin."
I'm an expert.
I know everything about marriage.
That's why I'm still single.
I don't get it.
I'm married to a girl who can have anything in the whole world yet she chose me.
- Take my brother.
He's had four years of happy marriage.
"The trouble is, he's been married for 16."
She must love me.
Gave up everything for me.
But obviously she misses all those luxuries.
Who can blame her?
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.
"Sort of looked up to me, you know."
We did our first work together.
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.
During Prohibition we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune.
"Your father, too."
"As much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him."
Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for G. I.s going to the West Coast.
That kid's name was Moe Greene and the city he invented was Las Vegas.
This was a great man.
A man of vision and guts.
"And there isn't even a plaque, signpost or statue of him in that town."
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
No one knows who gave the order.
"When I heard it, I wasn't angry."
"I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong."
"Talking loud, saying stupid things."
"So when he turned up dead, I let it go."
"And I said to myself,"
"""This is the business we've chosen. """
"I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business."
That two million in a bag in your room...
I'm going in to take a nap.
"When I wake, if the money is on the table, I know I have a partner."
"If it isn't, I know I don't."
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.
"Good to see you, Mike."
I'm glad we spend this time together.
# Now stand by with your glasses All ready
# Drink a health to the men Of the skies... #
"Here's to the memory of a fine, brave man."
I remember the smile on his face as he went.
"What you trying to do, turn this into a wake?"
"If you two girls go and sit over there, I'll get your drinks."
"""Easy as falling off a log"" he said."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
Because he was a right guy.
He'd tell you to drink that beer instead of crying into it.
Let's have a game of darts.
You two go ahead.
I'm all right.
"I don't care for darts, maybe it'll make him more cheerful."
May I sit down?
It's a free country.
"Wow, that's a rousing welcome."
What did you expect a 21-gun salute?
"Make it 48, will you?"
I heard about this morning.
About Breton.
Let's talk about something else.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were like the others.
Scared inside and covering up.
"But you're not scared, are you?"
Sure I am.
No you're not.
You know what they say around here?
There are two types of men who jump.
Those who are crazy and those who are scared.
- I'm apologizing!
Has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
"Stan, listen to me."
It was my fault too.
"I tripped over the cable, I."
This is not about you.
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people."
Let's get that stage reset and make it look good.
"Big, big jackpot on monday."
- Garfunkel?
"- Yeah, I'm probably the biggest garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
That's not the...
point exactly.
Natalie's a human being.
"Now all this attention can throw a person off-balance, especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly."
"I once wrote a book on body language, and it... it spent all of three minutes on the best seller list."
"Now I was very young, and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
- I didn't like myself very much.
- So now you're on her side.
The question is why aren't you on her side?
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie's your friend.
Maybe you're afraid...
She doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
Totally green.
Zero carbon footprint after manufacture.
It looks like a handbag.
Bet it really pulls the birds.
I'm going out.
You stay here and do absolutely nothing.
(Mobile rings)
- Just a minute.
Hello.
Millington Tech Support.
"- Make yourself comfortable, my boy."
"- Oh, yes!"
There we are.
Ho-ho!
"It's driving like a dream, Mr Matthews."
"Like most people of genius, Mary had a grand theory."
So...
Thank you.
"Mary spent 20 years trying to model plankton population, so that we could work towards re-seeding the deserted areas of the ocean."
You're talking about fish food.
"Plankton can also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Mr Kingdom."
Re-seed even a fraction of the Pacific and you could stop global warming in its tracks.
- Reverse it.
- Gosh!
Gosh!
That is why Barkway wants to get his hooks into it.
"But, Miss Cramer..."
"Oh, please call me Janet, since you are buying me cakes and everything."
"Janet, all Professor Barkway intends is to publish Mary's research."
Isn't that exactly what she would have wanted?
Don't you think I'm a better judge of that than anyone else?
"So, you're going to publish it yourself?"
Aren't you ashamed?
People will keep chasing us if we run.
They will stop only if we make them run instead.
"Tomorrow, by this time, we have the money in hand."
Nothing should stop that.
Understood?
You are the reason for all these!
We can't get any money from Varun.
All his money has been spent on his eye surgery.
Everything has messed up.
we have to leave empty-handed now!
Forget it.
We can't expect all our attempts to be successful.
One or two might go out of our hands.
Okay.
What's next?
I'll tell you.
And listen...
Give us our share.
"What are you saying, uncle?"
We won't get any money.
And you are talking about a share!
Look...
"From spying on Varun and drafting a plan for you, there has been no mistake from our side."
If the plan messes up in the last minute...
We can't help that.
- Hey...
You will get your share if the plan go as anticipated.
Or else...
The loss is for everyone.
"If you'd properly given our share earlier, why would I demand now?"
You always take the major share.
You're in excruciating pain.
"God, all for a few inches."
Pain and agony for a little bit of pleasure.
I get it.
"If it's that bad, why don't you just stop sleep--"
- Doing what you're doing?
- Because it doesn't feel bad when I'm...
Doing it.
It's good.
It's great.
"And maybe if you weren't so scared of getting burned, you'd feel the same."
"You know, I used to walk tall around here."
I used to walk tall.
Then...
Came George.
He took off at least an inch.
Then Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.
I got shorter.
"All that humiliation, it makes you shorter."
"So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt because one more personal disaster right now would cut me off at the knees."
"So, uh, Valentine's day?"
"Personally, I mean, I think you can't go wrong with jewelry."
"- If you want, I can recommend some local plac--"
- What is wrong with you?
What?
We just took a liver and an intestine from a little kid.
A dead little kid.
And you don't even care.
You're talking about rainbows and relationships and crap.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You don't think that I know that they just pulled the plug on a kid?
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your god."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
We can expose U.S. Forces secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp?
A good night's sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.
"Remarkable technology, is it not?"
Not you.
My b0315-
I made the first few for revenge but then
I started exploring new aspects of myself.
Can I have a sip?
Mmm.
"I have lived these past years, Henry."
"My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid."
You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.
Hit play.
Over there.
Go on.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
I've got you Under my skin
I've got you deep In the heart of me
So deep in my heart That you're really A part of me
I've got you Under my skin
I 'd tried so Not to give in
"I said to myself ""This affair never Will go so well"""
"But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well"
I've got you under my skin?
(WARNING ALARM BEEPS)
What is all this?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
"Something's wrong with you, mate."
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gonna sit you down in this ohair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
(LOCK CLICKS)
"- Yeah, I'd really love to believe you."
"I really would, because I don't even have to go to work this morning."
I would love to believe in a universe... where you wake up and you don't have to go to work... and you step outside and meet two beautiful 18 year-old sisters... who are also girlfriends... and... are also very nice people.
You guys seem like very nice people.
We are nice.
"What would you do... if you believed wewere 18, which we are?"
"Well, I can't even tell ya."
- I can't tell you till you're 18.
- That's not true.
What about freedom of speech and the Constitution?
- What are you talkin' about?
- Free speech.
Okay.
"Well, I don't know what you're talking about... but I can't talk dirty to you... because then I'd be a pervert... and probably even a pedophile too, so-"
- No one has ever talked dirty to us.
- Really?
Sounds very appealing.
I'm gonna go inside now.
Okay.
We'll wave to you.
- Make sure to look.
- I will.
"- Oh, he's probably jerking off."
"- Oh, my God!"
He is.
You can so tell he is.
- How?
- I can feel it.
See that crack?
That's where his hard-on is.
Let's kiss.
Okay.
How maybe I could have stopped it all
"If I had been braver and said something,"
"Well, that's when all this started."
"I'm sorry, daddy."
I should have said something to you.
Sir.
I've...
I'm so sorry.
"I had a dream last night,"
And in it... :
I saw ev-everything.
Now I know why you did what you did.
"I'm so sorry if I was short with you yesterday,"
So sorry about what happened to arianna...
To you and lily.
For everything.
Thank you.
It's been quite a burden.
The hardest part has been keeping my wife in the dark.
"Unfortunately, it looks like that's..."
No longer an option.
You are gonna come forward?
I don't think I really have a choice.
I should have put it all together sooner.
The obituaries that he was leaving everywhere...
That's how he figured it all out--
He must have come across one in prison
"And when he saw her picture, imagine his surprise"
When he realized that he raped
The daughter of his own defense attorney.
I'm gonna call a press conference
"Tomorrow, late afternoon,"
"If I wasn't, I should have kept my mouth shut."
Name's Jonas.
Allan.
Allan Campbell.
"What you said about being a human punching bag, you definitely look the part."
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Corporate world's a bitch.
How'd you know that?
There'll be no salvation
Is the hatred one a bad person?
A very evil person
Cruel one?
Very much
He is so cruel
Did this person get faith (Islam) afterwards?
I want him to turn into pieces every each day
He shall die slowly
He should suffer from intense pain

Welcome Signora Isabella
You are my guest here
Don't worry.
Nobody can do harm to you
You are under my protection.
You'll be treated in the best way here
Yakup Efendi what do you think?
Is there any poison that would kill slowly and with pain?
"My Sultana, it is difficult"
Fly low.
Understood.
Transform.
Clear the museum of civilians.
Please evacuate in an orderly passion.
These humans did not respond.
"Well, I don't think we should worry too much about them, partner."
We need to move the planters to create a fire block.
But I...
That would destroy the harmonious nature of the plaza's design.
What?
"Nice of you to show up, Dani!"
Could've been here sooner if my ride wasn't stuck in neutral.
Next time I'm walking.
Looks like a short started the fire.
But this should hold for a while.
Cyber wires are too much for these old circuits.
I have to insist the good thing nobody got hurt.
- I didn't tell it to do that.
- I wouldn't complain.
Your robot was still in rescue mode.
"You gave him the directives to save lives, so it did."
"You're welcome, Graham."
- Where are you going?
- I need some space.
Chief said there is a bunker below street level.
Really I get something called...
the cold war.
"Apparently, we're getting some space too."
Wait for me!
I still don't get it.
How did Cade's robot know that...
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.
"""No voice divine the storm allayed."
"No light propitious shone."""
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Mamma...
Look.
This has just arrived.
"""I should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon..."""
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No.
I will fetch her.
"Wait, let us delay."
I believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.
It would be cruel to take her away so soon.
Devonshire is so far.
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable?
But...?
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate.
His reading...
Elinor has not your feelings.
Can he love her?
Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet.
- Leon?
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
- Leon?
But he made up the name.
I don't know what it was before.
Some people called him Moussa and that annoyed him.
You met him on the set?
"No, I met him at a little Algerian restaurant."
Maurice studied at the Sorbonne and at night he made couscous.
"Strange guy, anarchist, atheist, and an excellent cook."
We became friends and one day he told me his story.
I don't know how we suddenly found ourselves working on a script.
A sad love story.
"Like Romeo and Juliet, but in Algeria."
Why didn't you finish the movie?
It was a mistake to begin with.
It was my idea that he direct it.
"I financed it, I recruited all our friends from the Sorbonne."
You realize I was a little in love with him.
I was young and he had a poetic soul.
I thought if we made the film he'd love me as he loved your mother.
That's the story.
We barely managed to film two scenes-.
"Maurice became depressed, he didn't show up and everything stopped."
Want to see?
- See the film?
"- No, there's nothing left of it."
But I have a few photos.
Come.
This is all that remains.
"Pictures, moments."
If I'd known that 40 years later
"Okay, um, not that I care about this challenge, but it's cheating to wear overalls over a suit."
"No, it's not."
"They're not called ""over-T-shirts,"" Robin."
"They're not called "" over shirtless fat guys who used to come fix my mom's car"
"""and then hang out with her upstairs for a little while."""
No.
"They're called overalls, okay?"
And I can wear them over whatever I want.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Hey.
"Oh, he's not saying hello, he's just telling you what he feeds his horsies."
(ROBIN GIGGLES)
"Oh, man, I can sit here and make you-Iook-like-a-farmer jokes all night."
(CHUCKLES) Challenge accepted.
Good evening.
"Tonight, we're gonna have a nice, quick class on bridges."
There are six types of bridges.
"Beam, cantilever, arch, suspension, and two others."
"You got land on both sides, water in the middle."
See you all next week.
"Hey, we get you for the whole hour."
"Oh, come on."
"I mean, who really wants to sit here and listen to me yap about bridges for an hour?"
Really?
(LILY EX CLAIMS)
I just thought about how awesome Ted is again.
(LILY AND TED LAUGHING)
This is a weird drinking game.
Can I buy you a drink?
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) He's got a big brown jug with three X's on it.
What have I done?
One very important thing to keep in mind when designing a bridge...
"Look, you can't keep running away."
"Come on, Janet, be reasonable."
We have a duty to resolve this.
- It's for the good of the college.
- We both know it's nothing of the sort!
You'll get nothing from me.
Scott?
Coffee!
"Black, two sugars."
- Try rebooting the whole system.
(Another phone rings)
- Luke Skywalker mug.
"- OK, I'll call you back."
And a custard cream.
(Rock music)
"Scott, will you keep the noise down!"
(Music off)
- Get your own coffee.
I'm not your slave.
(Gentle chimes)
- Sherry?
- Thank you.
Dinner tonight at High Table and tomorrow we start the conference bright and early at ten.
The college has suffered something of a minor tragedy.
"Three weeks ago, Dr Mary Goodyear, head of our biology department, died while on a marine expedition in the South Pacific."
"Yes, I read about it."
"Dr Goodyear's research was of the very first order, you understand."
"But when I came to examine her papers after her death, it soon became clear that sections of the research were missing."
Goodness!
"What, you mean stolen?"
"No, no, no, no, nothing like that."
"It's this bloody librarian, Janet Cramer."
It's not too easy for me either.
"You're probably wondering, who's this funny guy in cowboy boots that's taking you on a vacation."
You're not sure what... is happening.
I want us to be friends.
I know your mother's divorced.
You're not sure what happened.
I'm very fond of your mother.
I want her to be happy.
I want you to be happy.
I'd like to be happy.
"See, I know your father's real smart and he's a professor and, uh, that's real good."
I'm not trying to replace your father.
"But, uh, you know, I'm pretty smart too."
I sell property around here.
I sell desert land to Arabs.
That's pretty hard.
I'm trying to make this all work out between us.
"If you give me a chance, maybe it will."
"Well, what do you say?"
"Yeah, well, you should think it over, okay?"
"Okay, now, let me warn you, he's going to try to get away with murder."
I've seen him reduce really experienced babysitters to mush in one night.
I've got a little brother like that.
[mother] you do?
How do you handle him?
Either I ignore him or I sock him.
"- [laughs] - [""'The Sunset Trail""' playing on TV]"
"Hey, look, he likes ice cream, so later on, if the two of you want some, here's some money."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"- Hey, are you decent?"
- [men singing on TV]
Joyland!
Joyland!
Happy-girl-and-boy land
Laughing and playing From year to year
Trouble and care Never enter here
Singing!
Dancing!
Under sunny skies
Happy forever and ever
In childhood paradise!
[PLAYING REVEILLE]
- Count off.
USHERS:
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
At ease.
"Now, men, Mr. Jeffries has something important to say to you."
"Boys, I've been managing picture theaters for a long time."
This is the neatest and best-drilled company of ushers I've ever seen.
But some are not measuring up to the necessary standards of discipline that I insist upon.
I won't mention any names.
This is merely a friendly warning that any usher caught chewing gum during the performance of duty will be dismissed.
I also have a report that a certain usher is making a habit of using the men's lavatory on the mezzanine floor for dice and crap games.
This must stop.
I think I've made myself clear.
Where?
At your company.
Isn't she a sales assistant?
So you think one of my staff members has become a porn model?
Never.
She's not my kind.
Are you going home?
Yeah.
Are you scared of your wife?
All wives are scary.
So are you going to put some mud on your golf clubs?
Oh!
You've become an expert.
Have you done this with anyone else before?
So what did you want to talk to me about?
Someone left this on my desk.
"The model is you, isn't it?"
Luckily he left it on my desk.
But what if someone left it on a managers' desk instead?
A friend of mine tricked me into this.
I don't care who tricked you.
"What I'm asking you is, what should I do?"
What should you do?
Should I show it to the manager or keep it secret?
Are you threatening me?
"No, I don't mean it like that."
I thought perhaps it would be better if I started seeing you at your home instead.
Is this a threat?
It's been quite costly.
What with the money I've been giving to you as well.
Isn't that natural because we love each other?
Why don't you show it to the manager or whoever you want?
I don't want to go home alone.
"All right, Johan, grab your passport."
The party's moving.
"All right, all right, I got our drinks."
And look what else I got.
"Michelle, here, works for Ticketron, and penny is currently suing a major airline."
"You guys should have plenty to talk about, because Neal here has bought tickets for an airplane."
What are you doing?
"I am sending you to ""pound town."""
I don't want to go there.
"Ladies, excuse us."
"Before you say anything,"
I'm comfortable with any combination.
"Look, Mark, I'm not in the mood to hook up with a random stranger."
They're not random.
I hand-picked them.
"Look, when you go through a break up, your body stops producing dopamine, and serotonin."
You know what it does not stop producing?
Sperm.
"Let the pain, and the sperm, out."
"Look, there is no pain, okay?"
"I mean, there should be, but there isn't."
I should be devastated.
"But, I'm not, I'm..."
I'm mostly just relieved.
And it's nothing.
That's not nothing.
Nothing is something.
Feeling nothing is what... it's what being a guy is all about.
Go with that.
Okay.
I feel a little ashamed that I feel relieved.
- So are we all right?
"- Yeah, we´re fine."
All right.
Let´s do this.
I got the high res on monitor two.
Tony.
Didn´t know I was gonna see you today.
You know what we want.
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
I already told Jack everything I know.
I want you to tell me.
"First Jack, now you."
What does that remind me of?
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?
"So, where do we look for Alvers?"
It´s a nice ring.
Who´s the lucky girl?
Hope you did a background check cos you don´t wanna make the same mistake twice.
You´re going back to prison.
There´s a good chance you´ll be executed as a traitor.
"You know if you cooperate you may be able to save your own life, but you´re stalling."
"Which means you know something and think there´s a play you can make, only now´s not the right time."
Very incisive.
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
Why don´t you tell me about Alvers?
All I know is that he works only with Amador.
I don´t know him personally.
All we´ve been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
He had an mri on one of his knees.
There´s a prescription for antibiotics.
Treated for hiv.
(rapid bleeping)
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
M r.
"Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- H im hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
Yeah?
Ah!
"Thank you, darling."
You're welcome.
Keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming.
Gail's going to get so mad at you for getting her boy drunk.
I've got Gail wrapped around my little finger.
Yeah.
"Says the guy who taught me to fly his crop duster when I was 13, then told Mom I was lying when I mentioned it."
I was so jealous.
"My mom knew that you let him fly, and she wouldn't let me go anywhere near you."
"You see, Jake would..."
Jake would come over and tell me all the stories you told him.
I loved...
I loved the one about the peanuts.
What the hell are you talking about?
The peanuts in World War II.
"He means the ""Nuts"" story, Grandpa."
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.
So what's the story?
"Tell me the story, somebody."
What?
It's his story.
All right.
World War II.
The winter of 1944.
"The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines, and surrounded a division of Americans in a little town called Bastogne,"
"freezing and starving and running out of ammunition, but they knew that they had to hold that ground."
"Just before Christmas, the Nazis sent a note to the American commander telling him that he could surrender and save the rest of his men, or they could stay and fight."
"The American commander sent a one-word reply to the Wehrmacht commander,"
Carrasco's back.
- How many people died?
- Have something to drink.
Thank you.
"Welcome, Carrasco."
Enrique!
"They don't know, do they?"
"In Puerto and Timulcha, they called us criminals."
People here should know about that as well.
Padre Julio has kept the truth from them.
"They dropped leaflets from planes, but he said that it was nothing but bad propaganda, that Carrasco was supposed to surrender, that the Leopard was beaten."
Leave them alone for a while.
These men need to rest.
Go back to your work.
I'll go and get him immediately.
"- General, the president is on line 1."
- All right.
Thank you.
- This is General Benítez.
- We need to airlift fuel to the north.
- That's impossible.
- Why?
"During the blockade of Berlin, thousands of planes were employed."
"Of course, Señor Presidente, but we don't have any planes."
Don't argue with me.
Carry out my orders as soon as you can.
- Very well.
I'll do everything possible.
- You better had.
"Excuse me, these are the new defence plans for the refineries."
Thank you.
...plan 3 is to be carried out immediately.
Come on.
THE END
Doomed.
"Doomed to a violent end, that Clara Nash was."
"I'm telling you, Sergeant."
Doomed to a violent end.
"I know, Mrs. Slocum, you told me."
"Three times, already."
"And I'm trying to find out, with your help, who murdered her."
The horror of it all.
[sighs]
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
And that poor little boy.
Whatever is gonna become of him.
"Mom, please, mom."
Try to control yourself.
And to think that I was practically the last one to see her alive.
Me.
"Mrs. Slocum, if you could just give me a few minutes of your valuable time, l--"
My valuable time.
"Well, thank you very much, Sergeant."
"You hear that, Janie?"
The Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
Just goes to show how a person's whole life can be changed... just by somebody getting murdered.
"First, there was the flowers from the women's club... with a very kind note of sympathy."
Plus an invitation... to tell about my experiences on the fatal night.
And now the Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
"Well, let's face it, Janie."
"How much was my valuable time worth, yesterday?"
"85 cents an hour, plus carfare."
"I was just a plain, simple baby-sitter."
She found another way to get through the night.
A little chemical enhancement.
There are hundreds of Christian camps that minister to thousands of youth every summer.
"Some of these youth have already accepted the truth, but some need direction in their lives."
"By attending camp, we could give 'em that help, by reintroducing them to the blessings of the lord."
Tonight Michelle decided she was gonna share with her brothers and sisters by spiking dinner with several milligrams of ecstasy.
"Dear lord, thank you so much for this food."
- Amen.
- All:
Amen.
Amen.
I feel amazing.
I love you guys.
"We love you, too."
[Laughter]
It didn't take long for these happy campers to go from holy rollers...
[Heavy breathing and sighing]
To horn dogs.
[Laughing] Yeah!
[Laughter]
Michelle sat back to enjoy the show.
Rock star!
Rock star!
Rock star!
[Coughs]
But she suddenly got a little choked up.
[Coughs]
[Laughing] I'm sorry.
"After inhaling the soot from the fire,"
Michelle grabbed a thermos to clear her throat.
[Coughs]
It didn't go down too well.
"Peter Rickman, age 41."
Accident.
"Brought in late afternoon just after you left for the day, Dr. Stegman."
- The patient is presenting...
- I know what he's presenting with.
"I read the papers, Dr. Hook."
How's his nut?
"His ""nut,"" as you say, is banged up."
How severely has yet to be ascertained.
Why don't you run some tests?
I may have to operate later.
Anyone else?
"Sally Druse, age 65, mildly hypertensive... presenting with numbness of the right arm, possible paresis, paraesthesia, or neuralgia."
I've ordered an MRI.
I beg your pardon?
"""M"" as in ""Map,"" ""R"" as in ""Rat,"" ""l"" as in ""Idiot."""
Only one person in this department has the right to order an MRI.
And that person is me.
"- Cancel it immediately, please."
- I can't.
What did you say?
It's already happened.
If you'd been in for early rounds...
"I have disliked your attitude for the last six weeks, since I've been here, Dr. Hook."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Dr. Stegman."
You're insubordinate and arrogant.
I'll have your job for this.
"I think that went well, don't you?"
Aren't you worried?
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already.
"What are you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
"""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
And he would be a lawyer and I would have his children.
And in the week ends we would barbecue.
And all the other princes and their princesses would come:
"and they would say delicious, delicious,"
"Or, how boring!"
"So I was taught, that I should come to New-York and become an independant model."
And my prince would come and he would be... an agent.
And he would get me a role.
And I would make my living waiting on tables.
I would wait till thirty...
till forty...till fifty.
And I was taught that to be an actress one should be fashionable.
And to befashionable is to be androgenous.
And I'm androgenous not less that David Bowie himself.
They call me beautiful.
And I kill with my cunt.
Isn't it fashionable?
Come on who's next?
I take lessons.
How to get into show business.
"Be nice to your professor,"
be nice to your agent.
Be nice to your audience.
Be nice.
How to be a woman?
Want them when they want you.
How to be free and equal.
Fuck women instead of men and you'll discover a whole kingdom of freedom.
Men won't step on you anymore.
Women will.
"So come on, who's next?"
Who wants to teach me?
Then one day...
Congratulations on your graduation.
It's beautiful.
"Thank you, Kojima-kun."
I even managed to get a kiss.
"Next is, at last, Valentine's day."
Lately we're not selling well.
"Dad, I'm going to be using the kitchen."
- That's the working place of a pro!
"If you're doing things for your hobby, go do it in the kitchen at home."
"Since we don't have any customers, it should be fine, right?"
"Ah, Souta-kun."
Are you making chocolate again?
Should I help?
"- Thanks, Kaoruko-san."
"But I'm making this for my girlfriend,"
I have to do it on my own.
"- Well, I guess."
An adult man making chocolate for a woman.
"After asking to go to a confectionary school, then making things that won't even be for sale, it's hard to bear as a parent."
Then we should put them up for sale.
- Eh?
Souta-kun's chocolates.
"The prototypes from the other day were high quality, with a delicate impression."
I think it's on a higher level than the chocolatiers around here.
Really?
Thanks.
That's thanks to my DNA.
DNA?
"DNA, he says."
Alright.
"But, well, there really aren't many guys who make chocolates for their girlfriends."
Commissioner ... has failed to ensure peace cows.
"It is necessary to provide the size, I   ever."
Marie is his most valuable.
She burns the sharks than in other times have rejoiced to roast his wife.
"A hero, Commissioner, suffering ..."
Fixing glue!
Do warm nuts!
The horses are waiting for me at the gate.
"Accompagnatemi not, I will go alone."
Give me a drink.
- Now where you go?
- In town.
- This is Nina Nicolaevna?
- Yes
"Last Thursday, my uncle was not good and we have telegraphed to come."
Why you say that you kissed the land on which he walked?
You should kill me instead.
"Rest, I must rest!"
I am a seagull!
I said to you:
"lies, pain ..."
Do not you want more.
I am an actress!
I am an actress!
"He did not believe the theater, we always joke with my dreams, and I have come to an end to believe it too."
I have lost the courage!
"The torments of love, jealousy ..."
The continuing fear for my child.
"They become petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know what to do with my hands, no longer controlling my voice."
You do not know this.
Sentire to recite so abominable.
all night.
I couldn't care less.
"Lieutenant, I've been trying to figure out how much time Zucco had to plant this bomb."
Do you know what time he got here?
He got here about 8:00.
What time did he leave the store?
He was still there at 5:30 before Mr. Morgan left.
"That only gives him about, uh, two and a half hours."
That means this nut could've planted it anyplace...
"NewJersey, Riverdale, Staten Island!"
All right.
Here.
This is a list of addresses of these patients here.
I want you to call Explosives.
"Check out all their houses, okay?"
"Who knows, maybe one of these people got under Zucco's skin."
"Hey, it's possible, you know."
We're not dealing with what you call a rational person.
"There really is no need to check us out, Lieutenant."
He couldn't do it.
He loved us.
"We're a family, right?"
"Now, look."
I don't want to disturb your group.
"But maybe tonight, somebody's gonna get blown up who's got a nice family going for him."
"Now, did this Zucco complain about anybody or you complain to him, where he might have set off with another bomb?"
"Well, the only thing I talked to him about lately was baseball."
"I got him interested in the Mets, became their fan."
Strange.
He was never a fan before.
"How about you, Mrs. Holder?"
Anything mentioned about that divorce?
And why so?
"You see, Miss Sheetal, there are many reasons for this."
"It so happened that... ltjust crossed my mind that, I thought you'd understand what I understood."
But you couldn't understand it either.
And you thought I understood what you were tying to make me understand.
This misunderstanding has created a bit of confusion.
"And ifyou see through, we are stuck in a strange whirlwind."
Whirlwind!
What whirlwind?
I don't get what you say.
Exactly.
This is the confusion.
And to get out of it we must meet rightaway.
"And ifwe put our heads together, Miss Sheetal we can easily get out ofthis confusion... gradually."
ARer that evemhing will be all right.
And then...
it will be all bed of roses!
But this outcome won't come byjust sitting at home.
"We must meet, and keep meeting."
But I don't want to meet you.
Since when have you started lying?
"An_ay, dump these odd talks."
They are unyielding.
I am free tomorrow.
Why don't we make it tomorrow then?
That's final. I'll see you at Golden Chariot tomorrow.
I don't want to meet you.
-See you at 4 in the evening.
Keep waiting.
I won't come.
No way.
I had said I wasn't coming.
"Uh, sir?"
"Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now."
"I don't want to be, but I am."
If you don't come forward...
"I don't know, I might have to."
"Well, I guess we're each gonna do what we have to do."
"I can say anything to you, right, dad?"
"Well, this is the last thing you need to know,"
The thing you're never gonna get
To help me deal with.
"This thing that's been living inside me,"
"This cloud that I can't get out from under,"
"It's always been there, but it started to get worse"
During my senior year of high school.
Kim and I went to this party.
It was mostly college kids home for their christmas break.
There was a boy there.
His name was william.
"He was a little older, cute, funny."
"I liked him, so I pretended to be older."
He kept giving me drinks.
"I started to feel funny,"
So he asked me if I needed to lie down.
He helped me upstairs.
And the rest?
"Well, you're defending him now;"
you know what he does.
I was barely awake for any of it.
All I knew the next day
Was that something sick had happened to me.
"When I read about your case in the papers,"
"When I realized how many other girls he'd done it to,"
When has that every stopped you?
I need to connect more with Lucas.
I thought you guys were already doing that.
"I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far."
Can you help a girl out?
Yeah.
You know what?
Give him this.
Travis.
"Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him."
Great.
"Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?"
Just friends.
"I know, sorry."
You're a goddess.
Did you finish 'The Little Prince'?
"No, I just rented the movie."
This book is stupid.
"Nathan, you're not going to pass French if you keep renting movies."
"Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read."
"So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?"
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.
"Wow, what did you say?"
I didn't know what to say.
Nobody's ever asked me that question.
"Wow, that's really big."
"This last couple of weeks without it,"
I mean if I didn't play I might actually have a life.
- What would you do?
- I don't know.
At least I'd have some time to figure it out though.
"Besides, I'm sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?"
"He hit me with rod, non-stop hitting..."
He hit from the left and then from the right...
He wanted to use a pair of swords to kill me.
I haven't seen these evidence before.
They are our new discoveries.
"To kill a person, why should he bring along so many weapons?"
That strongly proved that he was well-planned to kill Chun.
He even wanted to kill innocent citizen.
"Even though, he didn't mind to die with all."
Bull shit!
You creeper!
"You are framing me, you will die a dog's death!"
Bastard!
You will go to hell!
"Your Honour, I request to charge Foon with some more charges... threatening judiciary officer, contempt of court, bodily injury, and throw rubbish in public place."
Chan Mon-gut.
"I didn't do it, I didn't do it."
Don't lose your mind.
Why did you throw my shoe away?
Give me back my shoe.
Take this first.
Super swords!
Capital Chopper!
I smell something weird.
What's this?
Cat's stool.
Why are you that hungry?
It may be very important clues.
"Brother Lone, what made you think so?"
Because of my name.
I made many clues.
How about that shoe?
Time is money!
You can't just wrap a gas hose around your neck every morning!
You need this fine little device.
"And if war reparations have left you with anything, it's that head on your shoulders that tells you that you need this!"
"Come out of the street, young man."
"If you get run over, who'll clean up the mess?"
"Buy my wares, ladies and gentlemen."
The price is right:
"One for 20, three for 50."
"It won't snap, split or break."
"Don't laugh, folks."
I just wanted to show you how sturdy and solid it is.
"Just 20 for one, 50 for three."
Here's your chance at a real deal!
"One for 20, three for 50."
Cilly!
So nice of you to come by!
I'll get my things and be right back.
I'll wait here.
"You know, Franz, you'd make a good family man:"
"Nightgown, felt slippers, the whole thing."
Something wrong with that?
You'll never get anywhere like that!
Wait and see.
Lots of guys are worse off.
They end up on the dole or get locked up out at Tegel.
What's gotten into you?
You're cozy here.
You can do anything you want.
Listen.
I have something for you.
What is it?
"Oh, dear, oh, dear."
"There you are, the senior partner's lot-- disobedience and insubordination."
James?
- What?
"Oh, sorry."
You're looking despondent.
"Not ailing, are you?"
I do feel a bit under the weather.
"Touch of flu, perhaps?"
- No.
Or is it melancholy-- a feeling of mea culpa?
What do you mean?
- Paul cotterell?
"Don't explode, James."
"I know how reticent you are about private matters, but it is Paul's death that's troubling you, isn't it?"
Yes.
"- You can't carry the burdens of the world, especially not a world that's tearing itself apart like ours is."
"He was in despair after I put his dog down, and I can't help feeling that's why he took his own life."
You've got to accept it.
He was a very sick man.
"Come on, snap out of it, or do you want me to get Helen to sort you out?"
"Oh, no, thanks."
That is more than I can take.
Ah-choo!
- Aha!
"Our seasonal friend, I'll hazard."
You hazard away.
"This winter, I stay germ-free."
I'm off on my visits.
"Likewise, me to surgery."
"Wrap up warm, James, and..."
"Stay away from the cold, empty place..."
- Next week.
- That's what I thought.
- I thought you were on later.
- I heard what happened.
- I thought we might need help.
"- Actually, we only got the one."
Three went straight to the morgue.
- Sorry I didn't come by last night.
- It's okay.
Maggie and I played Scrabble.
I got a 75-point word.
- Really?
"- ""Cyanotic."" She challenged it."
...found brutally murdered early this morning inside of this establishment.
Doc Magoo's a diner frequented by staff and visitors of County General Hospital.
The crime was committed prior to opening as the staff was preparing for a day of serving the usual sandwiches and sodas.
What got served instead was a cold-blooded robbery-homicide in which four people were murdered execution-style.
- One of them's still alive.
- Police are trying to identify suspects.
- More on the story later.
- Any word on Eric?
I don't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
He won't come out till spring.
"Hey, what do you say we go out tonight?"
Sushi.
Just you and me.
- Maggie can fend for herself.
- Told her I'd drive her to the bus station.
- She's leaving?
- Yep.
- Is that a good thing?
"And I'm a monster, too."
"But you're human, Kiefer."
"In here, I can rule as the king of the Kingdom of Afternoon Naps."
"Kiefer, go outside and..."
"Now I know why I fell for you, Ryner."
"Because you were so unmotivated, I never felt like I had to be cautious around you."
I could be at ease.
"That's what I thought, but I was wrong."
It's really because you're kind.
And... because you're strong.
"Ryner, you're no monster."
I guarantee it.
"Thank you, Ryner."
I'll live on.
"And mark my words, I'll..."
I'm going.
Open up.
That surprised me.
I thought I was going to suffocate.
What's wrong?
Are you injured?
A little.
"Are you a fool, volunteering to be imprisoned?"
It was hard getting a visitation here.
You didn't have to bother.
"I'm just being kept in a prison cell instead of a school, now."
When I close my heart
When I close my heart What's this?
When I close my heart I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
To the scent of impending darkness I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
"To the scent of impending darkness If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
"A refrain of a far-off day of resurrection If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
- No.
- Why not?
That's really none of your business.
(Tractor horn plays Dixie)
"Just pull over here, Mr Anderson, and let's talk a little business."
What about instalments?
I could maybe find a deposit.
"No, these things are selling like hot cakes."
I don't really do credit.
"Look, you're a lawyer, right, like Mr Kingdom?"
"That's right, yes."
"My son David and his girlfriend are looking to buy their own place, and I was thinking I might like to help them, by lending them the money."
Very generous spirited of you.
"So, look, why don't you do me a nice quick loan agreement, watertight, and I will let you buy a Whizz."
"An agreement that David can't get out of, that ties him down."
"If you want the car, I'm the only one round here who can help you."
"So, you'll be wanting to say yes."
It's a deal!
(Hums happily)
"Yeah, mate, just click Accept and you're done."
The PayPal account's Millington Consultants.
"OK, bye."
- What are you doing?
(Sighs) I need a Wii.
What?
No-one's stopping you.
"No, a Nintendo Wii."
Seventh generation games console.
"But it's pricey, so I need to make some cash."
- Doing what?
- Tech support.
"""Too thick or old to work your PC?"
When is a man safe from such wit.

"""Memories of your kindness must sustain me."
And I remain -
"- Your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars."""
- Why hasn't he come?
"- He says he's busy, dear."
- He said he'd come.
Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.
I fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.
- You must miss him.
Elinor.
"- We are not engaged, Mamma."
"- But he loves you, dearest."
- I am by no means assured of that.
"And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -"
- To his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.
- It can't be good for me.
- It is.
Stop complaining.
"Weird lights, strange phone calls, you."
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
"Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
"Well, what I meant was, well, you know how important this is to me."
"I think I told you, Mr. Norstaad, that I've been in South America for a good many years, and I've been out of the construction game."
This is my chance to get going again.
"And if you both like the plan, then maybe the Hospital Committee and the others--"
Of course they like it.
Of course you get job.
Just you watch how Edie pushes this through.
Nowhere in the world is another woman like--
"Please, Axel."
Oh.
Of course.
"It gets late, and we should take ourselves home."
"Oh, Miss Morrow, you might like to point out to the Committee that the design for the hospital conforms perfectly to the topography of the land."
"Oh, land."
"Yeah, Edie, you pay over deposit money already?"
"No, not yet."
"But Maigret, he says--"
Don't worry.
"I just thought it was better if Mr. Somers replaced his $50,000 personal check with a certified one, that's all."
"He said he'd have it for me tomorrow, and I'll see it goes directly into escrow."
Good.
"Fine, fine."
"Good night, Edie."
"Good night, Axel."
"Good night, Miss Morrow."
Much obliged for everything.
"I mean it, darling."
You've handled everything just perfectly.
"Good night, Mr. Reed."
[pounding on door]
"All right, all right."
Coming!
Stop the boat.
"The planes where intercepted at the clandestine airfield,"
I caught them like wasps in a nest!
you caught them...
"We caught them, Inspector."
"Eh...well, yeah, we caught them."
"Well then, no need to argue, I will treat you to a bottle of champagne at the bar, shall we?"
Lets.
The End

"NARRATOR""."
When last we saw the Caped Crusaders they were trapped in Black Widow's giant cobweb about to be bitten by two deadly Black Widow spiders.
Are the heroes headed for that great Batcave in the sky?
"In scant seconds, the answer will be yours."
"Batman, he's almost on me."
"He is a she, Robin."
Only the female of the species is venomous.
And mine is almost upon me also.
I've freed my right hand.
Now if I can just reach the mini charge in my utility belt.
I've got it.
"Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin."
We'll be stunned for a split second.
"But the cobweb will act as a conductor, and the spiders will be electrocuted."
"- Hurry, Batman."
She's ready to bite me.
-Now.
"Good going, Batman."
I thought we were dead ducks.
I'm sure Black Widow thinks we're dead bats about now.
What was that exit line of hers?
NICK:
You want me to go undercover as what?
A member of the 12-step program.
"Aw, come on, captain."
"It makes sense, Nick."
"You weren't at the crime scene, and..."
Nobody knows you're a cop.
"There's a bit of a catch-22 here, captain."
I know.
Your vacation.
"Look, I wouldn't have called you in if I didn't need you."
Tell him.
"They're stonewalling, Nick."
Nobody wants to say diddly about the victim because it's part of their code or something.
It's a dead end.
Unless I become one of them.
Got any bad habits?
Maybe it'd do you some good.
"Nat, what do you think of 12-step programs?"
I think they can be very helpful for some mortal addictions.
How about the more exotic ones?
You know my theory about that.
It's the blood that keeps you from coming over.
"I try, Nat."
"I really do, I really try."
Do you think a 12-step can make me give it up?
"No one can answer that for you, Nick, but it wouldn't hurt you to give it a shot."
When I came here three years ago...
"I was on my knees, almost literally."
I felt like a complete and total failure as a human being.
I hated myself.
I couldn't see any way out of my addiction.
I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- That's not important.
"What is important, however, is that you tell no one."
That was the mistake that Jeremy's predecessor made.
I'II be in touch.
- Nice bunch?
- Mm.
(Man on radio) A suspected gas explosion wrought havoc in Little Stempington.
No one was hurt in The Wicker Barn but fire officers are counting occupants lucky.
"Got a space for you right here, Mrs HazIedine."
How do you know my name?
And isn't that a disabled parking space?
Don't you worry about them.
"Most of them are faking it, especially the ones in shopping scooters."
I make 'em park round the back.
Do that again and I'II piss in your petrol tank!
"Nobody hoots at Mrs HazIedine, you fucking fuck."
Now take your ration book and fuck off home!
It's quite all right.
I am holding up the traffic.
"Under control, Mrs HazIedine."
"When you've finished, give me a shout and I'II have someone load your car."
"Good morning, Mrs HazIedine."
"Peter Astbury, store manager."
"And this is douglas, your personal shopper for today."
"That'II be £8.50, please, Mrs HazIedine."
There must be some mistake.
"Oh, er, I'm sorry, er, that's er, 5... £4.20."
Just £4.
I'm very sorry.
There's about £70 worth of shopping here.
- Dunnett.
- Major Dunnett.
It means going a hundred miles into occupied French territory.
"Care to come along, Sharpe?"
- But...
- Good.
"Tomorrow, I go on ahead."
Alone.
"It attracts less attention and gives me a chance to contact my Spanish agents who are searching, too."
"A small special force of Rifles attached to Dunnett's force will travel a day behind, in case I need help."
"That's where you come in, Richard."
Want you to command the sharp shooters
Sir Arthur.
The men you will be commanding must know nothing of this mission in case of capture.
"That is a secret shared between you and your superior officers,"
Major Dunnett and Captain Murray
"Whatever happens, one of you must get through to Casa Antigua."
You'll find them camped about three miles north of here.
They like to live rough.
They expect you at dawn tomorrow.
Give this to Captain Murray.
"Major Dunnett is an officer of the old school, Sharpe."
He may not erm...
He may not approve of my raising an officer from the ranks
"Yes, sir."
He may not erm... mind his manners.
So you must mind yours.
Sir.
"Good luck, Mr Sharpe."
Er Richard
The shilling.
"Will he do, Hogan?"
"Well, so much for not forcing our gunman's hand."
Just when I thought things couldn't get any more interesting.
You have no idea.
Tony's dad is on that London flight.
Come on.
Figure it out.
Who's the target on the plane?
Who's the hit man?
Let's talk possible hit people first.
We have a Joseph McBride.
"He's 49, from Springfield, Virginia."
He's a lobbyist for a chemical company.
Next.
"Ruth Potts, 62, Fairfax, retired schoolteacher, who wouldn't hurt a fly, obviously."
Just look at that sweet lady.
Next.
Thanks.
"Boss, I got 'em."
Manifests for 17 different inbound flights arriving to Dulles tonight.
"Okay, divvy 'em up."
Deal me in as well.
We are looking for a target significant enough to warrant killing a federal air marshal.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the extended delay,"
TSA is now required to perform a second routine screening.
"We apologize for any inconvenience, but we'll begin with Calgary flight 3184."
"If those passengers could calmly line up over there, please?"
Thank you.
"TSA isn't saying anything about landing order, Gibbs."
"They're all low on fuel, so... it's first come, first serve."
"Stay alert, Bishop."
We're watching.
Okay.
"Well, if you're implying that mr."
Stark would ever...
I'm implying you.
Mr. Stark's on the run.
He is also...
An innocent man.
I can see why he hired you.
"You're smart, cool-headed, extremely loyal,"
"Which is surprising,"
Considering you were charged with treason.
There you go.
Stay on him.
"Oh, yeah."
It's right here.
There's not much in there.
But seeing as whatever you did's
"Been swept under a rug, I'm guessing"
"It's a big green one made of stark money, hmm?"
So you dodged the treason conviction.
But you couldn't get out of the dishonorable discharge.
"Well, I guess money can't buy everything."
This looks bad...
"Bad to every good man who ever served,"
"Bad to your friends, neighbors..."
And to the fine folks at the office of immigration.
"Yeah, I'm putting that on the table."
That'll be a fun conversation to have with the wife.
Yeah?
"""honey, pack a bag."
"""spot of bother."
"We're being deported."""
you know what?
Tse-tse fly can kill you.
What?
Just drinking coffee.
To what do I owe this honor?
- Is this a bad time?
"- No, I just really need to sit down."
Much better...
Do you see a clean towel over there?
- Honestly...
Not really.
- Never mind.
What's up?
I wanna say thank you for what you did for us at the...
- carnival.
- I go where I'm needed.
That's what makes me superhero.
I know I haven't really been that super to you in the past.
"Are you in some kind of 12-step program, or something?"
"Unless they started a one for idiots, who, stripted their lavaliere and are having a hard time getting over it."
I can give you some pointers there.
Not that I've had ex boyfriends.
"What I wanna say, Cap', is that I'm hoping you and I can... start over."
Be friends.
"We've definitely tried the other thing, right?"
"With a lot of fun, but not much success."
"Friend Cappie, at your service."
Thank you.
What don't you tell me what you really came here for?
- Why do you assume...
"- Cause even though we're startin' over, we're not really."
I know you.
Fair enough.

"Hey, can I talk to you about something?"
It's a little awkward.
I know what this is about.
"Given the professional standstill you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching."
Yes.
"And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines."
"Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history."
One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things.
"You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back."
You could have fun with that.
"Yeah, that's not it."
Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
"Oh, of course he is."
She's very interesting.
"Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
No.
He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.
"I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard."
I don't own Amy.
Can't own a person.
At least not since... 1863.
President Lincoln freed the...
I've made a deal with Jacob.
You should be happy.
"If you're so bored, get another job or a hobby."
Instead of going around making my life hell.
"Fine, as long as I get peace."
Helene!
I must admit it got a little wet.
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- It takes more than that.
- How about a drink?
- It's a little early.
"I've changed the plans a little, so it will take a few more days."
Why?
I can't do that.
I need to be back in two days.
Listen.
Instead of an annual donation -
- I've talked to my advisors about establishing a fund.
It means something to all of us that you're Anna's biological father.
So I'm establishing the fund in Anna's and your name.
You two will decide how the money is spent.
So you've chosen my project?
- I just said that.
- And you want me to do it with Anna?
"Yes, why not?"
She has shown a great interest in aid work.
My advisors have gone through everything and agree   that a sum of 12 million dollars is realistic.
- 12 million dollars?
- I know the dollar is low.
All kidding aside.
"You can quickly see   that it will cover a whole year for 65,000 children."
"Including room, board, school and administration."
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me."
"I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah."
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.
What's his name?
"They call him ""Bellosh."""
Belloq.
Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
"Well, they're not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy... there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark.
"If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb."
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
"Do we need the monkey, huh?"
"I'm surprised at you, Jones- talking that way about our baby."
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I looked around... he was gone.
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-like arms and legs."
"And his green face, like a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-believe stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-believe, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you..."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""Please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao. """
"What'll you do, Grandma?"
I'll go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
All right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Not me.
You.
Island Hoppers is going to sponsor you in the Iron Man.
"Oh, no."
No way.
A person's gotta be crazy to enter that event.
Mm-hmm.
That makes you the perfect candidate.
"Besides, look at the difference in our bodies."
"I mean, I'm all shiny, muscle and power."
But you...
you got the legs to win it.
That's right!
And I intend to keep them.
"I mean, think about this, T.C."
"Swimming, running a marathon and then bicycling a hundred miles."
All right.
"What-What-What about all this """" I owe you one, T.C.""?"
When does that get paid?
"Well, that's different."
"I mean, that's entirely different."
Vouchers.
What about vouchers?
"Vouchers for... for gas, vouchers for air time, vouchers for this, vouchers for that."
When are you gonna take care of that?
"I'd do it, T.C. I really would, but, see, I'm on a case with Barbara here."
Ah.
"Now, I've had occasion during the past 24 hours to scrutinize the body in question."
- Mediocre reflexes...
- Mediocre?
Average motor skills...
"""where moth and rust doth corrupt,"" Matthew, 6:19, but it's a handy little case is that."
And a record come with it.
Shall I put it on so we know how we have to do it tomorrow?
Are you allowed to play it?
Yeah.

Does it not matter what I say?
Get inside!
"Mam, we were just..."
You were just showing me up.
You can leave that.
What are you going to do with it?
I might put it in the bin.
"Don't, Mam!"
No.
"No, I couldn't."
"Saturday, I gotta work."
"Sunday, I'm going to a picnic."
"Well, no, I couldn't take you."
It's not exactly a picnic.
Some fellas and I are going fishing.
"Yeah, I'll call you up sometime."
Goodbye.
I see by the paper they're having a sale of vacuum cleaners down at the fair.
I think I'll get you one.
Plenty of time for that.
When will you know about the job for sure?
I ought to hear from the super tomorrow.
"After I get the vacuum, I'm gonna get you a new coat."
I think maybe we can doll this house up a little bit.
Maybe we can get rid of that heap and get us a real car.
Do you think we should?
The old car runs all right.
"I got the swellest wife and kid in the world, ain't I?"
And the best ain't none too good for them.
"That's swell of you, honey, but we gotta pay the folks that helped us when you were out of work."
"- Oh, we'll clean that up in no time."
- Ha-ha.
"- Yeah, I think maybe we ought to get some new dishes too."
"Hey, Pop, come on."
You're missing out on Speed Foster.
What's he doing?
Still hanging on by his teeth?
"Yeah, but he's in terrible danger."
"Go ahead, darling."
Hang on by your teeth and I'll hang on to the dishes.
- Where are the movies?
- They're getting away.
- Somebody get a rope!
- Let's season 'em!
- Have we crossed into enemy territory?
- I hope so.
- Where the hell is Klinger?
- At last.
A friendly face.
I knew this would happen.
Klinger would be back with our cosmetics by now... if you hadn't sent him off on a wild-fish chase!
You've completely destroyed the morale in this camp.
Let me know if that crowd gets out of control so I can go out there and egg 'em on.
- I take it you haven't heard from Klinger.
"- No, but I'm sure... we'll get a postcard from Toledo any day now."
"Oh, come on, Colonel."
Just 'cause he's a little late?
You call it late.
I call it permanently skedaddled.
How could you three-day suckers give Klinger a blank pass?
That's like the warden asking Willie Sutton to lock up the hoosegow.
"- Colonel, you're just jumping to conclusions."
"- Well,jump on this."
He took his footlocker with him.
Ayear's change of duds to go with his change of scenery.
- You dopes!
- You idiots!
[ Horn Honking ]
- [ All Cheering ] - [ Hawkeye ] What took you so long?
"Please, please."
An artiste cannot be rushed.
"- There you go, sir."
Where's Danny?
- Danny just left.
- Ah.
Damn it.
- And wait for it.
"Hey, I just got your text that Justin is here."
I also saw him run right past me.
Which one should I trust?
"Yeah, I know."
I love you.
I have to tell you this.
And I know you don't like this sappy stuff.
You're going to act like you don't care.
Alright you know what?
"Look, stop."
"Let me go first, OK?"
It's only fair.
"Shelly, why don't you tell him where I was while I go wash up?"
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Gather around, everybody, and hear the tale."
Now when I told Danny we couldn't get your ring back... he took it upon himself to go back to the strip club and get it from Trent.
"But when he got there,"
Trent and Kevin were so nervous because there was some big league stripper scouts there from the biggest area in the world.
"That's right, Will, Tampa."
You know about this Will.
I know you.
I seen you at the club.
"Now the problem was that they didn't have a third dancer, and what happened next, oh, is gonna go down in male stripper history."
Wow.
"Guys, if we die tonight, I just want the world to know we died doing what we love."
Yeah.
"I don't really want the world or anyone to ever know that I was here, but."
Sure...
But this is not the most important thing in life.
What is most important in life?
To live in harmony with yourself and feel free.
We seem to have problems with that.
You're wrong.
This is the first place I have felt truly free.
"You're joking, aren't you?"
No.
You only value what you lose forever.
We have lost the illusion of freedom.
But we were never free in reality.
We had some troubles and communal inconveniences.
Freedom is the ability not to depend on circumstances.
It is the ability to think.
It is victory over your fears.
Do you ever feel fear?
Sometimes.
Freedom has nothing to do with bars and locks.
Somebody gave an order to do away with me.
Who did it?
My business partner?
He has been dreaming of getting rid of me for a long time.
Sell the control package of shares.
The Americans are offering great money for it.
Sell your shares to me.
I'll buy them.
May be it was Marmazin?
He is an oil-trader.
He is an authority.
"- Hey, bro!"
- He feeds the cops from his hand.
Maybe they're pack animals and they're marking me for later.
I don't know.
"Dave, I was in a car accident once, okay?"
"And it was really scary, I had nightmares."
But when...
"I've been in a car accident, too."
Have you ever been bit by a shark?
I was never bit by a shark.
I'm just saying that I understand.
My...
Say it again.
I was in a car accident.
"No, say the last part."
I was never bit by a shark.
That's it!
Then you shouldn't talk about it.
And I'm not gonna sit here and try to explain myself to a bunch of black and white suburban trash who don't know a damn thing about the ocean.
"And you understand the ocean, honey?"
"I have some real field experience, honey, yeah."
I had a shark attack.
I'm part of a very elite group.
Like people who have been struck by lightning.
Not everyone can say that they've had that and maybe that's what's going on here today.
You know what?
I don't want to get in an argument with it.
I really don't.
You know what?
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.
I'm gonna go back to the room.
You want to come with me?
"Baby, I thought we were gonna go to the waterfall tonight and have a little alone time."
The telegram arrived in the morning from Gyula's obituary.
Gyuri got confused totally.
Because it occurred to him that a field postcard came to Tót's address in the today's post.
He remembered well.
Gyula wrote it.
Gyuri did not understand it.
He thought that who can write a postcard may not be dead.
"So, not the telegram valid, but the postcard."
Tót family!
Lajos uncle!
Good news!
A half year was not his so good day!
"Do not bellow, you."
The major lord sleeps yet.
Show me.
- The child.
- Let me see.
Dear my parents and Ágika!
I write this postcard on the railway station.
The train of the major lord before with 5 minutes went away.
"Imagine, the a half year was not so good I day."
"I took a bath and drank beer, the major lord was very kind."
"Please, be cordial to major lord, you make big good one with this for me."
Gyula.
"Ow, let there not be something wrong with him only."
From the cold beer caught cold always.
Do not be scared.
He can look after himself.
Drink.
Well onto..the your kind son's health.
"According to the hygiene that ideal one, if somebody is 8 hours sleeps daily."
"But for who he has to work day and night, in is needed let it have him with 5-10 stole minutes."
You lost him?
!
"Forgive us, sir."
You are hired killers for heaven sakes!
How could you let him get away?
"Yi Soon-shin, that weasel slipped away..."
But there's only one place he could've gone.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What happened?
"My lady, we must quickly move him inside!"
Father...
"I do not know what happened, so I brought him here away from the eyes of the others."
You did the smart thing.
Gatekeeper!
"What brings you here at this late hour, Baron?"
"Forgive me, sir."
I have reasons to believe that a thief that broke into my house tonight is hiding in this house.
You've been misinformed.
No one entered my house tonight.
It's possible that he is hiding here without your knowledge.
"I hate to impose, but please allow me to take a look around."
This will be my last and only request.
Very well.
As you wish.
This is my daughter's room.
Please allow us to take a look.
Even the father is careful about entering a maiden's room.
Don't you know the customs of the nobility?
"But sir, I am acting on a testimony of a witness."
I must assume that the thief is in that room if you tell me to leave.
- Come in.
Gotta be freeway scavengers.
Headed south on the Golden State.
Attention all units.
The contaminated baby food dropped from the truck this morning was possibly picked up and carried off in a converted school bus.
The bus is described as pre-1960 still official yellow color.
The lettering has been painted over.
"When last seen, a canvas tarpaulin tied to its roof."
"Well, they could be anywhere."
It's late.
They gotta stop to camp for the night.
There aren't many places a vehicle like that can stop.
They usually can't afford the regular trailer camps.
"You know, they stop up in the Santa Monica canyons a lot."
Yeah.
They use the open areas alongside the road to camp.
"Okay, right."
You two take Topanga Canyon.
I'll send other units to help.
"Barkley, take Malibu Canyon, all right?"
Hold it.
There's an accident this side of the tunnel.
Took an hour to get a tow truck up.
Another one's hung up there.
It's a big mess.
Motor's the only way through.
"Okay, you go."
"And you two better go too, since you know what it looks like."
"- Make sure you hit the side roads, right?"
- Okay.
There's a rest area up ahead.
I'll take it.
I'll ask over here.
You will be connected to the voice mail after the beep.
"To record a message, press one."
"Please speak after the beep, then press the star or pound key."
I see you're not picking up.
"That day, I think I had too much on my mind and I was a bit afraid."
"Actually, I'm sure of myself, but I didn't do you right."
I called you because the sea is so beautiful.
There are so many idiots who take life for granted.
"In this beautiful place I've seen people fight over some money, and a couple argue."
It's disgusting.
You're beautiful.
Very beautiful.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm a film director.
"Oh yes, my name is Kim Joongrae."
"If you're not busy, could I interview you?"
An interview?
"Yes, I'm working on a script."
And you look so much like one of the characters I'm creating.
"I'll offer you some compensation, though very small."
"Oh, no need for it."
I know who you are.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, you do?"
Thank you.
- What kind of interview is it?
- It's real simple.
"If it's okay with you,"
"I'd like to ask about your life, just everyday stuff."
"Actually, I'm not used to this kind of thing."
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we gonna meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we gonna meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.
Thank you.
"Eddie got ahold of something, he wouldn't let go."
Eddie Santos was a pit bull.
"Pit bulls are ugly, but they're not stupid."
What was he doing without backup?
It wasn't the first time he'd taken Tino down.
He'd never had a problem with him before.
"Somehow, Tino must have got the drop on him."
It happens.
Why didn't he tell anyone he was going up there?
Because it was his collar.
"He made that case against Tino, then the judge went south."
There is no way Tino Zapatti could have walked two years ago unless...

Stains like the blood on your teeth.
"Bite, chew, suck."
"I want to break it up, i want to smash it up, i want to fuck it up."
I want to watch it come down.
"Maybe afraid of it, let's discredit it, let's pick away at it."
I want to watch it come down.
Come fucking down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better ?
The pigs have won tonight.
Now they can all sleep soundly.
And everything is all right.

"Uh, yes."
It's my first trip.
Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me... and, uh, the middle of the ocean is the only place... where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."

Here's the rest of the warrants.
The court order's in there for the wiretaps.
Judge gave you 60 days on it.
Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"- Hey, look."
If this is the way you're comin' in on this... why don't you stay home and save us all a lot of grief?
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
"Bill, look."
Please...
Do me a favor.
Give them a chance.
He came in here with a little basic information.
I know you worked with him before.
Hey!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around drinking and feeling sorry for yourself.
What is this?
You won't respect yourself until someone else does?
I respect you.
You've got a lot of courage.
The whole department is waiting to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- They want to keep me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
"Will you go now, please?"
Just go home.
"No, I don't want to."
I don't want to go home.
What are you doing?
What made you decide to become a cop?
All the shit you've got to go through  being a woman and all.
"When I was in college, my roommate was raped."
The campus police were only interested in keeping it quiet.
I knew that the guy was white and very tall.
I started checking out basketball courts near the campus.
From the pictures I took of the white players she identified him.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the police.
Pull over and stop the engine.
Stop the car..!
Take the wheel.
"This is 9221 in pursuit of a murder suspect,   heading west on the railroad service road at mile 16."
Why say that he kissed the earth on which I walked?
"Kill me, you needed."
I am so tired.
"Rest, rest!"
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
"No, it's not true."
"I am an actress, you ..."
"Even he is here, si ..."
"But it does nothing,"
"Did not believe him at the theater, is a mockery of my dreams, and I finished to cease to believe it too."
"I have lost the courage, the torments of love, jealousy ... the constant fear for my child."
"I became a petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know that what to do with my hands, nor as being in the scene."
No longer controlling my voice!
Do not know what means this situation.
It's good for me.
Learn to bring your cross.
It preserves your faith.
I have faith ...
- And the suffering.
- This is ridiculous.

Perhaps to die?

Angela´s mother and I went out last year. lt´s over.
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"She calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby and that I´m the father, and that she´s in trouble and she can´t handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
- But you told Chloe.
- Chloe and my sister have been helping me.
She´s a good friend.
Excuse me.
"Chase, you wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up."
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I´m just as confused as you are."
"But all I know is that I love you, and I´m falling in love with Angela, too, and I need to make this work."
Go on.
Hey.
- What´s happening with Nina?
- They´re getting something.
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deep.
You better hope she´s not spinning your wheels cos she can manipulate our protocol.
- Tony knows what he´s doing.
- Fine.
I need to get together with Chloe.
I need everything she´s got on Amador.
- Not yet.
"- Ryan, you´re wasting my time."
I humoured you with the physical.
"We both know there´ll be trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general´s office is here to talk to you.
- This is not the time.
"- Actually, it is."
"You´ll talk to her, then we´ll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
"From the information I see, they already received money for food."
Why are they still saying they're starving?
How is it possible?
"They probably spent the money somewhere else, that's why they're saying they're hungry."
"The children say they do not want to be treated as beggars, so they don't want to take it."
Children these days really like to lie.
Don't be fooled.
"There are many children like this, who lie and instead spend their money at the internet café."
What if it is you?
"If it was you, would you choose to starve or to play games?"
What?
!
You!
Who are you?
What are you doing?
You... you!
Me?
I hate seeing children go hungry.
The people have paid so much taxes.
I want to know why children are still starving.
That... what is that?
Are you implying that I pocketed the money?
I'm not sure who is lying.
This is really strange.
I said that you're the one.
"No matter what, please get them corrected after your confirmation."
I need to use the restroom.

"If you betray me, you must give up your political dream."
So you can't betray me.
You must properly punish Lee Kyeong Wan.
Who are you?
"Bos, did you pack the micro cam?"
I did.
"Well, sync me up."
Care to share?
Cruise director's going to greet the guests at the casino.
- Good to know.

Good luck.

Check out contestant number two.
- We've I.D.'D Roman's bidders.
- Is there a pattern?
"Well, the thinner guy's Ivan Dunski."
He's got ties to the Russian mafia.
"And the barracuda is Erica Leone, attorney for the east coast's biggest racketeers."
"The other guy, Juan molina, is the leading Cuban drug trafficker."
Roman's dealing out his keycards to some faces.
- Faces?
- Legitimate names who front for big shots in organized crime.
"From Kate's passenger manifest search, she's identified four possible bidders."
- Three of them have already been to the casino.
- Who's the last bidder?
Ricardo Stancati.
Accountant with Detroit mob ties.
Keeps an ultra-low profile.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.

"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-gu!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...

What kind of twisted freak is he?
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
Byeong-gyu.
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-gu turns up dead two days ago."
So?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
"Lucy, you go first."
I want you to look at Joey and say hi.
"And Joey, after you've heard that,"
I want you to look back at Lucy and say hello in return.
"And then we'll just see where it goes from there, okay?"
Hi.
Hello.
"You kept saying ""open"" and ""fruitful"" and other weird stuff."
"That's not feeling, it's just more talking in short half-sentences, and you managed to turn feeling into a job or an activity, and it was exhausting."
So now it's my fault that you don't feel satisfied!
Everything is my fault?
Is that what you're saying?
I'm not saying that!
I'm crazy?
You don't look at me!
You don't ever ask me how I am!
I work!
You haven't looked at me in 10 years!
"I'm crazy and everything is my fault, and my family is awful, and nothing at all is your fault!"
"'Cause you rock, Joey!"
"If a guy talked to me like that, I'd punch him in the face."
You're such an asshole!

The dawning of a new day.
A marriage is not a timeless agreement.
It is one day.
The only way to get past it is to erase Aaron.
"What do you mean,"
"""We're going to erase Aaron?"""
"When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone."
"Roger, Elena, you."
I need to map out my brain and lock all those memories away.
Away?
Away where?
Here.
This is an imprint of my current neural map.
"Once I pass Everclear,"
I need you to connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back.
You'll only have a few days to do it or Aaron will be gone for good.
If that thing doesn't lobotomize you completely first.
I'm just temporarily disconnecting some circuits.
Aaron isn't a circuit.
It's who you are.
But he's not who I need to be right now.
This is gonna sting.

Strap me in.

So now what?
"Just, uh, flip a switch and say, ""Bye, bye, Aaron."""
Either that or this thing turns me into a vegetable.
Relax.

At least that's the idea.

"Tired, right?"
This is no joke.
Mom wasted two hours.
Why was there no shoot afterwards today?
It's a really busy studio.
There's no reason for me to be dragged around anymore.
You said you didn't want an outdoor shoot.
Dunk your legs in some warm water and rest up.
You should go to a sauna too.
Can't you just take some work off?
There's not much time left.
I'll do what I can.
"Jo Eun Young, please come in."
"Lee Seo Yeon, please come in."
Yes.
"Hello, doctor."
"Yes, take a seat."
I'll put it back when I leave.
"Oh, right."
They're going to use it as a villa and a work space.
"They've been investing money into the land but it hasn't raised in value for years, so his painter wife begged for a villa."
He's a painter?
The wife is.
"It's the wife's wish to live in the country and paint, and the husband also wants to put the main focus on her workshop."
"They're going to be living half the year in Seoul, half in the country."
The wife isn't your typical woman.
She even brought a wish list.
Thank you.
"All right, first, she wants a big workshop and a deck that leads out of it."
The deck needs to be spacious.
"The kitchen also needs to be big, and the living room should extend to the roof."
"If you're worried about Neil falling in love with someone the way I fell in love with you, that's like worrying about being struck by lightning."

"You'll get your contract as soon as the party's over,"
"Bastion is in the clear, and we go our separate ways."
"Oh, are we breaking up?"
"If I'd have known, I would have insisted on being your date tonight."
Break up sex is the best kind.

Yes.

Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, René."
Your persistence surprises even me.
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your Führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.

"I should've been, too, but they made me a lousy private."

"- He's right, you know."
- This man's army is very discriminating.
You bet it is.
"You got a lot of nerve, buddy."
"Look, pal, I don't make the rules around here."
"If the service isn't your cup of joe, fine."

You know what?
"Can we please, please, please just go to the concert?"
We can argue in the car.
It's what Dave and I do.
you know this is... a work for me tonight.
Thank you.
"Since we're winding down with the game... oh, I didn't get you... the bow and everything."
"""Tin men"" and ""Avalon."""
"It's the rest of the ""Diner"" trilogy."
"Yeah, I know exactly what it is."
And this madness between us is a curse...
I don't wanna fight.
- I don't wanna fight either.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am sensitive because...
I don't know much about babies.
"Every time I hold one, they start crying."
"I mean, it's like they...can sense my fear."
It's not gonna be that way with your own baby.
I swear.
You'll be amazed.
No... brother...
"Jeeya Jee is like my child no, not like child, she is my child."
"Muna, Papu what are you doing, when ever i call you, you come."
"Get out from here, don't you have any other work, Shut up!"
Now greet and get lost.
Or i will shoot you right here.
You don't worry your brother is with you.
And you never told me that you know big don of Mumbai.
"Not to worry, from today if there is any work for me, ask me."
"Here's the money, bubble gum... get lost!"
"Go Munday go... wow, you did well acting for a underworld don."
Munday ran away... but where this gum came from?
I am Bhai (brother) of Underworld for real... i am bhai (brother)
For real?
You are Bhai (brother)
Son...
Son...
Laxmi Narayan is my father and i am his son.
"Here Father, Son and Uncle... 3 type of Laxmi Narayan are here."
So which one you want Sir?
"Sir, can you get me to there room."
"God knows, after Sono's mom, i turned off all my feelings"
you have tune on them again.
"I call sister, every women."
"I told you the size of bra, by seeing but i have never seen anyone with bad eye."
You have left me for nowhere.
You has told to show it?
"So i am undergarment saler, what i elss i would look for?"
"You do business in car, right?"
Yeah i do business in car!
Is it wrong?
Selling undergarments in car?
My ex-husband would never agree to any of that.
The lady doth protest too much.
I haven't mentioned your ex-husband.
You're going after my ex-husband unless I cooperate?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Hold on.
I haven't made any threats.
I'm the one who needs help here.
"Okay, what exactly do you want?"
What have you got?
Who were the Atlantor players?
What was the chain of command?
Who is this Miles Drentell?
- Who interfaced with the community?
- Other people were bribed?
Did any witnesses lose interest?
How good are your records?
- Very good.
- Like you never throw anything away.
"Well, I have been called a pack rat on occasion."
By your ex-husband?
No.
That's the pot calling the kettle black.
You still like him.
Excuse me?
Did I say that?
I'm sorry...
Can I see these records?
You'll see everything that I find appropriate for you to see.
Wait.
"Remember, if I take the big guys down, this project goes down with them."
I understand.
The cops find it and the bastard gets it back.
In tip-top shape.
"He drives off happy as a clam, whistling away only what he doesn't know is we've fiddled with his car."
Unscrewed the front wheel.
Is just hanging on by a thread and not for long...
One day he's driving down a nice straight road going over a hundred smoking a manly cigarette a Marlboro...
"Then, all of a sudden..."
off comes the wheel...
How's that grab you?
Right on a curve...
Trees all over!
Absolutely!
The bastard asked for it!
You must be tired...
Why don't you sit down?
Since we'll probably never see you again we'd like to ask you for a favor.
Come on...
I'll be late to work.
"Well, les hear it..."
We'd like to touch you for good luck.
"OK, but make it quick!"
I don't want any trouble at work.
I never heard about is being so lucky...
Sure it is!
Touching something dirty brings good luck.
Like stepping in shit.
You bastards!
"Sure you're in the right place, Sonny?"
Got one for me?
Got a nice trim there around the ears...
Watch out or I'll trim yours!
Saturday haircut day?
"You know, Horace, it's time."
It's time for you to claim a fucking life.
"You sat out the first half, now it's time of you to make something of whatever time you fucking have left."
- I didn't sit out my life.
"- No, no, you most certainly did."
"You and fucking Pete, both you guys."
"You guys together, like, you were half a guy each."
"Together, you didn't didn't even add up to a whole."
"Now, he is gone."
You have a chance to be a person.
"To live a fucking life, I don't care, Horace, Iâm saying all of it."
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
"I don't know, Iâm sorry."
"- Okay, well, there's something you need to know, brother."
Iâm leaving.
- You are?
"- Yes, Iâm going."
Iâm getting the fuck out of here.
"You can do what you want, but Harold and I are leaving town on Monday and that's it."
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
- Where?
- Where-- I don't know where.
"See the country or whatever, just-- Just not here, though."
- You're telling me that now?
"- Yes, now."
"Yes, now, Horace."
This is all you fucking have is right now.
Do you understand?
"I almost died and I got my fucking life back, and Iâm not spending it here, there's no fucking way."
"I hope you don't either, Horace."
Perhaps he began to hit the bottle?
It's all right if you don't want to tell.
"Oh, my God..."
"Nina, is that you?"
- Hi.
"- Oh, howdy!"
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.
I just dropped by to...
Why not?
You're still the master of the house.
"We have no masters here anymore, we had done away with masters back in 1917, so..."
"- Look, you goat."
- I beg your pardon?
"I mean, have you no conscience?"
Conscience?
No conscience.
"That's why you walk and whistle, lost your cap and don't give a thistle."
"You know, I've never understood those metaphors of yours."
"So you, the bandit, don't give a damn about your daughter, right?"
This is too serious a subject.
We'd better leave it for later.
"For now, let me take some things that are precious to me."
So you've come for precious things!
Not in the sense you mean.
Precious in the spiritual sense of the word.
- You'll do without.
- What do you mean?
Come when Nina's here.
You mean when the she-goat's here?
"Please don't misunderstand me, but if, as you put it, I'm a goat, then, naturally, my wife is a she-goat."
Oh boy!
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dr. Masters."
Yeah.
And now I've kept you here so late.
You must be starving.
There's still-- there's still Chinese in the fridge.
How about I make you a plate?
You probably shouldn't let yourself in here anymore.
Sorry.
"Uh, I can leave my key if you want."
"What are you doing here, Libby?"
"It was my day on the meal rotation, and I thought you might like some braised chicken."
"But maybe I shouldn't be so presumptuous, reading your mind about what you... might want."
"Well, what do you want?"
You.
You were right.
I am-
- I am so sick of pretending all the time.
This is where I want to be.
I don't tell people that-- what a mess everything was when I was growing up.
"Well, a sad childhood is not something people often discuss."
I won't even tell my boyfriends.
"Although some of mine, they actually ended up being like my father."
That's a--
A common phenomenon.
I even felt it a bit when you were angry with me just then.
Felt it?
It made me... drawn to you.
"Well, you know, it's good that you can catch yourself now when you see those patterns repeating."
And it's good I have someone I can talk to about it.
Yes.
"That's good, too."
"- Shut your mouth, Sergeant!"
"- Go find a medic, Jimmy."
"Bring morphine, I'll take the responsibility."
Him?
He's Italian!
"That's an American soldier there, Captain!"
"Now listen, Sergeant!"
That man is a Captain with more experience than either of us.
We're going to do what he says.
and follow his orders.
I'll take full responsibility!
"We have to distract him, to do something... so he doesn't realize he's dying."
There's only one thing we can do.
"Listen idiot, if you're wrong about this... if that doctor doesn't come..."
"I'll rip your guts out just like his, got that?"
Now hurry it up.
"Well now Prewitt, you're lucky."
You're going home...
Just wet his lips.
"You know, I always thought you were lucky..."
"Prewitt, but this was surprising."
The ambulance will be here in a few minutes.
A few days with pretty nurses bending over in front of you... and resting their tits on your shoulder... and then you're on a plane headed to the USA.
"Isn't that right, Kaminsky?"
"Keep talking, Sergeant."
Leave that idiot here.
He's stuck in this stinking country.
"-Não é, amigo?"
"-É, goma de mascar!"
- Guido!
- Yankee!
Fag.
"Driving a yellow convertible with the top down, dressed like assholes!"
Yo.
Yo.
"Yo, look, he has one of these things."
- Would you put that down?
"- No, you can hook up to the Internet."
You can play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!
on it.
King Hippo's going down.
Put that away.
Put that away.
"I can't believe you can even think about playing games at a time like this, man."
You realize what would happen if our parents found out about this?
You have sent our sons to Guantánamo Bay?
This is an outrage!
"You Arabs think you can just mix in with our peaceful society... and we're not gonna find you, huh?"
I am not Arab!
I am Indian!
"Look, Chief."
"I'm not here to argue seblantics with you, OK?"
I'm here to save lives.
Ask the Lees what they know about their son's terrorist activity.
"Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years."
"Now, frankly, I find this very offensive."
They're using some sort of dialect I've never heard before.
But I'm pretty sure he said something about going on the offensive.
"Tell them we know what their son is up to... and if they don't cooperate, he could be sentenced to death."
Hit 'em.
Yeah.
We know what he said!
"Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys."
He's supposed to be in medical school.
- I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
- That's what they do with killers.
- I'll see you around.
"- Come on, let's go."
"When I grow up, I'd love to have a pair of shorts like that."
"- How's your wife, Eddie?"
- None of your fucking business.
How would you know...
"You're his partner, how's his wife?"
"Eddie's picking on me again, Uncle Nick."
One of these days it's just going to be you and me!
Workers discovered the nude body wrapped in a sheet.
She was identified as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
"Miss Putnam, a stewardess, was abducted from her home,   then taken to another location, where she was murdered."
The brutal crime reminds many of the Polish Hillstranglings.
There's no connection other than the victim being a white female.
"The Polish Hill victims were strangled, not shot at close range."
- You picked the wrong house to rob.
- You got nothing worth stealing.
- It's been a long time.
- I could've killed you.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You did.
Give me a drink.
Why do you live on a houseboat?
You and your old man should've burned this place down.
- How was California?
- Sunny.
Sunny?
You're out there two years and that's all you can tell me?
"""The Simpsons"" are on an hour earlier."
Are you still mad at me?
You haven't shed it yet.
Now who's on their back?
What the hell is going on?
Get your scurvy asses back down below.
You have to go now.
Go.
Go.
Keep your gun on them all.
Where'd he go?
He fell overboard.
He'll do well to survive with that wound he has.
Then good riddance.
"Well, at least they're stuck here a while longer while they fix our ship."
I don't think Atkins and his men will travel too far into the jungle anymore.
"Today, the battle may have been lost."
But the war is far from over.
"Have faith, my friend."
We will get you home.
Come.
Ripped By mstoll
You just fell for the oldest trick in the book!
And what book is that?
How to defeat the boastful warrior in one easy move.
"Well, then, you had better press home the advantage before it is too late."
But you're weaponless and flat on your back.
Really?
That makes it 3 hits to me.
"And to you... uh, none."
Who's that?
"Jacob, it's hotter than hell in here, and full of stinging things."
"You're my brother, nolan."
- I don't think we should talk about classes.
"Like, if-if you're taking playwriting with Sam Shepard,"
"It may hurt my heart,"
"But if you take intro to mime, I need to know everything."
I want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret.
Playwriting competitions-
"I think we can go out for the same ones,"
But we can't read each other's submissions.
"And looking forward, I guess it's the same thing"
With internships and jobs.
So the only things we can talk about openly
"Are-are politics,"
"""jersey shore""..."
And where we want to eat...
"Which reminds me, I actually,"
"Um, I need to get ready."
I'm gonna be late for breakfast at my dad's.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
"No, I'm sorry."
"I, uh, I have something."
"Oh, oh, is it something related to our list?"
"Actually, yeah."
"Well, thank you for not sharing."
See?
I can't believe how much easier that is.
Ooh!
Another sext session with your new b.F.?
"Okay, I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend."
Between me spending all my time with my mom
"And him being in every club in school,"
We haven't even been on a first date.
Hey.
♪ To face the world
♪ Out on my own again
♪ You put me high
♪ Upon a pedestal
♪ So high that I could almost see eternity ♪
♪ You needed me
♪ You needed me... (song ends)
(sniffles)
"Some hardcore (bleep), right?"
"Wow, thank you for turning me on to something so amazing."
"Hey, I'm just glad you enjoyed it."
And I'm sure Buzz Lightyear would have enjoyed it if he had bothered to show up.
"Hey, how would you like to go to my apartment... and beyond?"
"Okay, Meg, I stood outside"
Planned Parenthood for 36 hours and here are the pictures of every girl in your class who went in.
"All right, good."
Now I want you to call them as if you're their dead baby.
"No way, that was the last thing on your list."
I-I can't do this anymore.
"Well, you should've thought of that before you stole money out of Mom's purse."
I own you.
"Now, here's my post office key."
I need you to go downtown and get the stuff from my P.O. box.
You-you don't get your mail here?
"No, I get a lot of private correspondence from the Netherlands."
Like what?
"Like, I'm part of a group that kind of trashes Anne Frank's house every year."
You know what?
No.
That's it.
"I'm not-I'm not doing any more of your crap, Meg."
"Chris, don't you see?"
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the... chapter that you have."
on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
"I tried to stop my mother, but she insisted on giving an elopement party."
Which is a first for New Jersey.
I would be paranoid to assume the blue sedan was following Barbara and me.
There were plenty of other people on the bus.
But private investigators are paid to be paranoid.
So I made a mental note to check for the car when we came out.
I wonder if Barbara realized just how careful I was being on her behalf.
"- Yes, Mr. Masters?"
"- Hi, Higgins."
It's me.
"Magnum, why must you always call me on Robin Masters's private line... when there are four other perfectly good phone lines into the estate?"
"Well, it's the only number that I can remember."
"Um, Higgins, can I have the Ferrari?"
- You're asking?
- Of course I'm asking.
"This isn't like you, Magnum."
Not like you at all.
"Well, I..."
I need it delivered.
Delivered?
"Look, Higgins, I only have 24... 23 hours to solve this case that I'm on, and I can't do it riding around on a bus."
A bus?
You're on a case and you're riding on a bus?
"Don't laugh, Higgins."
Some of your best investigators use buses.
Buses can't be tailed.
You can always spot a tail when you're riding on a bus.
"Oh, Magnum!"
"This is too, too much."
"Just get me the Ferrari, Higgins."
I'm at...
Honolulu Lulu's.
What I really wanna do is just play basketball.
Basketball?
"I love it, always have."
I never miss a game on TV-- when my Dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"Dude, you should do that."
You should join the basketball team right now.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my Dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your Dad what you want."
Really?
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents."
Go to your Dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
"You know, you're right."
I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.
Sweet.
"Sit up properly, Bridon."
You know how strict your father is about posture.
"All right, dear, dinner's ready."
"Okay, let's eat!"
"Dad, I need to talk to you about something."
"Ooh, that sounds emotional!"
# What is it son #
# What's on your mind #
"# Whatever it is, you know your Dad has the time #"
"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
# If you can talk it you can sing it #
# You can lay down the rhythm and bring it #
Why should I wanna rise above it?
Because its standards are low.
Its people spend their time trying to drag each other down.
I don't want to be perfect.
I don't want to live in a test tube.
"I just want to be me, and have some fun, and have some friends."
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.
"By liked, you mean being pawed by an animal with one thing on his mind."
Don't make it sound like that.
"Everything has to be learned, even kissing."
And sex?
Is that what you're going to practice at your next party?
You keep trying to accuse me of things I'm not even thinking about.
I don't want you to get a reputation for a half-hour's carelessness.
I already have one.
The wrong kind.
"I want you to fall in love and at the proper time, to marry a man who respects you."
I want you to have a good name.
I want...
You want!
You want!
You want!
Is that all you can say?
"Well, if any man would ask me, I'd run away and become his mistress."
Don't you ever let me hear you say a thing like that again!
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said it.
Allison.
"Hello, Trudy."
"- Hello, Allison."
"- Hello, Joey."
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
"Then keep to it, if that's what's written."
Keep exactly to what is in the score.
Careful!
Here you made a mistake in the fingering.
This bar once more!
"Careful, a mistake in intonation!"
"The first mistake was at the beginning, these notes are long."
"This is a faster tempo, here we shorten the notes."
We'll speed it up a bit.
The other problem is this point.
"I couldn't practise much, we have visitors at home, I couldn't make so much noise."
"And could you let me go now, because the whole family is going to granddad's grave."
His brother's come.
What will you do at the cemetery?
I don't know.
Pay our respects.
This young boy has an id card.
"Everyone has, it can't be helped."
You must have some proof of identity.
She left it at home.
But they know me.
Haven't you got something from school?
You think I'm not fifteen?
Look how grown up she is.
"She is, that's not the point."
"If I've got an id card, she has too."
Must we always have it with us?
What's written on that board?
Young people under fifteen must show their id cards.
"Her age isn't written on her face, she must carry it all the time."
I always have to have it with me?
I can't help it.
That means I'll have chance to see you again!
"If it's not necessary to return it, I prefer keeping it."
"I can't be his woman,"
"I can't win his heart, now, I love to keep it for memory."
"Miss Shui, why do you like my master?"
"All women want to find a husband who is capable, a man who can protect her."
"Miss Shui, if there is a man, who is a bit stronger than you, but he can protect you, will you consider him?"
"People always look for the best, if I can't find a good husband,"
I prefer not marrying anyone else.
What a decent woman!
Bravo!
"Foon, a man should achieve something in his life."
"You'd better forget loving affair, the world will be your oyster, you'd fight for your future."
Where should I go to fight for my future?
Isn't it all the go?
Yeah...
Really?
Let me take a look!
Isn't it popular in Britain now?
What?
See!
What do you mean?
Look at me!
Look at my look!
Oh!
Look!
You speak fluent English.
It's wise of me to let you study in Britain.
I'm right to bring this present to you.
See!
You look really smart.
Even a deaf guy can hear that... you spoke whole-heartedly.
The president was the leader of the sweep mission?
Does this make sense!
?
These are records of Mr. President's political slush funds.
Very detailed.
With these named councilmen here.
In order to pass the Private School Reform Bill.
He even made a certain deal.
This is breaking news.
Run.
Private School Reform Bill results.
For: 228 votes.
Against: 41 votes.
Abstention: 5 votes.
I pronounce that Private School Reform Bill is passed.
It passed.
Finally it's passed!
Are you that happy?
"Of course, I'm happy."
"Agent Kim, you also relied on yourself to study, right?"
Yes...
This is something that should have happened sooner.
Come on in.
Mr. President...
Something big happened.
President Choi Eung Chan's Use of Illegal Campaign Funds Revealed.
President Choi Eung Chan...
"While he was trying to pass the Private School Reform Bill,"
"He caused damaged to the separation of legal, administrative, and judicial powers."
And not only did he shake the foundation of democratic society.
The Sweep Mission in the past as well.
He concealed it and deceived the citizens.
So you have to look for the open spaces.
"It's really dangerous, but basically, you have to, like..."
"You have to just get, like, aggressive in there."
You know how it is.
"You know, you're like, ""oh, this guy's gonna lag back?"""
"I'm like, ""I will totally get in there."
"You're taunting me."""
"You know, it's like all this stuff."
Do you watch to see who's on the phone
- 'cause you know you can totally jump in front of them?
"- Oh, yeah."
I take photos of license plates when I see people on the phone.
"I'm like, ""amateur hour!"
"Get the [Bleep] Out of my way!"""
That's what I would have said.
You can edit that out.
"Now, as a woman with style, I feel like you probably can tell a lot about a guy by his car."
Right.
What would you think about a guy in a Corvette?
What kind?
What year?
"Let's say a Corvette Convertible, yellow, 2010."
It's not gonna be for me.
That's okay.
[ Laughter ]
"A little older, and then it's sort of ironic and funny."
"And then I'm like, ""this guy's got a great sense of humor."""
Is he wearing...
[ Laughter ]
"""He's got a great sense of humor."
""" Yeah."
Is he wearing a chain?
Let's give it another 15 seconds.
"Doyou want to sit down... together sometime, like with coffee or something?"
Yeah.
"Well, if you everfeel too old to drive, just call that number."
I can't hear you!
- Is she of color?
- And do you love me?
No.
But she's a woman.
Even though I am sometimes irritating?
And a little bit selfish!
"Oh, her."
Even when I forget to ask you how your day was?
"Yeah, okay."
Didn't we already show a local person this year?
I don't think she's ready.
Let's go to slides.
I really do love you-
"All right, what we need to ask ourselves... about each one of these is:"
"Could this have been made in any era, or only now?"
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
"Okay, what does this tell us about digital culture?"
I don't think this tells us anything about digital culture.
I think you're right.
Let me guess.
This one's about AIDS.
"Yeah, it's not really on the theme, right?"
And we already have photography.
"You know, we have those photos and e-mails."
E-mail wouldn't even exist if it weren't for AIDS.
Fear of contamination.
You're home.
Did you see that there was an attempted robbery at the new mall?
I'm glad I cancelled jack's photos.
I just decided I wanted you to be there.
It's better if we do it as a family.
Is everything ok?
"Yeah,everything's perfect."
"Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to learn the most important lessons of life, one must each day surmount a fear."
When did you know you were gonna have to trick him?
The first time I talked to him.
You realized you couldn't break him?
"Well,I realized he was too smart to have had that nextel phone registered to him accidentally."
He drew us there.
He wanted our presence at gitmo to confirm that he was successful.
And that's when you started moving up the time of his prayers.
"If I'd used an actual clock, he might have caught on."
So it was all a chess game.
We won this round... but you heard him.
Jihad never ends.
Mate.
I quit.
Yield.
Surrender.
Capitulate.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Prentiss.
Sir?
You play?
"Okay, these are for school-- lunch and two snacks-- one to eat, one to trade."
"Oh, and this is for dinner in case your dad makes that chicken thing with the cherries."
- Hello.
I think I will have to strangle them first.
That takes too much energy.
Just push them off from somewhere high.
What about you?
I hate autographs of people who have nothing but money.
"He says he's busy, and he won't even give me time to interview him."
All the data I have is 200 pages of blabber full of spelling mistakes.
He makes it so obvious that he's ignorant.
And I'm just a con girl making 800 pages from it.
It's so annoying.
And depressing.
You should write your stuff now.
I don't think I ever will.
I messed it all up from re-writing.
I can't even write 3 lines in an hour.
I can only write cheap lines.
I can't do it.
Don't do anything for 3 years.
It will come back.
Sounds great!
What am I going to eat?
Tap water and air?
I'll feed you.
I don't have talent anyways.
I'm just going to make a living.
How can you win twice without talent?
There are plenty of writers who win that contest and have nothing to write.
"Anyways, I'm a writer too."
That's how I get paid more for re-writing.
It's ridiculous.
"Oh yeah, I got a new client yesterday, so I paid aunt back."
Ain't I great?
"Say, you're right!"
"Round up the board of directors, we got to have a meeting."
"Jimmy, my boy!"
Josie.
I knew she'd bring us luck.
"All i could find, boss, was the night shift directors."
Send them in.
"Come in, folks."
"You can leave the pail outside, mrs."
Callahan.
"Sam, will you sit there?"
"Arthur, you sit at the head of the table."
"Mrs. Callahan, would you mind taking that seat?"
"All right, we have a quorum."
"We'll dispense with the reading of the minutes and the roll call, and hear the treasurer's report."
I ain't got no report to make.
But i move that the board of directors authorize this company to issue
$10 million worth of convertible bonds.
I second the motion.
I third it.
"All those in favor will signify by saying ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
Motion is carried.
Look at this mop.
It's the only one i've got.
I don't think i ought to vote for that 10 million till i get a new one.
"Chairman, i move that we convert these bonds into common stock for public sale."
I second the motion.
"When I was inside, nothing happened."
When I was out it was all there to read on the front page.
"Yes, I read all the papers."
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.
"Your mother always wanted you to do it, but what finally decided you?"
"Well, I was riding along on the top of a bus looking down, passing the cathedral."
"- That gave you the idea, huh?"
"That's funny, I got an idea on the top of a bus once."
Got me six years.
I was around while you were singing with the kids and I kept thinking of you and me 20 years ago.
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.
"Remember slipping ""Merry Oldsmobile"" into the hymnbook?"
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?
"Lead, kindly light Amid the encircling gloom"
"Lead thou me on, for the night is dark And I am far from..."
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did.
Certainly did.
Come in.
"Father, you're supposed to be down at the store."
The fellas are waiting for you.
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.
"- Okay, Father!"
- All right.
What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?
"That's not a bad idea, Rocky."
No.
"- The 21st century, no smoking... in office buildings, go out on the street with the rest of the junkies."
Spank me again!
I think there's a part-time position opening at the vault.
Let's look in here.
Maybe we'll find some naughty toys.
He doesn't exactly seem like the kiddie-porn type.
"He's such a sweetie, gorgeous!"
I wished he was into sausages...
I think I'll never be graced by his sweet ass.
- You mean Paul's no gay?
"- Your ""gaydar"" is failing."
Paul is as straight as Mark Jacob's pleat.
- Interesting!
- Every fashion magazine... needs their token hetero male.
It's like reverse feminine action.
Fuck!
I gotta dash.
I'm off that Palm press.
I think Judaism beats Buddhism... in the next century.
I really do.
And I've got the jump-start.
- I'm taking kabala classes.
- I'm sure I've seen sketches of a...
- Moses collection come cross my desk.
"- Wait a minute, haven't you seen..."
- at Skirt magazine?
"- Please, darling!"
Are they finally eclipsing Vogue in fashion for advance?
Skirt will only race clean when it shows the bat about one ways.
It's true!
They totally missed the ball on those princess skirts.
That's because Roxanne Rochett is Coco.
"Okay, let's just focus on the positive, okay?"
- Mm-hmm.
"- I mean, I just got out of a relationship too, we've never been single at the same time, this could be fun."
"- Ah, I don't know."
"- No, it'll be good."
"You guys can go to clubs, and you can do ""special k,"""
"and, um, you can have sex with European backpackers."
"Okay, I haven't been single in a while."
You know what?
You guys are right.
I've got to get out of this apartment.
Take my mind off of him.
"Yes, yes, see?"
"Good, we'll go out tonight."
Yes.
"I mean, I'm already buzzed and wearing spanx."
I think that's the name of Chelsea handler's new book.
"Hmm, yeah."
Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience.
"Don't lie, staying with me has been pretty awesome, right?"
"Yeah, this couch is surprisingly comfortable."
"Come on, dude, we both know you're not here for the couch."
You're here because your heart just got its ass kicked.
Right in the balls.
"And of all the people that you know, you came to me."
"Well, I didn't want to impose on Alex and Whitney, and..."
Bup bup bup bup bup.
I'm just happy somebody finally recognized
I'm the emotional go-to guy for our group.
I was actually just about to say that I...
Shh.
"Look, I used to be just like you, okay?"
His car number is MRX 4060.
"Sylvia, he alone is poised to win this year's derby."
"I'm sory Mr Daaga, Prakash couldn't deliver your gold to the right man."
Prakash?
Who Prakash?
I found your telephone number and address on him.
Are you talking about the Prakash who fell to death from a train?
"Yes, I remember. I read about him in the newspapers."
I am delighted to hear that you read newspapers.
But why did he keep my telephone number and address?
He could have told you.
Your misfortune.
He is dead.
The news of his death was a false news spread by us to cheat you.
He isn't dead.
He's alive and kicking.
He is alive?
And he has testified in the hospital itself.
"Don't you fret, Mr Daaga."
Prakash is dead.
I just wanted to see the change in colour ofyour face.
"These things are trivial, Inspector."
The court asks for evidence.
And as long as the police doesn't find any evidence against us it can't even shake us.
Little mouths don't open in front of elders.
Understand?
"Inspector Vijay, you have insulted my man."
I can sue you for this in Court.
"Well, Mr Daaga, you will have to produce evidence for this smack."
How can I help you in this matter?
Vijay is a close friend ofyours.
He is.
"Here's the thing, you need to protect your family."
OK ?
"Policies start at $250,000."
We offer term or whole life.
You really can't go wrong.
"Think about it, Sally."
"People don't plan to fail, but they do fail to plan."
It's great to see you.
"Sir, may I talk with you for a minute ?"
"Yeah, officer."
What can I do you for ?
You lost your name tag.
I didn't go to this school.
So you go to reunions for the sheer fun of it ?
What is that ?
What is that ?
"Oh, it's a mortality clock."
It shows you how many seconds you have left on this Earth.
"You factor in age, habits, height and weight, and statistics tell the rest."
But the class of '90's going to start dropping around 2055.
So you sell life insurance at the reunion ?
It's a perfect place.
People are all focused on their fading youth.
"I know, it's sleazy, but it's working."
I go to class reunions all over the state.
Our detective said he saw you talking to the victim's wife.
I was consoling her.
How are you holding up ?
Patrick was taken much too soon.
"Jennie, yeah, I wanted to see how she was doing."
I met her when I sold her a policy.
- She bought a policy ?
"That isn't the case here, is it, Mr. Morris?"
Or were you even aware it was going on?
"Uh, we live on a ranch, so Georgie does chores."
"In fact, we all do chores."
She happens to love being out with the horses before school in the morning.
It's part of her routine and we couldn't stop her if we tried.
So I would hardly call it hard labour.
That's insulting.
"No one's accusing you of anything, Mr. Morris."
These are standard questions for clarification.
"Right, well, I don't think you'd have to ask these questions if you'd done any homework and found out anything about us."
How can you take these complaints at face value like this?
Honestly.
It's ridiculous.
I've done everything that's required of me.
Let's get the next one ready for the shoot.
Whoa!
Settle down there.
Whoa...
- All right.
- That's it.
- How many is this?
- Five more to go.
Whoa... there.
Thanks for keeping him calm.
"You know, this is what I miss the most."
Us working together.
"It's what we always wanted, right?"
It was a dream.
Maybe we just keep it at that.
"Oh no, he's back."
Matt is gonna see him!
There was no ransom to be paid
"No song unsung, no wine untasted"
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
(SOBBING)
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
(SOBBING)
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed!
Now
Life has killed the dream
I dreamed
Have you anywhere to go?
No?
You need to get warm.
(FANTINE COUGHING)
BAMATABOIS:
What do you have for me?
PIMP:
"Here's our youngest, sir."
(SINGING) I don't want you
"You've got some nerve, you little slut."
- Won't pick up.
"Kid's pink, sat's fine."
24 gauge going on in the right.
"You want me to take this, Kerry?"
I don't mind.
"What, you think I'm rusty?"
"Superficial head lacs, no step-offs, left frontal-parietal hematoma."
Call CT and let them know we need a head.
Finally calming down.
Or going apnic.
"Come on, baby."
Wake up.
Wake up.
"All right, uh, Inez, miller one and a 4-O."
She needs a tube.
"Kerry, the kid's screaming."
The airway is obviously fine.
She's got a good mechanism for a head injury and she needs a CT.
"So what you're going to subject her to the risks of intubation, just to make it easier for the radiologist?"
- She'll settle down.
Give her some time.
- She doesn't have time.
Agitation could be an early sign of head injury.
Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
Babies cry when they're scared.
"Thank you, but this is my patient."
Her mental status is waxing and waning.
She could go apnic in the scanner.
You bag her through it.
.5 of versed and vec.
Hold on.
You're going to lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
"Pardon me, dear Father, I beseech you."
"Henceforward, I will live beneath your rule."
"Well said, my daughter."
"If you should find Romeo in morbid grief or feverish, these herbs will make him well."
Be sure he's strong to take the journey home.
But do not fear.
My letter will revive him.
"Give me your blessing, and I will be gone."
God speed your path and keep you safe from harm.
"Nurse, here is the key to fetch more spices."
The cook wants dates and quinces for the pies.
We must a-move on.
Paris will be here.
"Get anything we need, spare not the cost."
"My lady and my lord, get you some rest or you will not survive the wedding feast."
What nonsense!
I've been up all night before for lesser cause than this.
And I know why.
And look to have no repetition now.
A wife still jealous after all these years?
"Why, 'tis compliment enough to give me cheer."
Hmm?
Hmm?
Wife!
Nurse!
- Will nobody obey me?
!
"- Oh, peace, peace!"
Go waken Juliet.
Dress her and trim her.
"Pray, bring her down to compliment the bridegroom in his choice."
Hmm.
Bored?
How do you get bored with that?
"For every beautiful woman, there's at least one guy out there..."
... who'stiredof pretendingtolisten to her in exchange for sex.
"Well, let me go on record as saying, I am not that guy."
"If I ever had a woman like that, I would cherish her."
I would worship her. I would...
... starta smallcountryand put her  face on a stamp so I could lick her head.
-Why don't you go talk to her.
"-Yeah, right."
Gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me...
... unlesswe'rein line for the British throne.
-So you give up without even trying?
-Yep.
That's my motto.
Why waste time on 1 0s when you're already getting rejected by sixes?
"Alan, listen to me."
"You are a smart, sensitive, good-looking man..."
... withsomemilkydischarge coming out of one eye...
... butwhoamongstusisperfect?
That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
So?
"Women like Sherri have big, hunky guys hitting on them all day long."
"A guy like you walks up, makes a move, you know what that says to her?"
Trick or treat?
"It says, ""l'm confident in who I am. """
-You think?
-l know.
"So, what if she's not interested."
What's the worst that could happen?
"Actually, the worst that could happen is she points at me..."
Are you calling for the President's daughter?
Oh how come you...?
Just saw her in a ceremony before.
I just saw her go to that side.
It should be okay now.
Let's leave.
Why... do you plan to leave now?
Go where?
I came out because I have a headache.
Let's go inside now.
I really appreciate your help.
If it wasn't for you...
Just thinking about it is scary.
That's right.
"That woman just now, her contact method,"
Maybe that unlucky person will know.
Unlucky person?
"Yesterday, did you or didn't you lose her?"
We lost her.
I heard you were doing well in training.
"If this continues, how can I let you be bodyguards in the US?"
What did I tell you?
I said her character is really different.
Don't tell me you didn't know what that meant!
We will note that.
"For her protection, intervals should be avoided and she should be followed closely."
Maybe you guys think you should not be blamed and I should pity you because you are young.
"But, her father is the president."
=There's a call.=
=There are two messages.=
For you.
"Hey, it's cold."
"A heavy price, as is often that of the honourable choice."
"Let the gods show us the way, then."
"If Gannicus proves himself against Crixus, he shall remain."
"Yet if he falls, he shall leave this house, following the others that have failed to honour it."
Dominus.
I am to be sold to fucking Tullius?
Only if you fall.
Clear mind.
Prove yourself the man I know you to be.
Doctore.
Let us begin.
And know who truly stands champion of this house.
Crixus.
Gannicus.
Take position.
A second chance to prove myself against you.
- The gods have heard my prayers.
- And they curse you in the answering.
Begin.
"Father, we're near ready to leave."
Pause a moment and see contest ended.
Finish preparations.
Crixus again shows form.
As does Gannicus.
Both men you have often praised.
Perhaps you have learned something after all these years.
Perhaps.
You have lost sense.
All attention is upon the match.
No one will notice your absence for many hours.
They will brand me fugitivus!
They will not find you.
He was not in his sense!
As if he was mad!
Because of his wifes death!
"Krishna, no one knows where Mr. Kumar is!"
But its really nice to see you back.
I am carrying a burden on my mind!
Now I am really relieved!
"But Mr. NagpaI, how did this happen to you?"
"Yourwife has died, your daughter became widow."
And I started suffering from cancer!
What?
This is how a sinner repays his sins!
The fire that started in your bosss factory was not accidental!
"Krishna, I have started that fire because.."
..Dhanraj paid me to do so!
I had started that fire!
Dhanraj!
"Airport, now we have to play a new role in our life."
We have to meet every one of sirs enemies!
With new avatar and a new identity!
"Yeah, we have to revenge sir and sister-in-Iaw!"
We have to revenge the injustice that happened to them!
And we swearthat unless and until we..
"..bosss destruction, we will not think about anything else."
Brother Ravi!
Brother Ravi!
"What is it, Vicky?"
Why are you shouting?
You wiIIjump forjoy once I will let you know the news!
"Brother, exporter has come with orders.."
..worth crores of rupees!
If we can get our hands on one order..
Not the kind of makeup that women use in the street.
Pancake.
Women very often use a brand of makeup that's made up for actors like pancake.
"I, for example, use precisely that product myself."
"Yes, sir."
I know.
Yes.
I'm sure you do by now.
"No, but the point here is something else, sir."
"You see, the lab found traces of four different shades of makeup on that mask."
"And women, you know, they don't usually change shades that much."
"So, in the light of that, sir, I got to thinking."
Where did it lead you to this time?
"A guess, sir."
A professional makeup man?
"Right, sir."
And then to my makeup table.
"Oh, no, sir."
"No, sir."
No.
I only came here to see you.
Honest.
I was just fooling around with the shoes just to pass the time for something to do until you came in.
No.
I didn't look at another thing while I was here.
That means you didn't have to.
You already know something.
Where did you look?
"Guess, sir."
I'll give you three guesses.
The studio wardrobe department.
"You got it in one, sir."
"I just saw the rest of my life, and there were no more surprises."
This was it.
"I mean, it was great..."
But it was it.
What makes you think this isn't gonna happen again?
- I know it won't.
"- Oh, right."
Come on!
Aren't we supposed to be able to learn from our mistakes?
"I did something horrible, but I learned from it."
I met this little brunette and I faltered.
Are you telling me that throughout your entire marriage you never faltered?
You haven't?
Never?
- Never.
"- Oh, that makes me feel great."
You think it's because I wasn't tempted?
You think that this woman is the last brunette that's ever gonna let you know that she wants you?
Look at me.
I haven't met my last brunette.
She's the last one I'm gonna kiss.
"I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen."
"And maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm standing here."
You're her father.
"I'm looking you in the eyes and I'm telling you,"
I will do anything in the world to get your daughter back.
- Really?
Anything?
- I'll do anything.
- People say that.
They don't mean it.
- But I mean it.
It's damn filthy here!
The furniture and the mattresses are all covered in dust.
You beat those out before it starts snowing again...
"Can I do anything else for you, dear Anna?"
"Yes, make it so clean here that one can eat from the floor!"
- Before Karl returns home again...
- When does he come then?
"Then he'll ask me again what you have done in the meantime, and I can lie again..."
"Oh, Mrs John."
I'll get the child right away.
Mother's already in bed...
- Is Mr Hassenreuter there?
"- No, how come?"
Mrs John!
Good evening.
Mrs Knobbe!
"I'm so grateful to you, Mrs John."
That you can look after the little one for a few hours at least.
- It has to stay somewhere.
- Its neverending coughing and crying never lets me sleep.
I have to be on duty at night...
Won't you take a seat?
And all that after the difficult birth!
It's a blessing that it's so dark in the bar.
"Tell me, Mrs Knobbe, for how long have you been staying in bed?"
"For six days, Mrs John!"
Six days and then it's:
"""Out, we need the bed!"""
"Having children is no illness, says the health service."
Not the slightest consideration.
"When it comes to paying, they squeeze everyone."
But he won't let himself be squeezed...
"They're justsoft, chicken-shit faggots."
They don't have the long-term vision anymore.
They justwantto covertheir ass and meet girls and tear each other down.
"Oh, God, this country's in deep, deep, deep trouble, Buddy."
"I have to see this through, you know."
Motherwould have expected no less of me.
"I'm sorry, Buddy."
"I justwish you knew how much I love you, that's all."
"Ittook me a long time to fall in love with you, Dick, but I did."
And it doesn't make you happy.
- You want them to love you.
"- No, I don't."
I'm notJack Kennedy.
"They neverwill, Dick."
"No matter howmany elections you win, they neverwill."
[Murmuring]
"Gentlemen, the president."
"All right, gentlemen."
This is our last damn leak.
It's no way to run a goddamn government.
We're going to prosecute the hell outof Ellsberg and any else who wants to leak.
"And, uh, that means anyone ofyou here who crosses the line,"
"I'm personally going afterthem, okay?"
The permissiveness ofthis year is over.
The belts are coming off and people are going to go to the woodshed.
'Cause the governmentcannotsurvive with a counter-government inside it.
I know howtraitors operate.
I've dealtwith them all ofmy life.
It's neverthe little people.
Little people do not leak.
"It's always some, uh, smooth son ofa bitch like Ellsberg."
"You know, the Harvard Hebrew boys... who leak."
"You can just tell him I was nuts, you know."
Stir-crazy.
Me?
I like a kid with some... with some get-up-and-go to him!
"I like a kid that knows all the answers, all the angles."
"Why, I like a kid that..."
H- how do you get out of here?
"Good luck, Joe."
"Hello, Joe."
I saw you delivering your boy.
Aren't you staying to take him over now?
"You're running out on him, eh?"
Getting big-hearted.
"That touches me, Joe."
I'm going to help you.
Start walking into the alley.
"Well, you've had a nice, long time to think about it, and now it's here, Joe."
Move on.
Now just stand there a minute and I'll give you something else to think about.
"So you're kind of bashful about letting people know he's your boy, are you?"
"Well, I'll do it for you, Joe."
"After I pump you full of this,"
I'm going to drop a little note to every newspaper in town.
Going to tell them about your boy.
Going to tell them what you don't seem so proud of anymore.
That he's Joe Krozac's son.
"All his little pals are going to know it from now on, Joe."
"No, you won't."
"Stay there, Joe, I haven't finished."
"They'll all know it, Joe, everybody."
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
Joe Krozac... subtitles resynched and adapted by cinephage from the TCM cc
It was my workplace went sour.
I was leaving Betty's Bees.
Did you tell Dusty you were leaving?
"If I told him, he would worry and ask a lot of questions and then I'd have to lie about sabotaging Betty's Bees."
- Why did you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Why?
Because Betty had it coming.
Intention was to quit before I got caught.
- Who caught you?
- I couldn't see his face.
Or her face.
All the lights went out one by one and then there was a terrible hum.
"Then, out of the darkness, it came for me."
"It spit something, and then a swarm of bees attacked."
I tried to get a good look at it but the bees were already stinging my eyes.
That's terrifying.
That's terrifying.
"Oh, sorry."
Five seconds.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Any last wishes?
- Only that Dusty not be alone.
Yeah.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- With a lot of might...
That's nice.
"We don't know what she was doing, but we do know it took a lot of effort."
Do you hear something?
- Is she still breathing?
- That's not breathing.
I told you not to turn her over.
Could that have happened to me on the roof?
"And just because I am a woman, they do not have the courtesy to tell me where they are going or when they will be back."
I'm a man.
That's right!
Which makes this even worse.
I'm going to Tony again.
(phone ringing)
We're doing our best to keep the investigation closed.
Clayton?
"Uh, no update yet, Mr. Wickes."
We're trying to keep this out of the press.
"The less our shooter knows, the better off we are."
"Okay, we're asking these people to not say anything about what they saw."
I saw a man with a gun.
"Right, I got that."
So you're going to be in this group.
"You're going to answer their questions, then you're going to go home."
Okay?
You're going to lay low and you're going to tell your people that you need some personal time.
"No, I don't want that."
I want him kept separate from the group.
He was standing next to Jarvis.
He had a better view than anybody.
"The gunman, he was wearing a blue hat."
I saw him.
"Okay, okay."
"We're going to put you with a sketch artist,"
You write down everything you remember.
"Of course, anything."
VANCE:
Gibbs.
"Massive blood loss, doesn't look good."
His family's been notified.
"Oh, Alice"
"Oh, Alice"
Oh!
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
No time for tears today No time for tears today
No time for tears today No time for tears today

"So much to gain, so much to lose"
So many things got in your way
"No time today, no time today"
Be careful not to lose your head
Remember what the dormouse said
Alice!
Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to Wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
"Alice, Alice, oh, Alice"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"

you haveNfinally lost your senses.
This venture is impossible.
the only wayNto achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
That kind of thinking could ruin you.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Jakarta...
The nightmare again?
I won't be long. then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
a smiling cat.
- merry christmas.
"- and merry christmas, kids!"
"now, you guys... i know i don't say this enough, but i love you more than anything in this entire world."
and that's why i named you after some of my favorite things -- cheez doodles.
[baby coos] skoal.
brandie.
- but you didn't name me.
"- i know, but i still like brandie."
and i love you like you're one of my own.
"'cause family is very important, okay?"
family is all we really got.
"and, harley, my angel."
you know i've always loved you the most.
i'm just kidding.
i love all you guys.
but i love you.
and this is for you.
"- thank you, mama."
- you're welcome.
"- * noel, noel"
- it's just a little something.
"- i love it, mama."
"- oh, don't go bs'ing me, boy."
"it's, uh -- it's supposed to be like when you -- [sighs] when you don't have something, but it's like -- it's like it means something, but it's... help me."
you know what i'm saying?
- a symbol?
- yes!
a symbol!
dang!
wayne must have been teaching you while i was out doing... doing my thing.
"so, that is supposed to remind you of where you've come from, but not where you're going, okay?"
and that's probably me in there with my feet up on the recliner after a hard day at girl curl -- just lazy.
Fucking Randy?
Didn't you say he was as funny as a dick pimple?
Randy open mic'd for three years before he got down here.
"You know, he didn't leapfrog 'cause he built some fucking shelves."
That deserves some respect.
You dig?
Yeah.
"Whatever, nigga."
You don't ever get to call me that.
"And if you roll your motherfucking eyes at me again, your head is gon' be rolling after it."
You understand that?
[Al] That's my time.
"Clap for me, please."
Mind the fucking light.
[cheers and applause] [laughter]
I know what you're thinking.
I look like Danny Partridge if his mom kicked him out of the band.
"Wonder if there were some family members that didn't pass the audition, you know?"
"Like, behind the long bus there's a little short bus."
"Poor kid, Patrick Partridge, sitting back there wondering,"
"""Why can't I shake the tambourine or hit the triangle or something?"""
I hear you're having dinner with Roy Brenner.
Yeah.
Somebody was harping in his ear.
Eh.
[laughs]
Thought I'd use the guy's pain.
Little inside information on Brenner.
He doesn't like hard to get.
So do me a favor and quit acting like you're doing him a favor.
You want this.
"You want it more than anyone, so woo him."
- Tropic Thunder.
- Shooting Tropic Thunder.
"He was like, ""You won't believe where I've been."""
"He said, ""I've been in the jungle holding my guts and carrying my intestines over my shoulders through the forest."""
"We're like, ""Yeah, right, buddy."""
"Well, now I know what he means because I've seen the film."
This was such a different role for him.
Didn't he keep saying...
"Kept being like, ""I'm not really an asshole."""
"Like, ""I'm not really like this."" He was so good at it."
He kept saying he felt really bad because he was manhandling me and being so...
It's a pretty obnoxious character.
- But he's so not anything like that.
- He did it really well.
"I felt like the fattest girl in this fake club here, because I was."
That's so stupid.
Look at how gorgeous you are.
"Well, because I was..."
My face was completely obscured in shadow just then.
"This was, like, the coldest night ever."
- This is as bad as it got.
- Poor Alexis...
- It's true.
"...who has, you know..."
"Weighs, like, 5 pounds and didn't have any clothing."
"Also, we were like on..."
- We were near the bay.
- And on the water.
- You were right on the Hudson River.
- Hudson River.
"It was, I don't know, 3 or 4 in the morning and it was probably about 5 or 10 degrees."
- This was the day...
"Photographed in Aix-en-Provence, a man I really loved."
And a Corsica landcsape.
"Just like before, the sun through the tree."
"It's not the same tree as before, but it's the same man."
"The same garage in Montfort I'Amaury, close to Ravel's house."
I went on vacation there last year.
"That's done with a light pencil, and that's entirely imagined."
I like to do that...
Didn't you cover the negative?
"No, the negative ends here."
I actually printed this...
Then I prolonged the picture...
"With imaginary lines, on the top and the bottom."
"Then in the middle, all this black part."
All with the light pencil.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
And my two friends?
"No, I don't know them..."
I'm sure you've seen them here before.
"The real version of this picture, is this one."
"""Eric's new boots"""
It's a guy who'd follow me around surprinsingly...
Without any warning...
"Without me wanting him to, in New York."
I didn't like him very much...
He'd come to New York all dressed in white...
With clothes he'd bought for the occasion...
And boots very...
Which he was proud of...
Which must've cost a great deal of money...
He photographed everything in New York.
- No.
[Grunts]
You'll never find them again.
What the hell?
[Growls]
[Breathing heavily]
He's not himself.
He's been acting weird.
"I'm just, you know, worried about him as to what he saw."
Has he said anything?
"No, but I can tell there's something not right."
Hank's got to be shook up about this in some way.
"You know, I mean whether he's talking about it or not, when I saw him looking up at me, he was freaked."
- Aah!
- [Groans]
"And it's a look I've seen before, let me tell you."
"I'm sure you're hoping it will just go away, and he won't say anything, but look."
"This is not, like, your ordinary nightmare, okay?"
He knows he was awake.
And his brain is trying to process the unprocessable.
"I mean, what did you think when you first saw one woge?"
[Snarls]
- I thought I was going crazy.
"- Right, well..."
"Hank's probably going through the same thing, you know?"
"You know, with you, it was one thing."
He was hit.
He was knocked out.
He was a little dazed.
"But I mean, he saw Brinkerhoff change."
That is so not going to make it any easier.
"Trust me, mental hospitals are chock-full of people who have spent their lives trying to wrap their minds around things they've seen and can't explain."
But what will you do?
Think it over once again Jai
Are you making a mistake?
Grave mistake
Will you go back to India and prove that Om was right and we were wrong?
I'm not going back to India
I came to this city because this is a midway place.
Not fast like Mumbai
"Nor slow, like our Satna."
"As of now, I'm working in Pizza Hut"
"But someday, I'll build myself a fast food chain"
So I got to find myself a job soon.
"Yes, I talked up a computer firm"
They order pizzas from us.
When Can I meet up?
Tonight.
"Actually, they start working from 10 in the night"
G Four
Heard lots about you
Hacking papers from Mumbai University is no mean task
We're entering a bank account.
The one who pulls off the heist... is entitled to 50 percent of the loot
The rest is ours.
G Four's
So... you are professional hackers?
What are you?
Baby hacker?
One thing for Sure
"If we're thieves, you're a thief too"
"Grandma, why have we left our home?"
Why have we come here?
It was too large a house for so few of us
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
is it good?
"Bye-bye, dickhead."
"See you in Attica, dick."
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money!
"I told you, I gotta straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead."
Then you're better off staying in here.
They could whack me in here as easy as outside.
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here.
You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.
I remember I had this feeling I was gonna get killed right outside the jail.
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me and he's such a hothead.
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me."
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"So, now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until things got straightened out."
Fuck!
"Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
How's your arm?
"(DISTORTED) You think, because you tasted my blood, that you know what I am."
"Well, to be fair, I am standing in your flat."
You don't know what I am.
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?
Everywhere!
I can walk down any street.
I can peer...
"- He's close, less than a mile."
- I can knock on any door.
I am the shape at the window.
I am the hand under the bed.
"So what's the play, Cameron?"
"Cos that's what it is, isn't it?"
It's a play.
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.
Do you know anything about this city?
"Well, I know that it smells a bit funny when it gets hot."
"This, now, everything, this place, this time, this cretinised culture."
"- We are the richest, most decadent..."
- Less than three minutes.
...people that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.
"You see, kids in Whitechapel play video games in which they score points by killing prostitutes."
(SIREN BLARES)
They're totally indifferent to the spectre that walks past their window.
(SIREN BLARES)
This is a dead city.
- It's an unreal city.
"Yeah, I know."
I forgot.
She wanted to talk about the vacation.
"She wanted to know, was it, ""Like the usual?"""
This was my daughter who called or my wife?
Your daughter.
"Okay, I'll call her back."
Yes?
All that glucose...
Yes?
Worries me.
I can examine you if you want.
I'm a doctor.
"All right... what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?"
"You work at St. Louis, right?"
I don't know if I'm the right...
"Nathan, I believe you have misunderstood me."
I'm very serious.
You mustn't take hypoglycemia lightly.
"In fact, you shouldn't take any symptom lightly... ever."
You can't imagine the number of cells you burn up every day.
"Of course, you'll tell me you're also manufacturing..."
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.
Every day a few more.
All that glucose you're pumping in is just cheap energy.
"Very bad for you, very bad for the neurons."
"Thank you for your concern about my health, but I'm fine."
Now why don't you tell me what you want from me?
"That slight shaking in your hands, have you had that a long time?"
- You're gonna take us all out for American food?
"- Close, but wrong."
We'll bring America here.
We'll have a beach party.
"Big fire, blankets, singing."
"Huge, boiling kettle full of lobsters, crabs, clams, whatever they've got."
"Hawkeye, I don't see a whole lot of lifeguards around here."
"Yeah, well you would if this was Inchon."
"And where's there sea, there's gotta be seafood, Mama."
Hah!
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that sound fantastic?
- That really sounds stupid.
- But is it possible?
- Of course.
The stupid is always possible.
- Great.
Can you leave right away?
Me?
You want me to drive halfway across Korea... on treacherous roads over hostile terrain?
"I don't want my Purple Heart to read, ""He gave his life for crabs."""
"Klinger, the future of the whole camp depends on this."
- Not to mention our lives.
- Aha!
"Your wanting me in the driver's seat certainly puts me in the driver's seat... for, say, a three-day pass?"
- Thief!
"- ""Thief"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say ""entrepreneur""?"
"Sign here, Prince."
I'll fill in the date after I decide on one.
"This is blackmail, and I won't stand for it."
- Erode.
So she has been is caught in our radar!
Her name is neither Deepa nor Ashwini.
It is Vasundhara.
Her native is Trichy.
She worked in a jewellery shop there.
She duplicated the jewels that don't sell...
And stole the original.
She was caught red-handed one day.
"From the May of 2013 to the November of 2013, she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail."
Her father is no more.
Her mother passed away when she was in prison.
Any relatives?
"One maternal uncle, Ravi."
Do you want to see who that is?
Look.
So it's a well-planned and executed ordeal.
But the mastermind behind all of this is
Vasundhara.
"I am not able to, Vikram."
You know that my parents are no more.
My brother is all I have.
Why does he have all these problems!
You could have told me in advance.
Never-ending problems...
Hospital atmosphere...
Smell of medicines...
"Amidst all of this, the happiness that I have left is when I'm away from all these."
and spend some time with you.
Do you want to me to cry that time also?
What do doctors have to say?
"Before the tumor grows further, a liver transplant has to be done."
It was a non-alcoholic reception.
"I was like, ""I hope they get diarrhea on the honeymoon."""
That's not a very nice thing to say.
"I was like, ""Really?"
"I was gonna say I hope they die tonight."""
Nothing gets me on the dance floor like a big old pint of sweet tea!
"I like to be fully present in the moment, fully aware I'm not a good dancer."
The sweet tea reminds me every step of the way.
I've used a Fleshlight before.
"Guys, don't be like that."
Don't be like that.
"I was at a show, doing a festival in Texas."
They gave all the performers a gift bag.
In the gift bag there was a free Fleshlight.
I don't know if they gave us those as a joke.
I didn't take it as one.
I pulled myself aside... and immediately reprioritized my entire afternoon.
"I said, ""Rory, we skipped lunch before."
Didn't kill us then.
"Will not kill us now."""
"""Fuck this thing!"" Out loud in a hotel lobby."
"""I gotta get my dick out!"
"I gotta do it!"""
"Some women in this crowd, you're like, ""I think it's gross he used a Fleshlight."""
Some women don't care.
"Some women still think I said ""flashlight."""
Now you know who you are.
So do the people around you.
"""Well, then what is it?"" ""I don't fucking know."
Dude fucking loves 9/11.
I don't know.
"I don't know."""
"Hello, dear."
Are you all right?
"This is a terrible, terrible time for us, Michelangelo."
"Actually, I'm really not sure that you should still be here."
Poor Dorothy.
Poor Bonnie.
Even if she was a little difficult...
Well...
"She made the people in the backroom suffer, you see, at her fittings."
"The lateness, the screaming, the insults."
"She insulted me, too, often enough."
She had to have this and she had to have that.
Whatever you did was wrong.
"Whatever you paid her, it wasn't enough."
It was a nightmare.
"Of course, it was galling to think that in one day, a so-called day, she earned more than some workers earn in six months or even a year."
"It doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"Well, but then there she was the next day on the front pages."
"You know, dear, my father, he started this business from nothing."
My mother worked all hours.
They both did.
And I was their only child.
I wanted to go to law school.
I wanted to be a politician.
I wanted to change the world.
But how could I let them down?
I couldn't do that.
And now it all seems irrelevant.
Bonnie's family are flying in.
The whole thing is unbearable.
I can't even bear to talk about it.
Not even to you.
"Oh, yeah."
Lightning's ready
Ka-chow!
Get your antenna balls here!
"Go, Lightnin'!"
- Whoo!
"- You got that right, slick."
Uh!
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
"I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip."
We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.
"Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof."
"If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!"
"Right, Darrell."
"Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season."
And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.
"Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?"
He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
"And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks."
He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Chick thought this was his year.
His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!
"You know, I don't think anybody expected this."
The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.
But everyone knows him now.
Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
"The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!"
"Three cars, one champion!"
No you don't.
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
(laughing)
katherine:
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
-You're gonna be late.
-lt's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
-l don't.
I don't want to be up all goddamn night.
- It's decaf.
- Better be.
"Nobody has a secret plan to caffeinate you, Cash."
- I do.
- Forget it.
I can't trust none of yous.
"Hey, mousse, how you doing?"
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm okay."
"Listen, mousse, you know, I don't go in for much emotion."
"I just wanted to say, for what it's worth, that your dad is a good man."
"You know, he served his community, saved a lot of people..."
Yeah.
"And you turned out all right, didn't you?"
"You know, I think if this is his time, he can walk toward the light with his head held up high."
"Small comfort, I know, but..."
"Thanks, Cash."
I appreciate it.
"But I got to tell you, I never really got that ""walk towards the light"" business."
Many people who have had near-death experiences have reported seeing...
I know what they say.
I'm just saying I don't get it.
"Folks find the idea comforting, John."
- I know I do.
- I don't.
"Maybe I'm a distrustful bastard, but how do we know what's beyond that light?"
"Okay, John."
Maybe that light's leading somewhere you don't want to go.
How do you know it's not hell?
"The light for hell would be red, obviously."
"Would it, Stats?"
He's gonna abandon that car.
We'll find it.
It'll tell us where he's going.
Watch this.
Keep your eyes on the guard.
Look at his holster.
The safety strap's unfastened.
Wait a minute.
"What the hell is he doing with a gun, anyway?"
"Weapons are for towers, gates and transports only."
- Maybe it was a rookie mistake.
"- No, not a rookie mistake."
He's in on it.
He wanted Dawkins to have that gun.
What's in it for the guard?
"Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets."
Hey.
"Billy Omana, right?"
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, put those on."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, if you answer incorrectly one more time, we're gonna put those scrubs on you, drop you in the general population."
- How long you think you'll last there?
"- Heh, you can't do that."
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
My name is Brent Sodor.
I used to be on Schmidt's security team.
You work for Schmidt?
!
Do I look like I'm still on the payroll?
!
I was being tortured!
Please.
"Y-you're trying to find him, right?"
Right?
Am I right?
"Well, I can help you."
I'll tell you anything you want.
Just don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Untie him.
We're taking him to Jabbar.
He lives for now.
"Most intelligence agencies lack the resources to set up safe houses all over the world, which is why they depend on expat civilians to lend their homes or businesses for missions abroad."
"If you're a former Syrian intelligence officer, the local Syrian restaurant can make a handy base of operations -- and save you a few bucks on lunch."
"Welcome, my friend."
Please -- please sit.
You know who I am?
I have an idea.
You're the guy that's...
trying to kill Schmidt.
Yeah.
My name is Jabbar Hamady.
Mr. Schmidt has taken something that belongs to me.
"So, my men told me a very interesting story about finding you in the warehouse."
Tell me about this.
"Yeah, my name's Brent Sodor, and, like I told your men, I'm on Schmidt's security team."
Air flow in the stomach!
Energy flow from the abdomen
"Brother Jin, what is that?"
This is the art of utilizing the vital energy
It can loosen stiff joints and helps blood flow
"If you follow the instruction, not only horse stance"
But you can stand up to any stance!
Air flow in the stomach!
Energy flow from the abdomen
Eyes closed as the energy gathers!
Left and right and left and right!
A thousand pounds and I'm still alright!
Left and right and left and right!
A thousand pound and I'm still alright!
Looks like he gives a damn
Get into position!
Make a proper horse stance!
Or get stomach stance
Do it!
Higher!
Oh!
"3rd brother, what are you doing?"
You asshole!
"3rd Brother, Jian is already serving his punishment"
Why do you beat him up?
He...oh my foot!
Poor foot!
What?
Brother Jin
Would you be leaving this place tomorrow?
"Y es, during the past three months..."
I've already taught you all that I knew
I don't understand.
"No, no, no."
Please!
"Please, I'll be quiet."
I don't want to go in there!
I promise I'll be quiet.
"No, don't!"
"No, don't!"
"Please, I'll be quiet."
Please!
I want to go home!
Please!
"I wonder what the unsub meant by ""eleven."""
We know he measures the time spent in each house.
It could be some sort of countdown.
"What are you thinking, Aaron?"
The hospital report on Ellie Zumwalt.
Her injuries were minor.
It was the gradual loss of blood that caused her to lose consciousness.
"Well, the unsub must have thought she bled out and left her for dead."
That was his big mistake.
I don't think there was a mistake.
What do you mean?
"What if Ellie Zumwalt was never meant to die, that the mistake that the unsub made was actually at the first crime scene?"
The Brewer murders?
The guy's a family annihilator.
He killed them all.
To me that sounds like mission accomplished.
We didn't understand why he used two different murder weapons on Jim and Lyla Brewer.
That's because there never was a second weapon.
I'm still not following.
"Dave, you said that a large piece of furniture was moved to block the top of the stairs at the Brewer house."
"- No, I didn't."
"- Yes, you did."
"Shit, did I really?"
That's so weird.
I don't understand why people wanna get married.
[SIGHS]
They don't.
- They don't?
- No.
"No, no guy actually wants to get married."
"And if they do, all they're really thinking about?"
All the women they're gonna miss out on.
"I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth."
"I don't know, man, I..."
Why'd you get married?
I love Janine.
You're a happily married guy.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'd say so."
"Now, I know I don't need to tell any of you that my cousin Paige is hot."
[ALL LAUGHING]
"In high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked because no one wanted to blow their chances with her."
[ALL LAUGHING]
And when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
MAN:
"Hear, hear."
WOMAN:
That's sweet.
"But, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market."
"Yeah, sure, she may be an older model but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank."
But don't stay on the lot too long or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all...
"Okay, that's enough of the speeches."
The refinery is a bit further down there.
"- Come on, let's get away from here!"
- Come on!
Go back or the whole depot will blow up!
The train has to get away from here.
Go back!
"First, we have to get out of here."
- We must get away as fast as possible.
- Yes.
"Out of the way, damn it!"
We must get away from the fuel depot as quickly as possible.
Hurry!
See if you can find something to force it open.
We can get out through there.
"It's really incredible that you got out, Padre."
"Come on, let's go."
Almost a miracle.
"Come on, hurry up, everybody!"
Gómez has the situation in the north under control.
This time the bastard won't slip through our fingers.
This time I'll get him.
"This is where he was last seen, and this is where we will wait for him."
Are you listening?
What's the matter?
Carrasco's trapped.
He doesn't stand a chance now.
He made a mistake.
He is forced to cross the Cañonda Sierra.
He's finished.
"Luck will be with you, as long as I'm with you."
I shall leave no stone unturned to try and keep you in power.
Everything's quiet here.
You have a lieutenant here.
"Lieutenant, uh, James Dunbar."
"Yes, sir."
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
105353.
That is correct.
"Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations."
"Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men."
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt.
They are very angry in Berlin.
They will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train.
"Don't you think so, lieutenant?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Now, lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters?"
I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here.
Why bother?
No bother.
I'm very grateful for a little company.
"You see, I suffer from insomnia."
Did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?
"We have some rights, colonel."
Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
You will not get them.
How did he ever find out about that train?
You must have shot your mouths off from Frankfurt to here.
"- No, we didn't."
-Maybe just a hint or so?
Think hard.
You should be starting at the bottom.
"BOYD OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CENTER 155 LAFAYETTE STREET WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16"
I'm number 37.
I've been waiting for five years.
But the sicker ones keep moving up the list past me.
"You having any problems, Carmen?"
Not yet.
But I'd like to get off this thing and have a life.
"In Peru, you can get a kidney in 48 hours."
People line up around the block to sell them.
Surprised you're not on a plane right now.
I would be.
If I had 100 grand to pay for transplant.
"Here, I'll probably die waiting."
"I've been waiting seven years, and I'm sick of nurses and doctors and hospitals and praying."
Man of your means has other options.
Buy a kidney?
No.
I've had a good life.
No regrets.
I'd rather leave the money to my grandchildren.
But you'd know where to go if you changed your mind.
Everybody does.
We used to talk about it all the time in my dialysis group.
Can you give us a name?
"I could, but it would only be a rumor."
And I don't necessarily believe it's wrong.
Then why didn't you do it?
Because we spent 90 grand on our wedding.
There's nothing left.
Now she's gonna die because I can't even afford to save her life.
Staying positive is better for Kyle.
I will die for this.
The queen will kill me herself.
What a show.
She's going out in style.
must I do everything?
"Shall I catch my head in my own hands, too?"
When can we talk about my tomb?
A florentine sculptor?
20 tons of marble?
I can't afford it.
"After the 100 musicians,"
The dozen ships made of silver and gold...
Symbolic of my journey
To heaven.
I'm not asking for a fleet.
You're not headed for heaven either.
You're dragging this out.
You have to wait for final word
On bash's legitimization anyway.
Why kill me if the line of succession reverts to my sons?
You're a treasonous adulterer.
Then I'll continue with the seating chart.
"Mary, the feast will be held there."
Choose your place of honor.
You are going to die.
What they write about your execution won't matter.
It will to my children.
50 musicians.
I'll reduce the gold inlay on my tomb.
What is that?
There's a royal visitor.
French court has gone to hell.
"She's got you on the hop already, mate."
Sit down.
"Look, I..."
I know he's young.
(Bangs around in the kitchen)
"But there's something so special, beautiful."
"I-I tried to resist him, believe me."
I-I tried but...
What we have now is extremely honest and good.
You sure I can't tempt you with a burger?
"Uh, no."
"Come on, we've got marty sauce."
No?
I want to find a way to make this work.
I want to protect him emotionally and care for his academic future.
"Sorry, did you say protect him?"
Yes.
You're delusional.
You think I'm delusional?
"From what Finnegan tells me about you, it sounds like you..."
"Oh, listen Fiona, I know I'm a sinner, alright?"
"I know, because despite the enormity of what you're doing with my beautiful boy,"
I would fuck you in a heartbeat if he wasn't coming back in a minute.
Do you really want to turn him into me?
"The best thing you can do for Fuzz right now, believe me, is go downstairs, get in your car, and get driving and keep driving, preferably until you find some sort of elevated landform, and then keep driving a little bit more, OK?"
"Let's go, Fi."
"Fuck, Dad."
Fuzz.

"Lose the judge-face, Zoe."
He took a very heavy course load this semester.
"Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer."
I can work with that.
We hear Blair Waldorf's headed for a comeback.
But if she wants to keep her fans happy...
Send.
She better keep serving up the hits.
Sleep well?
"Don't even, Serena."
"I can't believe you posted on ""Gossip Girl"""
That I'm a drug dealer.
I didn't post anything.
Fine.
"Maybe you didn't send the actual e-mail,"
But everyone knows you have Blair do your dirty work.
I can't help what Blair does.
And you are the one who played Pablo Escobar

My dad and I were finally in a good place
"After a really, really bad patch."
"And if he finds this out, it'll destroy everything."
"Well, maybe Rufus should know"
That his daughter is dealing drugs.
"After all, you thought my father should know"
All my adventures at boarding school.
Fine.
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything,"
But maybe you shouldn't be lying to your dad.
Are you really lecturing me about lying to a parent?
"My dad knows who I am,"
But you're building a relationship with yours
You must've really won her over.
She does not dig up those stories for just anyone.

"Well, loosely speaking, of course."
Yeah.

"Tell me, were you ever born in a big white house surrounded by a high green hedge?"
"With an orchard, a patch of woods and a natural spring."
- 'Yes.'
- No.
What?
No big house with little thatches growing all around it?
There's nothing like going out in the morning and picking yourself a nice fresh bunch of thatches.
"Boy, am I glad I got rid of that house."
"And now, you haven't a care in the world."
No.
Let us hit them again.
Let us reform and hit them again.
I know we can do it.
"God bless you, gentlemen."
"They're forming over there, Major."
I do fear they may attack.
"Yes, sir."
General Pickett.
You may reform to the rear of this ridge and set up a defensive position.
"General Pickett, sir."
You must look to your division.
General Lee.
I have no division.
General...
We will withdraw as soon as we have secured all those wounded or who are well enough to be moved.
If we can reach the Potomac and cross over into Virginia there will be no more immediate danger.
"But I'll need your help, Pete."
I'm so very tired.
"What can I do, sir?"
General?
We must look to our own deportment.
The spirit of the army is still very good.
Very good indeed.
We will do better another time.
They do not die for us.
Not for us.
That at least is a blessing.
If this war goes on...
And it will.
It will.

"Everything's wrong, jim."
Everything.
"Well, what is it?"
Tell me.
"Well, I- i've never tried to talk to you before about business, but- that's because you're nervous about me, like luke is."
"It's not that, jim."
It's what you're doing.
It isn't right.
You're only thinking of yourself.
I spent a fucking fortune on mine.
Did you?
I mean...
Have you been married once?
Twice.
Was that on the first one?
"No, I spent nothing on the first one."
I'm so relieved.
And I actually hope she's watching.
It should have been Vegas.
It would be actually easier to kill them.
Than get a divorce?
I like you.
I'm just saying that.
I'm not advocating killing anyone.
Sure you're not!
"I'm not saying that, but when you've been on the phone to British Gas for six hours,"
"""Just take his name off the fucking gas bill!"""
You just go...
"""I fucking killed him."
"I fucking shot him."""
That's what you want to say.
Do you know what I mean?
Can you tell us about your Top 30 hit?
"About seven years ago, I decided I wanted to try and have a hit in Ireland, but you don't want to be..."
"You don't have a Top 10 hit, because people will remember, cos I do music as part of my comedy."
"It might be one of the things like the Chicken Song, where people shout it at you for years to come."
For the rest of your life.
Yeah.
So I decided number 27 would be the correct number to aim for and February is the month where no-one buys singles.
"It used to be the month, anyway."
This is pre-downloads.
"When I'm sad, they're here for me."
"Oh, my God!"
They're just genuine guys.
We love them because they sing our feelings.
They say what we want to hear...
"-...and no boys, no one, says to us."
-Yes.
They can't be real.
They make us believe that everything is possible if we believe in ourselves.
I know they love me.
Even they don't know me.
I know.
They have changed my Iife.
"It may sound cheesy, but they have."
"We love you, One Direction!"
I'm right in front row!
You sing!
"Here we go, O2!"
think our fans are dedication at its best.
hat they've done for us  in three years is just....
It's unheard of.
here was this group  of what called superfans.
And they were like promoters.
"Go on, spread the word!"
So start tweeting and I literally made it my Iife.
"I've sent like 1 6,000 tweets."
I was tweeting from Japan.
"hat was quite mad  watching our witter just gradually, Iike, keep totting up."
"hese girls are crazy about One Direction, and I've got no idea why."
I'm not a neuroscientist.
As soon as Directioners listen to music and find the music pleasurable what happens in the brain is that a neurochemical called dopamine is released and provides feelings of joy and happiness.
Shivers.
Do you know how many married men hit on me in a week?
No tell us.
I don't really know the exact number but it's figgin high.
At least this is what I tell myself.
Come on guys let's go.
All I know for certain is that dating in this city sucks and I'm dying.
Thank you.
"I'm serious, I'm done."
You guys don't hate me but I might pass on going out tonight.
What?
"No, no you are going."
You just got out of a crappy relationship and you are single.
Plus you our designated driver.
Thanks a lot for the guilt.
Going out in LA isn't quite like it is in any other city.
Because of the whole who's who factor... that this place evolves around.
So unless you're an A List B List or C List celebrity... work in the A List... arena or you're a friend of the club Jonathan slash door Nazi then... yeah it's pretty much impossible to get in.
Bottom line there are three major questions in Hollywood.
Who are you?
What do you do?
And who are your friends?
If you are not on the list leave.
"Oh, honey not in my club."
Natural hair colors only.
Anthony!
"Oh, hi."
Of course come on in.
"Great, Jonathan's working the door."
"Sorry, ladies, we're full."
Seven really?
You want in my club?
I texted you three times last three three times!
"The dead are being dug from the rubble and in France, the German armies wait for this country to surrender."
But English troops are fighting back.
"In the skies, the young men of the RAF are struggling against the Nazi forces which only a year ago invaded Poland, swept through France, and left this country standing alone in a conflict which, if lost,"
could destroy the Free World.
"Sergeant Major, move the men in."
"All right, you lot, move."
Mind your backs.
Gangway.
I found the four extra carriages you need.
- Good.
- You'll have your thousand men.
- I'd rather be with them than here.
"- Finland appeals to you, does it?"
- Is it the country or the ladies?
- Just a brief surge of patriotism.
- Are you coming for a drink?
"- Thanks, no."
Perhaps tomorrow.
Hello?
- See you in the morning.
- Yes.
Three that I can see from here.
Cheers.
- Mr Faber?
"- Hello, Billy."
I've got another interview with the army.
You don't look any older than you did last week.
My mate Harry's got some cream that'll take the pimples off just like that.
There's no need to rush.
"There'll be plenty of war left, I can promise you."
But I want to fight now.
Everyone's in uniform except me.
But you stuttered yesterday and the day before.
It was on one word.
It was on one stupid little word.
And you know what the word was?
Country.
Country.
And you know why I probably hit that word?
"It was because I was in the presence of Callie, who's a card-carrying c-c-cunt."
[chuckle]
Good for you.
You no longer have a speaking part in the trial.
"Okay, first of all, if I were to stutter in court, which I won't, but if I were, that would only serve to humanize me in front of the jury, which could run to the benefit"
of our very inhuman- and monstrous-seeming client.
"You put me on this case because I'm smart and I'm talented, and I have done great work, thanks to you."
"I've done it-- behind the scenes, maybe, but I-"
- I deserve to be seen doing it.
Shaken confidence does not serve the client or the firm.
My confidence is not shaken.
Mine is.
Come on.
I'm ready for this.
Let me do it.
Please.
You'll still be a valuable member of the team.
And a dear friend.
Are you breaking up with me?
[click]
- Good night.
- Good night.
Callie.
I hear you're back on top with Borns Tech.
Not surprising.
I know I never told you often enough.
You were the best goddamn center fielder in high school.
"And on ice, heh heh, tough as nails."
Not to mention the way you fight fire.
You put every other fireman I ever knew to absolute goddamn shame.
I should have said this shit when I was alive.
"But hell, I'm saying it now."
You are the best goddamn son a father could ever hope for.
You happy now?
- Yeah.
"- Well, get over it."
"Because if you believe all that, I got some land down in florida I might want to sell you."
Now give me a goddamn drink.
"Middletons, not that bottom shelf shit."
He was a pretty good center fielder.
"No bat, hell of a glove."
I'll take the bottom shelf shit.
- Jameson'S.
- What is that with you?
"Budweiser, jameson's, always the low-rent shit."
"Hey, you know what, I like the way it tastes."
I could give a shit about what people think.
He's a great fireman.
No bustin' balls.
He's too risky.
Gets the job done.
"You know how many people would be dead but for him breaking rules, taking chances?"
Lot of kids would be on this side of the bar.
"Most guys, they play it safe."
"Him, he pushes the envelope."
"Like, um, what's his name?"
Who's that quarterback?
I protected you from clear and massive violations of Federal rules and regulations!
You know what?
"Whatever you did, you got paid for it, didn't you?"
- [click]
- We made mistakes.
Okay?
But I'll tell you what we didn't do.
We didn't kill anyone.
"How about you, Donald?"
Did you kill anyone?
No.
- Don't tell me--
- Hey.
- You fucking asshole.
- Wendell.
You know what?
What was his name?
"But, with her consent, Captain Dreyfuss, so if you don't mind, I won't give you his name."
"I don't believe he meant any harm, and my daughter said he was sweet and chivalrous."
I don't want him punished any more than he has been.
Has been?
"Er, Michael was very upset."
He let the young man know forcefully.
- Forcefully?
Were there blows?
- Almost.
"No father finds it easy to cope with the idea that his daughter is the object of, er, let's say, desire, Captain Dreyfuss."
Do you have children of your own?
No.
"I am, er, I'm not married."
I should go.
"Our notes on Moybeg can wait until another time, given how you must feel right now."
He must die in jealous.
And I must watch it.
What if our parents know it.
"I'll not tell, you too don't tell anyone."
I'll play with his life taking him to home.
"This bracelet was made in India, buyer's details are taken before selling it to them."
First find the jewellary shop.
"If you give this bracelet number, they will give the buyer's details."
"Kinsman, our children have agreed to marry, I'm very happy."
"Yes, I never felt so happy even when I made billions."
That's why I'm throwing this party.
"You said your son-in-law lives in Malaysia, where's he?"
They are also beautiful!
"Didn't I say, I'm Jiguru Jingania?"
"I didn't tell my name, right?"
'Run' Prakash Raj.
"Dear, didn't your short man come with you?"
What's this dad?
"All can't be tall like you, look down, dad."
"Have you come, son-in-law?"
"Why did you come so late, brother-in-law?"
What's this new get up?
That is...
"Kinsman, my son-in-law."
Nobody knows when I'll come.
Do you know why you're here?
Just a joke.
"Jokes apart, why did you change your name?"
That is...
"It seems you're here for a year, and refusing to go to India."
What's the matter?
I made an attempt to murder.
Put her on the God damned damn phone right now!
She's not here.
What!
?
"Look, I might as well tell you, she's with Alex now."
Alex?
"She's with him tonight, he and Claire split-up."
I'm sure you know how much she's always cared for him.
"So, like I said, I see no point in your pursuing this any further."
I'm so sorry to have keep you waiting.
"So, Mr. Jenkins, which one do you like best?"
"To be perfectly honest, I think you're more beautiful now."
Good answer.
Wai... wai... wai... wai...
"wait a minute, wait a minute."
What?
What?
What's the matter?
"What did you mean by, ""You must have loved me all along but just didn't know it.""?"
I don't...
"Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait..."
"figure it out, 'cause I'd like an answer."
"Well, I don't know, Rose, I mean, you were different then, you weren't the same as you are now."
"So, how could you have LOVED me then?"
"Well, I loved you because of who you were, not because I wanted who you are."
So now you want who I am because I'm not who I was anymore?
Okay...
"Rose, what?"
Where are you going?
"You know something, I have dreamt about this moment from the first day we met."
"I've played it out a million times in my mind... how you'd look, what you'd say, what you'd think."
- And guess what?
"You, a fugitive from a sanatorium, calling me names?"
"Well, you're not Mrs. Steven Carrington anymore."
And you no longer have the right to drop by for any of your little visits here.
"I happen to be Mrs. Adam Carrington, and I will come and go as I please."
"Don't try and give yourself Carrington airs, lady."
A wedding band on your finger doesn't mean anything around here.
You're still a nobody.
"Oh, that is wonderful coming from you."
Who came from nowhere and married Steven for his money.
And then was willing to sell her own son.
At least I loved him.
"You're wrong, Claudia."
I'm the winner here.
And I always have been.
I'm a rich woman with my own power.
And I don't have to live off other people's handouts.
Poor Claudia.
That's all you've ever been around here.
"In case you didn't know it then, you know now."
The painting on the staircase was just the beginning.
I hear the paintings in the west gallery alone are worth millions.
"Modiglianis, Riveras, Monets, Manets."
"Princess, don't you see?"
We're sitting on a gold mine.
It's more like a mine field.
We've got to be patient.
There's a whole lot more for us than Sammy Jo's inheritance.
Patient.
Are you crazy?
I can't keep coming up with headaches.
What am I supposed to do?
Sleep with him.
Yeah.
Clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.
There were eight.
W-What are you talking about?
I discovered a fourth New York victim...
A man by the name of Pat Crews.
Are you sure?
Phillip Harris only knew about three.
There's a reason he missed this one.
Because this murder took place on the same day The Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.
But how can that be?
Unless...
"There are two serial killers, one on each coast."
[Knock on door]
- [Groans] Who is that?
- Castle:
I don't know.
"Whoever it is, I hope they brought coffee."
Detective Menendez.
- You know...
- Please come in.
"I expect to be screwed over by an asshat that I don't know, but not from one who's supposed to be my friend."
I take it that you heard about what happened at Austin Elektra's house last night.
You said you'd keep me in the loop.
"Look, we can explain."
"Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon."
And our lab tested it this morning...
it's clean.
Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?
Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse.
"They came up clean, too."
And according to the prop master...
MONTENEGRO:
"Not enough to escape, but enough to give him some range of movement."
"If he pushed himself back onto the table, he could raise his upper torso, which made it possible for him to generate a whiplike motion."
And sever his spinal cord.
I don't know.
The man was once a priest.
And suicide is a cardinal sin.
It wasn't a suicide.
"Booth, the facts clearly indicate that it was."
"A sacrifice, it was a sacrifice."
"""Sacrifice""?"
He was trying to protect someone.

AUBREY:
"Look, so, um, sorry that I haven't been exactly present."
JESSICA:
"Oh, well, we've all been working hard."
"I haven't been that available, either. (chuckles)"
"No, I'm talking mentally present."
I've been distracted.
"Oh, yeah, it's-- it's about your father."
"No, I-I understand."
You must be worried about what happens when they find him.
I am.
It's not as cut and dry as I thought it was gonna be.
"Well, I'm glad you're seeing that now."
"(exhales forcefully) Look, there's something else that I've been thinking about."
I want you to know that...
"I don't know, I've had feelings for Jamie for quite a long time."
Really?
Yeah.
Romantic feelings?
"Yeah, all my sexual fantasies about Jamie Oliver don't really actually contain sex."
What do they contain?
"Well, it's really, it's sort of..."
"He's in the kitchen, he's cooked me a roast chicken."
"And then he, like, draws me a bath."
"And then I, when I come out of the bath, I come back into the kitchen, and he's just, like, washed up and tidied everything away."
"Oh, stop it!"
And that's it.
Did you say sexual fantasy?
"Yeah, but that's the thing about being with Jamie, there's no pressure to put out."
Yeah.
That's what I like about him.
"I mean, in this fantasy, though, is the bath really hot?"
"And then you look down, and there's carrots in it as well?"
"You'd want to worry about, like, if I was his wife, I'd feel really sad."
Jules?
"Yeah, Jules, Jules."
"Because, like, he'd come home and go..."
She don't like her.
Yeah.
"Um, if I was his current first wife... ..Jules, and he was telling me, ""Oh, you look gorgeous."""
"""I just saw you on the BBC calling a trout gorgeous!"
"""How am I supposed to feel?"""
"He's got so many kids, in't he?"
"It's like Daisy Boo, Poppy, Honey, River Rocket, he's running out of names!"
"Next one he'll be like,"
"""What should we call this, Spaghetti Pete?"
"I don't know."""
"So you're telling me that you want me to go flirt with Trent, rub up against his body... take my hands and stroke them down his five, six, seven, eight abs."
- No.
- I'm not finished yet!
And then I'm going to grope his perfect ass.
I'm going to make out with him.
him and steal his diamond back with my tongue.
"Look, I'll do it."
I won't like it... but I'm gonna love it!
"For real, I'm tired of pretending that we're not together."
"Listen, I know you said that we only went on one date together but we've been on a lot of dates together."
We spent the night at a bed and breakfast in Lake
"Michigan and no, I didn't tell any of our friends about it because you promised me not to but I guess they knew why anyway."
Know why that is?
Because you actually did tell them?
Yeah.
He took pictures of you sleeping.
"Completely shaved, huh?"
I liked it.
You know what?
I'm not apologizing for it.
I'm glad that us is a thing because honestly
I've been waiting for us to happen for like three years now.
And if you're embarrassed to be with me that's fine.
I could deal with that.
Uh...
wait.
Were you gonna kiss...
OK.
OK.
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"So we're good, yeah?"
- I'm in.
He never told me that.
You see?
"You never know, do you?"
"On the other hand,"
Ward Fowler has an alibi.
He was with Mark during the whole time during the murder.
And that alibi is ain'tight.
Is it as ain'tight as Sid Daley's?
"Oh, I think it's more, sir."
"I mean, a girl that you're gonna marry is much more apt to provide an alibi than a gofer."
What do we conclude from this interrogation?
"Ward Fowler denies having a motive, he won't admit to having means,"
and he can prove that he didn't have opportunity.
So that leaves us with Sid Daley.
"That's a great third act line, isn't it?"
"""That leaves us with Sid Daley."""
"Well, I think this has been very helpful, sir."
Thank you very much.
I certainly appreciate it.
Oh.
"One more thing, sir."
We got something else on the gun.
Did I mention that?
"No, you."
Didn't.
"What, Lieutenant?"
A thread sir.
From the parka?
"No, sir."
"We haven't traced the garment from which the thread came from yet, sir."
"Lieutenant, if I were you, I'd get a search warrant for all four people involved."
"Yes, sir."
They kidnapped Amanda because they wanted something from him.
"And when he didn't give it, they killed her."
And he never told anyone.
You think the senator's going to make the same mistake?
"No, I'm not going to let him."
But he's holding back and I want to know why.
I hear you're having a lousy day.
Now is not the time.
"Before you get the wrong idea, I liked McNeal."
He was the first politician I covered and the last one who came out clean.
That's good.
Maybe you should put it in his obit.
Maybe I will... if you tell me why you were with him when he killed himself.
That's a good question;
"you come up with an answer, why don't you give me a call."
"Speaking of calls, do you care to comment on this one?"
"Mom, it's Sara;"
I need to talk to you.
About Jeffrey.
"It's important, so call me as soon as you can."
Where'd you get that?
We both met with Sara's parents.
I guess they liked me better.
They'll get over it.
"The Senator and Sara-- the marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought, was it?"
Off the record.
On the record.
No one's is.
"Ice machine's ready, Cap."
How 'bout you?
"Last beers, boys."
You're dating nothing but swordfish for the next three weeks.
It won't happen again.
- Thank you.
- Did I fail?
- No.
- I-I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell them...
- Most patients come to Rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh... day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more..."
advanced challenges.
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, Miss Porter."
Shall we?
- Of course.
"- And if you decide you don't like it,"
I'll come right back.
- Okay.
- Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"- Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
- I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
- Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"- Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"- Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.
- Thank you.
- She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?
Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for foreman.
I'm here to save myself.
"Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim."
That's why you're wearing the suit.
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
Give me the bag.
Mildewed dish towel.
- To retest for staph.
"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings.
Could carry toxocara.
Explain the blindness.
"Now, that I recognize as oven crud."
Could be meat with trichinella.
Would explain the high fever.
What's with rye bread?
"Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures."
There are three loaves.
- So?
You're going back in there.
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
That's looking too far into the future.
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here."
I don't see any birds.
Whistle or something.
All you think of is that dress!
What does she need it for?
Just so she can appear in it?
So she looks pretty.
What's wrong with that?
"Pretty, and for whom?"
She definitely wants to impress someone!
They want to impress each other.
Do you think we only dress up to attract some boy...
During that dance I felt she's longing to dance like that with a boy in a pretty dress.
So what?
She's eighteen.
"is she ready for it psychologically, or only biologically?"
Why do you ask me what I think about it?
"Of course, I'm interested, aren't I?"
Why do you analyse it like that?
Buy her material for that dress!
What do you keep worrying about?
You keep changing the subject.
"When you're meant to buy a dress, you begin philosophising."
"- Excuse me, where does the architect live?"
"- Sorry, who?"
I'm looking for the architect.
- Which one?
There are several here.
- Mr Ravinger.
There are as many Ravingers here as there are Anabaptists
"We're five families living here, you know."
"They have a boy in the ninth form, Marcel."
Then that's mine.
What a coincidence.
Do you know something about Marcel?
"Right, yeah."
That's not an option.
"So maybe get fired and buy a puppy, then."
Really working for me.
"Which style of cuisine would your master most favour today, sir?"
He's still keen on the seafood but he's after something...soft.
"Soft, sir?"
"He's a busy man, he don't want to waste time chewing."
I understand completely.
I would suggest caviar.
"Caviar, what?"
They're fish eggs.
Soft as silk but terrifically tasty.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
"Now that, my friend, is scrummy."
Hello again.
"Just to say, despite what I said earlier, we sadly had a burglary this afternoon, so now have to make a few cutbacks."
Fixing the toilets will have to wait.
Typical!
It is typical.
It's typical of one or two antisocial grain thieves who ruin it for everyone.
It's your fault for moving Big Paulus up here to play their stupid jug game.
Shut up.
It's a great game.
"Either way, we also can't afford new chairs."
"Oh, classic!"
You say you're one of us but you're just another lying exec looking after your mates.
"I, for one, won't stand for it."
"I'm quitting you and this, and, you know, all of this."
"Olive, you don't have to quit."
Calm down.
You want a drink?
"Lily, hand me your purse."
I'm not thirsty.
"I'm tendering my resignation and resigning my tenders to the cold, harsh reality of what's not meant to be."
But you can't just leave.
"Vivian, go wait outside."
- But...
- Haven't you caused enough trouble?
This is your home.
Where will you go?
I know a place.
Aunt Vivian used to always say there's nothing sadder than an empty birdcage.
Is Olive ever gonna come home?
She didn't say.
"She said her apartment was paid to the end of the year, and she asked me to water her plants."
I feel like I broke her.
I enlisted her to spy on my aunts and then turned her into a homeopathic drug mule.
What homeopathic drugs was she muling?
I baked antidepressants into pies to get them out of the house.
"It's something I've always wanted to do, but never had the chance."
I guess it worked.
I got them out of the house.
Olive got them out of the house.
They got out of the house.
"I mean, Vivian took the bus."
She never takes the bus.
She thinks it's too intimate.
I wish there was a way I could thank Olive.
You know today's my first day at Betty's Bees?
"Hello, Damon."
Ever hear of knocking?
An invitation wasn't necessary.
I'm surprised that no living person resides here.
Is it just you and your brother?
"Yeah, how do you keep out unwelcome vampires?"
Kill them.
Damn.
"Have a seat, Damon."
I was hoping we could have a word.
Sure.
Freak.
We've taken up residence at a farmhouse outside of town.
It'll suffice for now.
- All 25 vampires?
"- Not all, some."
I imagine that a few have already left town.
"Others are probably still in the woods, or like us, acclimating."
- How'd they get out of the tomb?
- I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus-pocus.
- Oh.
I understand that the founding families still have a secret council?
- And you're a part of it.
- Pft.
That's ridiculous.
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet.
I'm up to speed.
And so am I.
"Now that you've infiltrated the council, I need to know everything starting with a list of the members and their families."
Everyone you've supplied with vervain.
"Yes, that will have to stop immediately."
What exactly are you trying to achieve?
They did it by mail.
- Mail?
-That's right.
"Little love notes between our security officer and von Scherbach with Schulz, the mailman."
Here's the flag.
They used to put a loop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?
And here's the mailboxes.
Hollow black queens.
"Cute, huh?"
"They delivered the mail or picked it up when we were out of the barracks, like for appell."
"And when there was a special delivery they'd pull a phony air raid to get us out like last night, for instance."
There wasn't a plane in the sky.
"Or was there, Price?"
"Brother, were we all wet about you."
Forget it.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you know?
Because I got my own ideas.
Let's have that civilian stuff.
"I'll look pretty stupid in this, yodeling my way across the alps."
"Now, let's have the wire cutters."
- You taking Dunbar?
-You betcha.
There ought to be some reward money from mama.
"Say about 10,000 bucks worth."
"I told you boys, I'm no escape artist."
"For the first time, I like the odds, because now I got me a decoy."
- What's the decoy?
-Price.
When I go I want you to give me five minutes.
Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank.
Light Yagami.
The Gods of death do not take souls.
Contrary to what humans say.
Once the notebook falls into the human world.
It belongs to the world of humans.
"In other words, it's yours."
I do not want!
"Well, well."
"Still, you should not forward saying relative and all."
You should show the hierarchy respect.
"Whatever is the idea you get, say first to me."
I will forward that after filtering.
It is a risk to you once we take a reverse.
"Even if it is a risk, I should get all the credit."
Promise on Lord Hanuman.
- You locked me so.
Okay boss!
"What is this boss, like calling the adjacent guy in a bar."
"If I call dude to boss instead of boss, it is an insult to you only."
"I see, then boss is fixed."
What is this file in hands like Panchangam in the hands of a priest?
Oh god!
Never finger this file.
This is purely personal.
Sorry Boss
Very good Karthik
- Thank you sir
You have successfully joined into his chamber.
What is your next move?
"To make the next move, I need a dummy fool from your department sir."
What?
- Yes.
How do you know that?
She spoke of them.
Of their games.
A song they'd sing to calm her to sleep.
"Sometimes, I'd hear her sing it softly, to herself."
How lonely.
And haunting.
Yes.
I'm going to tell you something that might enrage you.
"Since mary's arrival, I've had visions of francis's death."
Violent images.
"They vary, but they were always tied to mary."
But they stopped completely when clarissa died.
"I have beckoned them, every way I know how,"
Because I had to be sure.
Sure of what?
That francis might live with mary.
How can that be possible?
"I warned you that francis, your firstborn,"
Would die because of mary...
You were very clear.
...Before either of us knew clarissa was your firstborn.
"The blood that has been spilled,"
"My blood yet,"
Was because of what you foresaw.
"It's not a science, it's a gift."
"Sometimes I hear voices, other times it's a feeling,"
A certainty as solid as stone.
And this new feeling?
It came to me today.
"I saw their life together, and it is happy."
"After dinner, and your usual game of catch with anne,"
"Your Honor, we call ready for trial."
[ click]
"Well, isn't this interesting?"
Call down the voir dire panel.
We're gonna pick us a jury.
What I don't understand is how you don't warn me.
"Well, you haven't been listening to me."
I wasn't sure I was going to do it when we went in.
I had to see if they were ready.
We're not ready!
- We're not ready.
"- They're not, either."
"If they were ready, they would have brought a whole crew and a bunch of video equipment, a bunch more files, all kind of shit."
So you in no way feel that this is rushed.
We have no choice.
"I mean, I could get arrested any time."
"- Oh, stop."
- Or maybe killed.
Jesus Christ.
Time's not exactly on our side here.
Tomorrow?
Hmm.
"The partners aren't happy, Donald."
"I wouldn't call it exactly a revolt, but there's definite rumbling-- mostly about the Borns Tech case and your relationship with Lucy."
"That's over, and the partners' doubts will pass."
"Well-- if... we win the Borns case, maybe."
Or what?
They'll replace me?
I'd like to meet the man they have in mind.
Or the woman.
Listen.
"Please listen to me, Donald."
--ask Sorokin --we know better than that
What is this?
--A sauna --Precisely.
A fire hazard.
--And these are?
--Tennis courts
--How many of you work in that factory?
--11...
--Thousand?
"--Speaking --Pavel, I'm calling regarding the garages"
"I just want to know whose order it was, Vladimir Nikolaevich's?"
Mine.
So that 2 people can swing their raquets.
But it was your idea to delay the demolishion of these garages
Timing creates the necessary adjustments
Could you please sign this.
It's my reprimand for professional misconduct
--Did you call Mamaev?
No
"--When he calls, will you let me know?"
--Where?
In the clinic?
--Go make copies of this --Cut it out.
"You created this mess, and you fix it"
--I said it's a severe reprimand --I was hoping it might be a basic one
"--Young lady, you forgot to tear off the label --I cannot, I haven't bought the pants yet"
"--Pavel Ivanovich, what do you think..."
--Call Galkina here immediately!
--Will you sign it or stare at her pants?
--I will not sign
I already told you that I will not sign
"--But why, Pavel?"
"I guess I always thought it was about human limitation, both mental and physical."
"Okay, that..."
that just blew my face off.
"Well, I hope that helps."
It does.
"Thank you so much, Miss Murray."
This has been terrific.
"Hey, uh, before we go, do you mind if I use your restroom?"
It was a long drive up here.
"No, go right ahead."
We should do something without him sometime.
Do you like tapas?
Someone invited me out for that once.
"I thought they said topless, so I was like,"
(high-pitch): what?
That's a good story.
"Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what ""Snowbird"" was about."
"Well, you know, that's just the way"
I always interpreted the song.
But I suppose Gene probably could have explained it better than I.
Who's Gene?
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.
I see.
"But you wrote all your other songs, right?"
"No, all of my songs were written by other people."
"As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters."
Oh.
"So, you're just a big (bleep) liar?"
Sit back down.
"All right, come on, Stewie, let's go home... (muffled grunts)"
"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?"
I don't trust you in this hospital.
"And I certainly don't trust you with my patient of three years, who's extremely important."
I...
"If you want to stay on this case, you will stay out of my way."
"You will do what I tell you, and if you have something to say to or about my patient, you will raise your hand and wait to be called on."
You--you've got to be kidding me.
Yes.
"This is a joke, right?"
Do I look like I'm laughing?
You're upset.
I don't get upset with patients.
You're mad at me for killing those women.
I get that.
Would you feel differently if you knew that I was beaten as a child?
Every day.
It's how I learned to read.
I-I used to hide under the sink and sound out the letters on the detergent box.
Is that true?
Did it make you feel better?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
Did you do something bad?
Traffic violation.
"What's wrong with you, kid?"
I need a new liver and a new intestine.
Yeah?
You want mine?
Are you in the north terminal?
"Well, that's where she's supposed to be."
"No, no, do-don't go anywhere."
Just wait.
Never mind.

- who'd put it together again?
- Exactly.
"You know, I'm not sure how your father is gonna take it."
"Speaking of which, does he know?"
Not yet.
I think we should go tell Dan.
I'd like to.
"Let's do that, guys."
"Hey,Daniel."
"Hey,Marty!"
"Howareyou,partner?"
-Good.
"So, Dan..."
"I have some, um... some... what I consider to be sad news."
Fred Nolan has passed away.
"Formostof theirtime onOakIsland,Dan Blankenship and Fred Nolan were engaged"
-inanintenserivalry.
- Sit down.
Onewhichonlyseemed to grow even more bitter withthepassageoftime .
"Imean,it waslike the Hatfields and McCoys outhere,so now,regretfully,"
"Fred'spassedon , and it will bring change."
"Imean,thishas alwaysbeen  the Fred Nolan and Dan Blankenship story for 60 odd years and now it won't be anymore."
Do you remember when you first met Fred?
Yeah.
I came up here in '65.
Fred had been on the island several years earlier than I was.
I had quite a few conversations with him over the period of time.
The image of them having sex was so strong it kept recurring.
I wanted to fight it off.
"I read books, filled up volumes of my journal, but I couldn't overcome it."
I nearly wanted to go to a mental hospital everyday.
"Rationally, I knew I was a hopeless fool."
But I kept having a dirty feeling.
"She had a really hard time, too."
For several years.
I'm afraid you'll go through the same thing.
"I like you very, very much, but why'd you sleep with a foreigner, stupid?"
It's too strong of an image to overcome.
I'm afraid I'll go through that once again.
I don't think I could take it again.
"Hello, did you have breakfast?"
Not yet.
Did you?
"Yes, we did."
Would you like to have some bean sprout soup?
It's so easy to make.
We have all the ingredients.
Sounds good.
"But, my friend's here with me."
We're going to take a look around for a bit.
"Okay, then, see you later."
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Why are you two so close?
"Oh, I interviewed her yesterday."
I did it for my script.
We had a drink afterwards.
Enough.
Don't say more.
This is where I sleep.
I didn't get a chance to make the bed today.
Where do I sleep?
"Nixon was probably in office when this was made, but there's a brand-new mattress in there."
Most of your clothes should fit here.
Put the rest in the hall closet.
"I know it's a little bit out in the open, but..."
I didn't get a chance to finish your room here.
"Yeah, I'll fix that."
It's a work in progress.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
A few minor adjustments.
"Well, I guess I'll let you get unpacked."
You don't have to come in with me.
I'm your father.
I'm supposed to.
You don't know where to go.
It's okay.
"I mean, I have done this before - gone to school."
"All right, well, this is the name they gave me."
"Mrs Gwynn, main office."
I'll be back to pick you up at 3:30.
"Okay, sure, whatever."
"My door is always open and, contrary to hall rumour, you can talk to me."
"So, do you have any questions or concerns?"
"No questions, no answers."
All right.
This is Mr Campbell's class and he's expecting you.
"Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" represents a complete turning point in American history and literature."
"Do you want to take that cap off and tell us why, Mr Ricard?"
Gay rights?
- The Com-pote dude who wrote it...
- How is that saintly?
- ...she-asah il kol tzorki.
"My love, Jacob."
"If you ever loved me, stop."
- Stop.
- ...
She-asah il kol tzorki.
Stop.
Jacob?
Jacob?
Jacob?
"Jacob, you've had a complex partial seizure, which can cause psychosis, including religious psychosis."
Which means that this never was Jerusalem syndrome.
And I'm sure you're aware that were having these episodes.
Yes.
"What do you mean, you knew?"
How long has it been going on?
Since a few months before we went to the holy land.
That's when God first made himself known to me.
- No.
"- Oh, my God."
It isn't God.
It's epileptiform activity.
"Your brain has had spontaneous neural activity, and that's... that's what feels like God."
"We can't convince you of this right now, but what's more important is that we get you on the anti-seizure medication."
- And once the seizures stop...
- God will go away?
I don't want God to go away.
Repeat seizures can cause brain damage.
Listen to me.
"Yes, you are."
We need to section him.
They like a good buzz.
- Are you just trying to set me up?
- Why would I do that?
'Cause you want to see me fail.
"I mean, why else would you come here tonight?"
I just had nothing else to do.
"- Vodka, huh?"
- Grey Goose.
Hey.
Go take the kids shopping.
Get supplies for Judah-Fest.
"Yeah, I can do that, with money for both provisions and my services as a nanny/assistant."
Oh.
"Oh, that's how it's gonna be?"
"Well, according to my calculations,"
I will have fully repaid my debt to you as of my next excursion to the dry cleaner's.
"I'd like to double-check those numbers, if you don't mind."
"They're rough estimates, really."
"They're more projections, taking inflation into account."
"I got another bill today from your old alma mater, Hamadash La blah blah blah?"
"Over $5,000."
"Hamidrash I'Torah, and that happens to be tax-deductible."
"I don't pay taxes, you idiot."
There's a big harvest coming up in a couple of weeks.
Why don't you come back and help?
I'll put you on the payroll.
- I want more than Sanjay.
- Forget it.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"- Yeah, I'll take it."
- Welcome back.
- Jelly beans for the piñata.
I deny that we are intending to supply them with weapons.
These lies are useless.
We know you're helping the subversives.
I want names.
I have none to give you.
He told you already...
we don't know anything about the resistance!
I've heard that many times from many people.
Take him.
"Lieutenant, stop!"
That will not help either of us.
He's right.
Open up!
No!
Break it down!
I see soldiers out there.
Whas happening?
They're everywhere... searching the whole area.
I don't want to cause trouble for you.
I'll go soon asit's dark.
You've always been a troublemaker ever since you could walk.
I've never seen such a willful child.
But thas what I love most about you... your spirit.
"Now, don't worry."
"When they come through here, we'll be gone already."
"Now, your mother will want some of her things."
Ah...a pretty dress to wear.
They're only looking for me.
You don't have to get any more involved than you already are.
"Why, if my precious girl is involved then I'm involved, too."
Do you remember this?
She always used to wear it on special occasions.
So you've thought about where you'll put everything?
Like the interior design?
Yes.
"Yes, I have, Peter."
If this was the kitchen...
I'd like there to be a little nook right over there by the window.
Like the booth of a restaurant.
And there'd be an island right where the light is hanging... and the island would have the stove in it... and a countertop on one side with tall stools under it.
My daughter would sit on a stool... so I could talk to her while I was making dinner or lunch.
What would you say to her?
I'd say...
"""Hi, baby girl."
"You are a precious treasure."""
"I'd live up there, if I could."
If there wasn't gravity.
Yeah.
But if you lived up there... then all this stuff... all this stuff in my room... would fall down on you and crush you... and you'd die.
Ellen would have been so proud of you.
"Isn't it amazing, Ellen?"
Yes.
I'm so glad you took me here.
It was a whole civilization.
Two Mayan people in love... probably stood right where we're standing now and thought...
"""Look what we have built together."""
"And now they're gone, and so is the city."
And there's just... us.
I am done.
That was great.
- Eldercab.
- Hi.
- I'm feeling too old to drive.
- Yeah?
"Tom, what do I do now?"
Frankie.
You were always interested in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33.
"Yeah, I still read a lot."
I get good stuff in there.
"You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with ""regimes,"" ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."
-And it worked.
"-Yeah, it worked."
"Those were the great old days, you know."
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
"Yeah, it was once."
Frankie.
When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors.
"Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened."
And their families were taken care of.
"That was a good break, a nice deal."
Yeah.
They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party before they did it.
"Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels."
"Thanks, Tom."
Thanks.
"-See you, Tom."
"-Addio, Frankie."
Kay.
You have to go.

is this what we were missing?
What were we missing?
Why do you bang that bottle down on the piano?
That's my livelihood!
You shouldn't put it there!
I paid for it.
Isn't it undignified to take the bottle with you?
It's not undignified.
You ordered Martell.
"You left it there, you acted like noble ladies."
Miss didn't want to dance...
For heaven's sake!
For heaven's sake!
I only spoke to those boys on her behalf.
You only spoke on her behalf!
Why did you need to do that?
Why did you have to say that?
What good is that to us?
And what does the Martell matter!
Here we lost thousands...
"Heavens, you made such a fuss there, until now we haven't been anywhere, and when we do go, all you care about is one Martell... all you care about is one Martell..."
People were paying thousands!
But I have to watch the budget.
It's always only you!
Your budget!
Always only you!
We've had this for years.
"Years, and now you even... I told her I didn't need to go there."
She even made an expensive dress.
This is an expensive dress?
"The dressmaker laughed, she called it a rag."
So what kind of modern dress does she want?
You did.
"Bullshit, you could have come to me privately."
- We could've had a conversation.
"- I did it when this thing started,"
- and I'm not doing it again.
- You son of a bitch.
- He's right.
- What?
"Alex is right, you gave him no choice."
"God damn it, Harvey, that prison is doing shady shit."
His client doesn't care because all they care about is money.
And you knew that when you handed it off
- and said you'd live by it.
- This is about you
- coming into a courtroom and...
"- Okay, that's it!"
It's done.
I don't want to hear another word about Reform Corp or Masterson Construction ever again.
You made your bed.
Now you're gonna sleep in it.

"Donna, you have a minute?"
"Louis, if you're here to berate me for what I said to Stephanie, then, no, I don't."
"Uh, that is not why I'm here."
I came to tell you that I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you weeks ago.
You're gonna have to be a little more specific.
You kept telling me that I wasn't dealing with Tara.
"Well, I finally started, and I think because of that, it allowed me to get past my anger and make peace with Stephanie."
"I'm glad to hear it, Louis."
I'm proud of you.
"Like I said, I wish I had listened to you sooner."
But I felt like it was the right thing to do.
"Look, I know you and my father used to hate each other,"
But that was a long time ago.
You are the only one
Still having this fight.
He has moved on.
Is everything okay?
Rufus went to the board and blocked dad
From getting the apartment.
"Serena, that's absurd."
Rufus would never do something like that.
"I would, to protect my marriage."
"I don't trust William's intention,"
And I don't want him living under my roof.
"Rufus, you're being completely paranoid."
"At first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family,"
And now he's moving into the building
To get closer to you.
"I told you, he's moving in to be close to the children."
All I see here is jealousy run amok.
"Mom, come on."
We should go.
"Lil Rufus, it's probably best if you don't come tonight."
What are you two doing here?
This is an alumni event.
Columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students.
"We'd invite you to join, but they were very explicit-"
No fake students allowed.
"Hey, doctor."
"If you'll excuse me a moment,"
I should go say hello to a few old colleagues.
I'll be right back.
"No, I've been waiting here to apologise."
"Well, well."
"Not to you, not now, but, well, to the United States."
We accept your apology.
Look.
I came here with good intentions and at another time
"I might admit you had provocation the other night, but for a grown man to..."
"Well, it's positively disgraceful and I ruined my best pair of nylons."
"Have you any idea what nylons cost these days, if you can get them?"
"Whatever it was, it was worth it."
"So help me, next time I have a bottle I'll launch that guy."
Hold it!
"Keep trying, Plotski."
Poletski.
"What's the matter, Cookie?"
I got my walking papers.
They're sending me back to my old unit.
You'll be the best cook in the British Army.
Not me.
I've applied for a transfer to the Commandos.
"Hey, you've got something there."
"Not a hope, McKendrick."
I couldn't possibly agree to a transfer.
Look.
Do you realise what it costs to train just one parachutist?
"Over £5,000."
"If I transfer you, what have we got for our money?"
Absolutely nothing.
"There are two ways a man can get out of here, by refusing to jump or feet first."
"Is that final, Sir?"
"Of course, you could refuse to jump."
"All right, you can fall out."
"Come on, Magnum."
"Go, Magnum, go.!"
Hit it!
Remember.!
Knees to chest.!
"Chop-chop, chaps."
To the van.
Come on.
I was dying.
"Everything confirmed it... my lungs, my head, my aching muscles."
"So, I concentrated on Roger."
I tried to think of all the reasons Roger didn't leave the island... when he knew the mafia and the feds were on his tail.
It came down to either a great love for Babs... or he couldn't get his hands on the money.
Yeah.
I settled on the money too.
"I thought of all the ways it might be tied up... investments, stocks, gold, land... ways that would take a while to liquidate."
After 26 miles...
I decided it was none of the above.
"He'd hidden it somewhere, and he couldn't put his hands on it immediately."
"By the time I got on the bicycle, I was ready to fall over dead."
I'd never make a hundred miles.
There was no way.
Not even if I concentrated on Roger and his problem.
Impossible.
But I had to try.
Beauty Knows No Pain.
He'd hidden the money.
He had to.
"The statute of limitations was almost up, but he couldn't get it because... it was inaccessible."
I had it.
I had the answer.
"Only I was so damn tired, I couldn't pull it out of my brain."
"Soon-shin, talk to me!"
What went wrong?
"Why, sir?"
I must know why you made such an unfair decision?
Are you really oblivious as to why you failed?
Ask your father.
How dare you even think to apply for the exam!
There is no place for descendents of traitors in the royal court?
Good hunting today.
"Here, it's your share."
"I was the lead today, isn't that right?"
Then my share is larger than that.
"Why are you sitting out here, wife?"
"Oh, you're back."
"It's been months since the exam, and Shoo-shin is yet to find peace."
I'm concerned.
Will he ever be all right?
One must hit the bottom to bounce back.
He must undergo what he must.
Let's just watch him.
I shouldn't have encouraged him.
I had resented you.
A part of me was angry with you for not allowing the boys to pursue their studies.
And I had hopes.
I believed that someone in this world would give my boy a chance... that their spirit and talent would be recognized...
Innkeeper!
Innkeeper!
Bring me more wine!
More wine!
I'm coming!
Stop this now.
Stop!
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
It means I could shoot you from Texas.
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
"I know, I know."
"It's always a tough lesson to learn, to realize that you don't have the stomach to do what's needed."
Mm-hmm.
Just came by 'cause I need a little favor.
None of your favors are little.
"Okay, you know what?"
I'm done flirting.
I'm not in the mood.
"I got to get in touch with that guy you told me about, the smuggler -- Schmidt was his name."
The guy you said could move anything or anybody.
Why do I tell you things?
Why?
"'Cause I think deep down, you like me."
No.
"No, that's not it."
"Okay, look, the point is, we got to get out of town with fresh I.D.s, okay -- someplace warm, with decent beer."
That's why we need Schmidt.
"W-well, I'm sorry."
"Your timing sucks, okay?"
Schmidt's in hiding.
He's in some sort of trouble.
"No cell, no e-mail, no nothing."
"You know, it's funny -- I bet the guy who builds his computer systems could find him."
"Say, wasn't that you, Dixon?"
Even if I could -- and I'm not saying that I can -- there is zero chance that he'll talk to you.
"All right, Dixon."
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Really appreciate it.
"But, you know, before I go, I thought I would just say"
I think it's great that a company like this would hire a convicted hacker!
Should I go on?
Shh.
"How about the Navy, when they almost court-martialed you for stealing the skipper's porn collection?"
"And then there was Mo Black's brother, Fat Andy."
"And his guys, Frankie the Wop and Freddy No Nose."
"And then there was Pete the Killer, who was Sally Balls' brother."
Then you had Nickey Eyes and Mikey Franzese.
"Jimmy Two-Times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice."
"I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers."
What is this?
Coats?
"I need suits, Henry, not coats."
Suits are up on Thursday.
"I know, but this is the middle of the fucking summer."
What am I gonna do with fur coats?
You don't want furs?
I'll take the furs away.
"No, don't take them away, I want them."
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
How's that?
"For us, to live any other way was nuts."
"To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day and worried about bills, were dead."
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
"If we wanted something, we just took it."
"If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.
"Frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?"
520 ain't even close to 469.
What he fuck does that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
It's all there.
Don't worry about the alarms. I just gotta find a way to get the key.
-No problems?
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
"So, I was home for about an hour."
My plan was to start the dinner early so Karen and I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta for her trip later that night.
"I kept looking out the window, and I saw that the helicopter was gone."
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your uncle Michael.
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce.
and Karen and I started out.
"Oh, God."
I see it.
- I see it.
"Look, it's right there."
- Damn!
- That's it.
- There it is.
We got to get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.
"Go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house."
Nothing.
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
Let's go shopping.
"I'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning."
I'm telling you.
Fine.
In her purse.
At the bar.
"Jules, I know I'm not like her."
I just...
I wanna be a great mom so bad that...
I'm afraid I'm never gonna be able to have fun again.
Of course you can.
Just because you have a kid doesn't mean you have to change who you are.
All you have to do is...
Girl: - [ Giggles ] Let's go dance.
Girl #2:
- Yeah!
Trust your instincts.
Mm.
"Laurie, you're a mom."
And not just because you have a baby.
It's because of who you are and the love that you have in your heart.
I've seen the way you hold him.
"And even when you go out and you get a little crazy, the thing you're gonna be most excited about is to get home and see your son."
All my mom ever wanted to do at the end of the night was go to an airport hotel and see if any hair bands were staying there.
She once took her top off in a hot tub and caused a fistfight between Kip Winger and the lead singer of Quiet Riot.
Please don't tell me that you--
Poolside in her purse.
"If I close my eyes, I can still hear them arguing."
"My God, she was not a great mom."
"It sounded like she had great boobs, though."
- She did.
- Mm.
"But you're right, Jules."
"The end of tonight, the thing that I am most looking forward to is getting home and being with my baby."
I know.
- Come here.
It's just... it's never gonna end until we stop her.
"Look, Bastion employs 130 people."
I can't endanger their livelihoods if I can fix this in one night.
Right.
You're right.
"If she wants you to help her organize and find a location, that's a small price to pay."
When's the last time we did it in front of the mirror?
Grace... she didn't just come over to talk about the location.
Her name is Audrey.
She's going to be my date.
She's beautiful.
I'm sure you'll show her a good time.
You gonna jump?
Oh!
"You know, with my luck,"
I'd end up surviving the fall and end up eating my food through a straw the rest of my life.
You sure you should be smoking?
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you freaking kidding me?
A heart attack would be fantastic right about now.
Can I turn this off?
"Look, everything's going to be fine, Victor."
I just need you to show me every illegal transaction that you've made.
"I promise you, it will only stay between us."
Are you wearing a wire?
Huh?
What the hell is the matter with you?
"You're with them, aren't you?"
The SEC.
They got you to cooperate.
"Victor, I'm here to help."
All right?
That they took what looks like the most boring words in the English language and made them into a sentence?
"Well, I've always been fascinated by this stuff."
It's just the beast took up most of my brain.
Now you're free to really get your nerd on?
Exactly.
I wasted all that time on the beast when I could have been charting the development of metallurgy during the 19th century.
Is Shannon Kelly here?
Kyle Weathers.
I've come a long way to find you.
Thanks.
This is Tom.
Tom.
Good to meet you.
Hi.
"We're short on daylight, so I'll come straight to the point."
The beast is in my sights and you're the girl to help me find it.
- Excuse me?
- I've been monitoring your blog for the last six months.
Your findings are pretty compelling.
Why didn't you leave any comments?
Open up myself to replies from fools with no brains and even less imagination?
I know exactly what you mean.
Right.
I'm searching the woods tonight and I need an expert.
- What do you say?
- She's into metalgy...
"Metal...metallurgy now, you see."
Old news.
Tell me more.
Don't worry.
No-one can get in.
And we're not getting out.
When I see him...
He will still think of me when he sees me again.
"Well, first take the money that we owe him..."
I don't want his money!
"I want...never, I want nothing more from him..."
And his child I don't want at all!
Why should it live?
He himself never wanted it but... he shall see it!
First he shall see it and know how it feels when all is taken from one.
"Then I will kill it and myself, too."
But first I'll go to this shit of a dad and throw the dead kid at his feet!
Let him see how his conscience is dead.
"He'll cry and curse, that dog..."
I don't know where to go anymore.
My employer has fired me.
I have no place to sleep...
"I have no money, no papers."
Nothing.
Nothing at all...
"Well, have the child first, and the rest will follow."
"Going by the laundry, small wonder that he's run off..."
- Did you eavesdrop again?
- My hearing is excellent.
Bring the suitcase to Mrs Kunze.
She has a room free.
She can stay there.
"- Well, when are you due?"
- That's none of your damn business!
For how long should I rent the room then?
- For as long as she works for me.
- Under the table?
With no money and no papers?
It's not so bad.
The Gagnon Nursery is full of Kings just like it.
Kings just like it?
She loved dogs...
especially coIIies.
They were all named King.
"When the Iast one died in the spring, she didn't replace him."
"She said, she could go anytime, and the family would have enough to care for polo never mind a dog."
So she bought a little plaster negro.
"Her "" little King""."
Poor old lady.
She was totally lost.
She kept asking:
"What do we do, Bertrand?"
We can't call the cops just for that.
I Iooked at him:
"maybe not call the cops... but still, you can't smash everything you find ugly."
"while we were wondering,"
polo decided to taste the nigger.
He does that with strangers.
"He goes up to them, he smells them, and sometimes even licks them."
And how did the kid react?
Of course we all feel weird the first time.
He was no different.
He started smiling.
It was the only time we saw him smile.
She went to get him and said:
"Forgive him, he means no wrong."
It always upset her when it happened.
She would always say the same thing:
"polo, come on, we don't do that."
"You can look at them, you can smell them."
"The idea is to keep girl from leaving, not drive them away."
Frannie'd have found a way around this.
"Let's play ""What would Frannie do?"""
Go with me girl.
She'd make Lizzi cry.
And?
Tie her up and put her on a basement somewhere.
I don't know.
- The Kappa Taus have a basement.
"- Buffalo Bill, let's put a pin in that."
Wait...
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.
You just have got to be the #1 weapon on the fight for abstinence.
I thought you enjoyed being ravaged by me in super places.
It's like we're secret sex spies.
I say we remove cars from our list of spy places.
"We're running out of places, library, aiport,"
- that church.

Did you kill every soldier outside?
Certainly not.

What?
Never mind.
I'm gonna tell you how it makes you feel.
"See, for the past week, I've been seeing therapists... and they've been trying to get me to talk."
But I don't like it.
Partly because it's none of their bloody business.
But mostly because I'm afraid if...
"I do start to open up and let it out,"
I might completely fall apart.
Is that how it makes you feel?
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
So I just don't wanna talk about it at all.
"But it doesn't make you any less angry, does it?"

- No.
Reinhardt's had an on-and-off thing with Laura's mother.
With Gillian Booth?
Really?
"If she knew he was harassing her daughter, could she hurt him?"
"Well, singers talk to other singers."
She could make it very hard for him to get hired somewhere else.
There comes a time in every man's life when he wants to be left alone.
"Now, go away."
"All right, who wants the queen of the may?"
"How about you, handsome?"
You look like Cary Grant.
You want to dance with me?
"I'd love to, Queenie but, well, one of the other girls asked me first."
"Bye, darling."
Bye.
"Any cigars left, Cookie?"
"Come on, Cookie, get me a cigar."
What's the matter?
You on their team now?
You think I'm the guy?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I understand how you feel.
It's sort of rough one American squealing on other Americans.
"Then again, Cookie maybe that stoolie's not an American at all."
Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks.
They do that sometimes.
"Just put an agent in with us, a trained specialist."
Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp.
Not just whether somebody's trying to escape.
"What outfit we were with where we were stationed, how our radar operates."
"Could be, couldn't it?"
In this barracks?
Why not?
Just one of the boys.
"Sharing our bunks, eating our chow."
Right in amongst the ones that beat me up.
Except he beat hardest.
Who is it?
"Look, you guys need a division title and my man will deliver like Amazon, all right?"
"He's got breakaway speed, durability out the ass."
He will finally put your offense over the top.
I think you might be right.
- Can I see him work out?
- Absolutely.
"I'm gonna coordinate that with you, Charles."
"- Thank you, Larry."
- Larry:
Don't mention it.
"Sorry, babe, we gotta stick a pin in brunch."
Fuck me and not feed me?
Fuck you.
We'll eat quick.
"Come on, I want stone crabs."
I don't get it.
Jason just said the same thing I did.
"He said it better, Charles."
Be grateful.
"You may not have got it the way you wanted it, but you got it nonetheless."
Now go coordinate.
- ( horse neighs )
"- I spent 250,000 on American Pharoah's supersonic splooge."
"You better deliver me the next Secretariat or you'll be shoveling the most colossal mountain of horse shit you've ever seen, okay?"
- ( phone ringing )
- Giddy up.
"Hey, I'm seeing you at the stable in 30, right?"
"Yeah, listen, Wayne, I just have to push that back by a few, okay?"
"Hey, Reggie, put Vernon on the phone, please?"
- Wayne:
How few is a few?
- Just a few hours.
I'm kind of nervous.
"Ryan, could you quit fretting over your nerd gear for like five seconds?"
"We have a real crisis on our hands, unless Summer's wrong, and I'm not completely insufferable."
"- Why didn't you just tell me, then?"
- It was kind of hard getting a word in.
"I mean, you're a good talker, but you're not so"
Summer's right then.
"I have to do, I have to change."
I have to be a better person.
Better how?
"Uh, less selfish."
"More selfless, less take, more give."
"- Less pitching, more catching."
"- Look, man, I'm used to it."
You don't have to change for me.
"- Oh, I'm not changing for you."
"- For who then, Summer?"
"Uh, no, no, uh, uh, I"
- I think for the greater good of man.
"There's no hidden agenda here, like say, getting Summer back?"
"Dude, I don't even want Summer back."
"Unless... that is what she wants, in which case, that's not about me."
"That's about... me supporting her, and her wanting of, of, of me..."
"But I think that's what she wants, okay?"
Just admit it... you want her back.
No.
"No, I don't."
"- It's the new me, Ryan."
"World, wrap your head around the new Seth Cohen."
- You're talking about yourself in the third person
How is Seth's hair right now?
"- Oh, you can thank me later."
What lessons?
Violin lessons.
Is your violin tuned up well?
"Yes, but I first have to admit something to you, professor."
Tell me.
"What is it, Uluc?"
I am really bored with this violin.
Shall we just move on to another instrument?
Another instrument?
"Yes, professor."
I don't know.
Something more popular.
"For example, we have some entertainment nights in Urfa."
Entertainment nights?
Haven't you ever heard of it?
"For example, the Mici of Kahta... or may God rest his soul, the Boiler Bedih..."
"Yes, what do we do now?"
- What do you mean by what do we do?
"- Meaning, what's our new plan?"
"It's the fatal exam robbery, Chapter 2."
Are you doing this on purpose?
Speak in Turkish.
- That means we'll rob a bank.
- What bank?
The question bank.
The test exams for intensive courses.
Come on.
Why are we stealing them?
It's just a test exam as we call it.
"Because every week, their results are being mailed home."
"When our marks are low, our parents at home start nagging."
I can't take that anymore.
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
"I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped."
"Tommy, you're so marvelous."
"That's all there is to it, I suppose."
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
"If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub."
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
"- Stand guard, will you?"
- Yeah.
"Never mind that, Sergeant."
Stand easy.
"- Good evening, Colonel."
"- Evening, Stebbins."
"- Good evening, Major."
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
"That's very nice of you, sir."
I'll bring Emmy to you.
"- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant."
"- Yes, sir."
"Very jolly, sir."
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
"Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill."
Nonsense.
Stebbins is famous for his punch.
You dim little shit.
I hired you out of pity and this is how you repay me.
"Tomorrow, when people find out that your precious president.."
helped a maniac open the nuclear football..
"who do you think they're going to believe, you or me?"
"You, you would be a nobody."
"But me, I'm the president of the United States."
"No, you're not."
"Eli, Eli."
"Quite the politician, huh?"
You did all of this just to keep your buddies in the defence industry happy.
How far did you fall into their pockets?
This is ridiculous.
"Take him into custody, general."
"Yes, sir, Mr. President."
"No, I'm still president."
I am still president.
"Well, just consider this a coup d'état."
Get this trash off my lawn.
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!
You're selling this country out to the Arabs.
This isn't over.
I got friends.
And I'll make sure all of your friends meet you in prison.
Let's get him to the hospital.
You okay?
You look terrible.
Thank you for everything you did today.
Thank you for trusting me.
Special Agent Cale!
I'm not going anywhere without my protection.
"You know, his eyes."
"I swear, I'll never forget his eyes as long as I live."
He wasn't breathing.
I saw him die.
There was blood...
"Oh, God."
"Okay, sir, calm down."
Tell me where he was;
I need an address.
In an alley off of 57th.
You-you got to send someone out there.
"We will, but I need you to stay on the line with me, okay?"
Police say the call came in at 5:47 this morning.
- Tracks with Michael's account.
- Sounded genuinely upset.
Connection to the victim?
None that I can find.
I searched e-mail accounts and phone records for both Michael Thomas and Petty Officer Adams.
No communication between them.
Michael's boss said that Adams was never a customer at the shop.
Background.
"Petty Officer Caleb Adams joined the Navy right out of high school, had two overseas deployments and a spotless record."
C.O. called him a bright and hardworking man.
Assigned to the Hagen destroyer in 2010.
Adams was one of 215 sailors off the ship last night for liberty.
"Tracking down others who may have been with him, but we do have this."
He called someone named Meredith Bilson five times in five hours.
The last call came in at 4:34 a.m..
That's an hour before his death.
Location?
Apartment manager at her last known address says she hasn't lived there in three months.
Keep looking.
But if you hurt Lucien... you know what could happen if his gang finds out what you did and why.
Eye for an eye.
They gonna come after me.
"Or worse, take it out on Chivonne."
That's why I asked you here.
"Talk me out of it, to help me find another way."
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
We were just having an illuminating conversation with Anezka here.
Thanks.
You can go.
We'll be in touch.
What's going on?
HOLMES:
"Were you aware that when Tendu disappeared, he was in the company of a woman named Libena Havel?"
No.
"No, I wasn't."
BELL:
"Apparently, she's his girlfriend."
"When we heard her name, it struck us that we'd already met one Czech woman, Anezka."
Having two different Czechs wrapped up in the same case seemed like more than a coincidence.
HOLMES:
We wondered if she and Anezka knew each other.
"If they did, Anezka could help us find Libena, which, in turn, could help us find Tendu."
"Anezka gave us this, from a gaming convention a few months back."
"She identified this girl as Libena, another of your trade show models."
"She said Libena and Tendu met at a party last week, here at this house."
Yeah.
HOLMES:
She also told us that she and Libena were more than just models.
They're prostitutes.
BELL:
-You look lovely.
"-l look good, huh?"
You look wonderful.
Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you.
"Don't paint any more religious pictures, please."
God be with you.
We always called each other goodfellas.
You'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us. """
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew you've got to be 100 percent Italian so they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
"See, it's the highest honor they can give you."
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
"It also means you can fuck around with anybody, just as long as they aren't also a member."
It's like a license to steal.
It's a license to do anything.
"Hey, how many years ago was it you was made?"
"Ah, I'm an old-timer."
Thirty years ago.
"30 years, huh?"
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a fuckin' pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
- That's just me.
- Yeah?
"Well, I'm starting... the bottomless trend."
"Hence, the bottomless party."
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.
- Where are you going?
"- Bang bang, buddy."
Listen.
I'm really sorry to bother you with this.
- You all right?
- Not really.
"They were locked up for less than an hour, and they already escaped?"
Damn it.
Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.
Don't need the public thinking we're some two-bit operation.
"Got it, sir."
It must have been either al-Qaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.
Find out if they have any relatives in the country.
You probably should have done that in the first place.
"Do you have a problem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?"
I'm just saying that...
I've looked through the files on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.
"Other than a couple of traffic tickets, they're clean."
Right.
That's why they just broke out of prison.
But they--It's not even clear that they should have been there in the first place.
Shut your--
"You see this cute, little white girl, Beecher?"
Yeah.
I don't think we get to see him enough.
There's a Iot of things said about the mom's spirit and feeling towards it.
"But dads do feel it as well, especially at 1 7."
You'd love to have that son around you.
Your watch!
could I have a look at that watch you got on?
AII I had to offer him was to take him drinking and playing snooker.
I didn't really have an awful lot to offer him but that's part of your establishment as a young man.
And that time went.
I've missed it.
I've missed it.
You popping back in tomorrow?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the only fellow in the family.
He's gone.
"AII right, Iet me get ready and then I'II be up, talk to you."
Got a....
Got a show today.
I'm exhausted.
Let's go!

"When John McGarrett was investigating his wife's murder, he found a lot of evidence, bits and pieces."
Not all of it made sense to him at the time.

CIA used it to fund black ops.
"If I gave those numbers to a reporter friend of mine and he started digging, who knows what he might come up with."

Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values... and something terrible is born.

And do everything we planned.

- Thirty years?

"No, we had a problem."

Wow drama in a wedding that's shocking.
Yeah well Jill wants this chapel filled with eight thousand red roses and some like...
Eighty thousand dollar wedding dinner and seven thousand dollar wedding dress.
And her dad won't cover the entire tab.
Wow I'm very glad that I'm not Drew right now.
Or her dad.
"Yeah but that's just Jill, you know?"
Only love her for it she's extravagant.
You know I've known her since I was eleven.
We went to boarding school together.
You went to boarding school when you were eleven.
Did you miss your parents a lot?
Yeah... it's complicated.
When did you get home to see them?
"Well on the holidays, or you know the occasional odd long weekend."
I liked boarding school.
It was what I needed.
How do you mean?
Well my parents died when I was a kid.
I told you that right?
No I'm very sorry I didn't know that.
How did they die together?
No they actually died separately.
Um my was when I was 5.
My mom when I was 11.
"Oh no, no, no it's not sad."
It was a really long time ago.
I just don't talk about it much because...
Um what about your parents?
They're... still together right?
"Still together yeah, after 30 years."
And totally in love with each other.
I know.
It seems like it just expanded.
You are not trying to get these back in here.

So you don't throw away some personal items.
I love you so much.
So much.

I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy.
Will you marry me?
"Yes, of course I will."
Yes.
Yes.

Or just pre the fight.
And you got to spar with a former middleweight champion.
Oh...
If only there were a clip of that(!
)
So...
"Can I just say, he's an ex-world champion, and I'm not!"
I don't think you needed to say that.
"When you watch it, just remember Rob is not a professional boxer."
Have a little look.
Aw...
Hands up!
You need waking up!
Listen to us first.
"We took you away from the Germans, didn't we?"
"I do not ask, I understand..."
We'll untie you today... and tomorrowyou'll order us to be executed...
"No, no, captain..."
They are young and stupid...
We want to help.
We've heard that our...
yourtroops are planning an offensive...
There is a minefield overthere.
We've laid all these mines.
We know all the passages and can showthem.
And what?
Do you think you'll score any points forthat?
"You maywant to receive awards forthat, eh?"
Who is going to believe you afteryou voluntarily defected?
"It is not so simple, captain."
"Grisha received a heavywound and was captured unconscious, and Valera followed him to the camp and was wounded later."
It is a heart-breaking story.
This is exactly what is called a voluntary defection.
and high treason.
"What should we do, then?"
- May be...
Yes!
-What's up?
Are you nuts?
"Come to your senses, folks?"
"Excuse us for doing anything wrong, comrade captain."
and for being harsh with you.
Sit down!
It is them!
- Hands up!
That's a complete lie.
I can't believe that you are willing to destroy
My relationship with my father because you're too scared
That yours won't love you for who you really are.
You were right.
We need to make these decisions together.
"But the truth is, consulting with someone else"
Doesn't come easily to me.
I get it.
"Vanessa, I totally support you going."
"Thank you, but I'm not taking the internship."
I'd rather lose the job than lose you.
You're not gonna lose me if you go to Haiti.
We're-we're-we're gonna find a way to make this work.
All right?
But you gotta go.
"I don't want to, and we both know"
It's better for our relationship if I stayed.
"I mean, three months is too long, and..."
I just wanna be with you.
Are you sure?
You're-you're making this decision for you?
Not me?
Not-not-not even us?
Uh...
Okay.
"Let's find a way to celebrate tonight, then-a fun way."
"We could, uh..."
Let's see.
You want to sneak 40s
"Into the midnight showing of ""the lost weekend"""
At film forum?
"Yes, one."
From which point at the airport will we shoot it down?
Only I know that.
"That way, none of you can betray our plan."
Our friend Silveira knows many ways of loosening silent men's tongues.
I know that all too well.
- But what if they arrest you?
- Then the plan falls through.
They're at the gate.
- That's definitely the president's car.
- No doubt about it.
The information was correct.
Ramírez is here.
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
We've received an encoded message saying that the plane will land on runway 3.
I will disrupt the electricity at the end of the runway for 20 seconds.
- Stand by.
- All right.
We must get to that sewer over there.
"If he doesn't manage to cut off the electricity, that's it."
Exactly.
That would be it.
Sánchez Granstev.
- Hello.
I'd just like to check something.
- Is anything wrong?
"No, everything's fine."
There just seems to be a minor problem with the transformer.
We'll have it fixed in no time at all.
It will only take a few minutes.
I'll go back to my post.
Oh!
"I have to say, Rose, I'm a little confused."
A little disappointed.
Everything was going so well.
"At least, I thought so."
Didn't you?
Is that the truth or some kind of female manipulation?
Tell me the truth.
"You knew the arrangement, how I felt."
Did you think that would change?
Why?
"I hoped, though I made the offer, you'd see there was no need for it."
I'd hoped that we'd gone beyond it.
Did you honestly think this was the next step?
What we have usually comes after all this nonsense is over.
Most people never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going.
Or find another.
"Our relationship works, because it isn't physical."
I took every precaution to make sure there was no physical attraction!
"Rose, I'm sorry."
I've never had this with a woman before.
I can share everything with you.
Are you not satisfied with me?
Maybe this is something we have to struggle through together.
Maybe this tour is coming at a good time.
Maybe we can use the distance.
Don't you think?
I thought we were good friends.
"Talk to me, Rose."
Let me in.
I'm sorry.
Get up there.
- Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
- Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere...
I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."""
Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
Tell me where you saw him.
"On a slab in the morgue, burned to a crisp."
I think we'd better sit down.
Her whole body had gone soft when I slugged her with it.
"But I kept thinking, she has to know something."
Take a couple of deep drags.
Thanks.
I won't do that again.
Tell me what happened.
"Please, I promise--"
"You're not feeling ill, Mrs. Chandler?"
"No, I feel fine, thanks."
It isn't often we have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Chandler dance.
"Mr. Murdock, this is Mr. Martinelli, who owns all this."
Mr. Murdock's an old f riend.
Any f riend of Mrs. Chandler's is welcome.
I'm af raid i don't sing.
Perhaps you'd like to try a little roulette.
"It's not wise to tell you, but the house is having a streak of bad luck."
Mrs. Chandler doesn't feel like gambling.
"Oh, I'm all right, really I am."
I'd like to.
"You too, sir?"
I'll just watch.
Roulette wheels have a way of running over me.
I was walking into something.
"We were going to gamble, win or lose."
"He hadn't asked her to, he'd told her she had to. lt was an order, but why?"
I didn't like the feeling I had about her.
The way I wanted to put my hand on her arm.
The way I kept smelling that jasmine in her hair.
The way I kept hearing that song she'd sung.
"No, nothing I can think of, nothing specific."
"And this Mr. Samuels, the guy who made a pass at you, did you complain in front of Daniel Zucco?"
"Ye-Yes, Neva, last night, and-and he listened very carefully."
"- Yes, he did."
"- Where did this ""Samuel"" live?"
"Oh, come on!"
"Hey, look, young lady."
It's 10:30.
"In a couple of hours,"
Daniel Zucco is gonna reach out of the grave and kill somebody.
"Now, I don't know what this Samuels did to you, but do you think he deserves to die for it?"
No.
He's out in Rockville Center.
So's the place where I work.
"From there to Midtown Manhattan, could it be done in less than two and a half hours?"
"[Neva] Yeah, you could do it in that easy."
- Crocker!
- [Ticking]
Go talk to her.
"[Sighs] Well, what does that mean?"
"I mean, what am I supposed to tell her?"
That I feel a certain kind of love for her?
That I feel a certain responsibility toward her?
"Well, I don't want to be in charge of an outpatient anymore."
"Honey, you will never know how hard I've worked on that relationship."
- It's over.
"- Alex, for three years,"
I sat at a desk not 15 feet away from you... on the other side of a tiny wall that thick.
I paid your bills.
I balanced your checkbook.
I mixed your drink.
I apologized to your psychiatrist when you didn't wanna see him.
- Pete?
"- Yeah, this was cold."
- This is pretty rough.
- I can see the rosiness...
- I almost didn't give you my jacket.
"- Yeah, just to be a douche."
- Just because I was so cold.
"- I thought you would have to have some major, like, Lord of the Rings CGI on my nipples because it was..."
It was like...
Nipples isn't PG-13.
They were like...
I got to the point where I couldn't feel my extremities.
"I mean, it was so cold."
"I was in a damn T-shirt, you know?"
T-shirt.
"In Lord of the Rings, are they known for their nipple CGI?"
Yes.
What do you think?
Of course.
"Oh, awkward pause."
Anyway...
"That jacket, by the way, the jacket that I put on you which is a jacket that we actually wore in like..."
"It kind of provided a bit of warmth, but not as much as you'd think."
"- No, it was like..."
- Like a thin cotton.
- It was like wearing a plastic bag.
- Yeah.
"Actually, wearing a plastic bag would've been warmer."
Look at all this.
"Okay, so let's talk about..."
- Tension.
"- The time where they had to stop the van short and I flew back and I, like, landed on my bad wrist that I had a minor surgery and stuff on in the exact spot, like on a metal drum pole."
"Well, yeah, that's why I didn't tell 'em."
"Growing up, I.A. was worse than the bogeyman in my house."
Then why take the job?
Because I want to be a detective.
"When I passed the exam, they gave me a choice--"
I.A. or back to patrol-- I took I.A.
Double chili cheeseburger.
You want something?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
You hate the streets that much?
"No, it's just not my goal."
I did patrol because it was required.
Then just wait for another department to open up.
For how long?
I've already spent five years of my life on patrol.
Now I'm required to put in two more years on the job before I can even think about moving up to homicide.
Homicide?
That's your goal?
So that's how it is?
I.A.'s just another requirement.
"The minute your time's up with us, you're history?"
And I.A. was always your goal?
No.
But that's completely different.
I was pregnant with my first son.
I had to get off the street.
"I understand, but why are you so upset?"
Because I love this job.
"I may have joined I.A. because of the great hours, but I stay because I believe in what we do."
"Unlike you, I'm not just biding my time."
I am not biding my time.
- Is that not okay?
"- It is, but I might have a date."
"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Should I cancel our trip so you can go on the date you might have?
"No, obviously you should go."
- What's that sound?
"- I don't know, Rob."
- You should be in bed.
- Mom?
That always happens at this time.
You just were never up this early.
"It's the lights, Robby."
See these street lights?
They're run by a big computer that tells them when to go on and off.
That's what that sound is.
"So, forthe purpose of this role-play, Shamus is holding a grenade."
"The juice is a grenade, so the worst thing we can do is act afraid."
"Because Shamus is already scared, and he's taking his cues from us."
We will want to exit in an orderly fashion... telling Shamus with our actions... that he cannot get our attention in this inappropriate manner.
Hey.
Hi.
"So, do you have anything new in the chest?"
"You know, the hope chest?"
- What's the hope chest?
- It's... nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ellen broke up with me.
What?
Why?
She thinks she's gonna die this week.
No.
"Out of everyone at Saint Tod, she is the least likely person to die."
Peace)
What to do?
"God paired us off, did He?"
That's a colourful dress
You look like a movie hero
I wanted to wear a suit.
But little brotherJagadish forced me into this
We're three of us.
Jai is the other brother.
He's studying in America
Om-Jai-Jagadish!
It's like a prayer
Our photo
When we were kids
Have you ever fallen in love at first sight?
I have just chosen my mate for life!
And his name is Om
"What are you doing, Shanti?"
He promotes new singers
So I think I'll sing for him
"I tell you, I love you"
What have I landed myself in?
So horribly out of tune
Now I'd like to hear Om saying that to me in front of everyone
"If I must, I must"
How do you feel?
I feel like a scapegoat
I welcome students from all over the country... who are participating in this finale of...
Best of Best Generation Next
Two teams have made it to the finals
The girls' team from Bangalore.
And the boys from our college
Of course I'm gonna help you.
"Well, what am I, not gonna help you?"
"I just--like I said, I can't, I gotta--"
"I can't, I got the thing."
I-I got a shift.
"Uh-huh, and what would happen to the shift if I said I wanted to fuck you tonight?"
[chuckles]
"Well, I mean... ♪♪"
Could probably get it covered.

Hi.
- [clears throat]
- What are we doing?
Diffusing the sexual tension that's ruining our friendship.
"Okay, so, you want this?"
"Well, if this is what it takes for us to become friends again, then yes, but this is a one-time offer only, okay?"
This is for you to get it out of your system.
"Well, what if I need more than one time?"
One time.
"[music continues, muffled]"
Okay.
No eye contact?
"Well, it's a tight space."
"Um, just the fumes are making me gag, so let's, like, move this along, okay?"
A little impersonal.
"Well, I'm gonna throw you a look over my shoulder every now and then like this."
"Oh, thanks."
"That's more of a ""I stole your parking space"" look than it is of, uh, arousal."
"[sighs] Well, I'll keep that in mind, try to make it better."
[chuckles]
This floor is disgusting.
[clears throat]
~ Michael's not answering his phone.
~ What happened to your face?
Have you called the RVI?
What was Scottie doing exactly the last time you saw him?
"Getting a taxi, I think."
We were all stotious.
"Jo, maybe you should go back home and wait for him to turn up there."
~ (What?
") ~ Jo, if you think Scottie's done something stupid, you should be calling the police, not standing here staring at me after 36 hours."
Something stupid?
Like what?
My phone's still not working.
Can I use yours?
"Police, please."
"This way, please."
Sir?
~ Which one's the wife?
~ Er... it's the woman in the cream coat.
Who's the other two?
"The bloke is Peter Magath, the dead man's best mate, and that's his wife, Anita."
"Aye, look."
Have you seen the state of his face?
"They don't seem especially close, do they?"
She called in saying that she was worried about her missing husband and feared for his mental state.
Her description of her husband matches our man exactly.
I'll take them down.
"No, no."
"Rachel, you take her down."
Sit with her.
Watch her face and remember everything that she says.
"Afterwards, assuming it is her husband, bring her back here and if she wants to talk, let her talk, but don't tell her anything."
"And afterwards, you bring her back here and I'll come and find you."
That was pretty good.
"- I will shoot you, Sherbert."
"- All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
"- Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff."
- No!
- Now let's me and you take a little walk.
- Ooh.
"- How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?"
Do you even have a plan?
- I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
"Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again."
- Pfft.
You're scrambling.
"- Look, I told you, we're NYPD."
"- Yeah, right."
- I can prove it.
"Look up ""Brooklyn detective attacked by birds."""
You'll see an article with a photo of me.
-Officerdown.
Allavailableunitsrespond.
"- I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake."
"My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD."
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.
- Keep walking.
- Let him go.
"- Put that gun down, or he dies."
- He's not gonna shoot me.
He needs me alive to get out of here.
"- Yeah, you willing to take that bet?"
Janeway to Voy...
Get up!
Get away from her!
Commander... any word on that tellerium?
Not yet.
How bad is it?
The antimatter reaction rate is down to 12 percent.
"If it drops below nine, the plasma injectors will lock up and we'll never be able to reinitialize the nacelles."
Options?
"If we're going to reduce our power demands even further, we're going to have to drop the shields."
I don't want to leave the ship defenseless this close to a hostile planet.
All other systems are already off-line.
Life support is at minimal.
You asked for options.
Thas our last one.
"All right, power down the shields."
That helped.
Is only a matter of time.
There's nothing more we can do without the tellerium.
Neelix to Voyager.
"Yes, Neelix."
"The rest of the away team is gone, Commander."
They've been taken by the Mokra.
What do you want me to do?
Did you get the tellerium?
"Yes, I have it."
Then we need you here.
Prepare to beam directly to Engineering.
Rerouting emergency power to Transporter Room 2.

Chakotay to away team.
"Captain, can you hear me?"
"Mother, it's 8:00."
We have a rehearsal in Tokyo today.
We know about your rehearsal.
Go right ahead.
Mother.
"You met Takehara, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
Is he doing well?
"Yes, he is."
You seem to be meeting him often.
Is there something going on?
"I had to talk to him about selling the ""Hana."""
You have to talk with him about that?
He used to rent it out.
That's kind of a strange way to do things.
Why do you have to ask him for permission?
I'm not.
"Ah, so you're not finished with him."
Is that what it is?
I have to go.
"Mother, it's funny but don't you think that there was more peace in the house during the war."
"Yes, I think so."
"Back then, everyone got along, and it wasn't like it is now with everyone going their separate ways."
Perhaps it's my fault.
We didn't worry about unnecessary things back then.
That's true.
It was because our freedom was taken away from us.
"If it hadn't been for the war, you would be in England or France dancing at a ballet school."
"Yes, that's right."
And I might have gone with you.
The war delayed my studies.
"If it hadn't been for the war, even if I had kept studying with you, I might be teaching my own children now."
Okay.
"Look, you stay out of Vegas, and we'll be fine."
"Come now, Samantha."
"If your clients are truly happy, then I pose no threat."
"But when your service is less than exemplary, like with Mr. Harpel there, who I'm sure would have met you at the appointed time... had you only picked him up yourself in a jet, as I did,"
then you become vulnerable to competition.
"Oh, see, now you don't have to teach me how to service my clients."
I happen to be the number one host in Las Vegas.
A meaningless distinction.
What?
"You might be number one at the moment, but you've never had to compete with the best."
"Now that I'm here, you won't be on top for long."
Wanna bet?
A friendly wager might be in order.
Hmm.
What do you propose?
I bet that I can bring in more money than you can in the next 24 hours.
"And we'll even do it on your home turf, the Montecito."
Nice.
And the winner would say that she...
Or he.
Would be Vegas's best.
Why don't we make it interesting?
Please.
"Winner gets bragging rights, loser leaves town."
Deal?
Deal.
[Chattering]
Hey.
Is that the infamous Paul Logan I see at blackjack 22?
Yep.
He seems so...
"I should have died, but you..."
"You didn't want to be alone, and that's what all this boils down to."
You can't stand the thought of being alone.
All right.
I'll give you this much.
You are certainly willing to do the sacrificing as long as you're not the one being hurt.
"All right, you want to be honest?"
"If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing."
"No, Dean."
I wouldn't.
Same circumstances...
I wouldn't.
I'm gonna get to bed.

What about it?
I was with Vinnie Zapatti last night.
He's dead because of Tino Zapatti's probation report.
Now there's four deaths.
They're connected.

- Right.
"- Goodbye, beautiful."
"Oh, miss, tell Mr. Mason if there's anything my wife needs-  you understand."
"- No, I'm afraid I don't."
"Well, there must be a bill at least."
Tell him whatever is necessary to help-- anything--
I'll be glad to manage somehow.
- All--
- I have a little money saved.
"All right, Mr. Potkin, you've positively identified the Sandover car."
You say it came from the cottage and went past you as you were working on your truck in the dark.
"Nearly ran me down, you mean."
Of course I was parked on the only road out.
Yeah.
You heard the written confession of the defendant's husband introduced earlier by the prosecution in order to clarify their case.
You heard Mr. Sandover's statement that he drove that same car
- out to that same cottage.
Not really.
I'm sort of all right as I am.
"Please, Will."
"What does that mean? ""Please"" what?"
Look at yourself.
You're 38 and you've never had a job or a relationship that lasted longer than two months.
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.
"I mean, I would say you were a disaster."
"I mean, what is the point of your life?"
Bloody hell.
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life but thank you for bringing it up.
The reason we wanted you to come here today was we wanted to ask you how would you like to be Imogene's godfather?
Seriously?
Seriously.
"Listen, I'm really, really touched."
But you must be joking.
I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene.
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice."
"We know, I just thought you had hidden depths."
No.
No.
You've always had that wrong.
I really am this shallow.
Here we are.
"You know you don't have to walk me to school anymore now, Mum."
I know the way now.
But what if I like walking you to school?
Right.
"- No, I canceled."

Why don't you make that pasta with the artichokes?

Want to know what I'm wearing?
Just wearing a towel.

That way I can slosh my way through my twilight years.
Bob?
I hope I went peacefully
"Sorry, Emily."
I didn't know you were awake.
Bob?
What are you doing?
"Oh, I... couldn't go to sleep, so I thought I'd weigh myself."
"Well, how much did you lose?"
I'm afraid I'm like the stock market.
I'm up an eighth.
"Emily, this diet isn't working."
"Well, Bob, you've gotta give it a chance."
You've only been on it five hours.
"Emily, I gained an eighth of a pound in five hours."
"Well, that's all the water you've been drinking."
I can't understand it.
"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
"Well, I wanted to look pretty for you, Bob."
I was... trying on nightgowns and primping.
"I mean, after all, Bob, it was a special occasion."
"You do remember, don't you, sweetheart?"
I've got to stop my stomach from growling.
Maybe I'll have some celery.
What about sleep?
How many hours of sleep do you get?
Do you sleep soundly?
"No, not really, I can't get a good night's sleep."
And it takes a while for me to fall asleep.
What about your appetite?
"I don't really crave anything, but I do eat."
"On a scale of one to ten, where would you rank your migraine?"
At its most painful.
I wonder...
"I'm not really sure, around a six or seven?"
It's difficult to endure without medicine.
And its frequency?
How many times does it occur in a week?
Three days?
Four?
"Once it starts, it lasts the whole day."
"When you take your medicine, does the pain subside?"
"Not completely, but yes."
What year is it right now?
Do I have Alzheimer's?
"Or am I in the process, and have a mild cognitive impairment?"
You've done a lot of research.
"I searched on the internet,"
I was worried.
"Yes, well first, please answer these questions and make notes often."
What day is it today?
Wednesday.
Seventy-seven plus twelve is what?
Eighty-eight.
"No, nine, eighty-nine."
Please count backwards from that number.
And I'm actually the oldest.
It's pretty safe to say that Jill's obsession with aging and getting married in due time started back in Catholic school and specifically our first communion.
We got to walk down the isle like mini brides to be.
Comparing prettiest dresses...
and fanciest bows.
This is where Jill got programmed to plan for the next time... she would walk down the aisle...
dressed in white.
You are getting married
A little toy here or there never hurt anyone.
Plus it comes with a carrying case.
Oh!
That is such an inappropriate gift.
What you're saying you don't masturbate?
No personally I don't masturbate.
I find it to be a little bit... un-holy.
Wouldn't you agree?
Jillian thank you I love this!
Dale have you talked to JP?
No.
I mean he called twice but...
"Hey, I heard you saw Zach."
Oh yeah.
I saw his video on TV the other day he looks so good.
Did you guys make plans to hang out?
No we just caught up for a second.
He was with a girlfriend.
Hmmm...
Ok what is up?
What?
You look like either have to pee or you're about to explode with gossip.
Do I?
- Which is it?
There are many such interesting and sensational cases.
"Now that we know each other, I'll tell you about it in leisure."
What are you doing tomorrow evening?
Nothing.
Why do you ask?
- l have some work with your father.
A good reason to meet you too.
No place for reasons.
You can drop in at any time.
"I must leave now, Miss Sheetal."
So early?
- Even I have to work for a living.
"And this fool had to drop in now, you see."
Bye!
"Sheetal, meet Vijay."
And she is my daughter Sheetal.
"My dear, he is a daredevil police officer."
I see?
"So, he is a police officer?"
"I don't understand one thing, daddy."
The crime is on the rise day by day.
What does the police do about it?
"Mr Sahney, our police force and the C.l.D has set an example for the world."
"But, this fact is known only by few educated people like you and me."
Fools and illiterate people just ty to find flaws in it.
But we must not take them seriously.
What do you think?
"Am I not right, Miss Sheetal?"
Perhaps.
"But Daddy, if our police force is so effective then why doesn't crime cease?"
"Mr Sahney, if not cease, crime can be reduced."
But the people must also understand its responsibilities.
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, ya big crazy."
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers... but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see."
And I see her brighter and more clearly... than anything else in this world.
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed... with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
Stay back or I'll shoot him!
"Appreciate what you're trying to do, son."
"Did the same job myself, and proudly."
"I have no quarrel with you, but I do have a deadline."
So put the gun down..
Pull the pin.
Because you're not gonna shoot the president.
You're right.
"Where does that leave us, boys?"
That leaves us with this.
Come on!
"Go, go, go!"
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, no."
"Come on, go!"
"Thank you for calling, sir."
"Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away."
"Glory be, commissioner."
What's wrong?
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank has just been robbed.
- By Batman and Robin.
-Saints preserve us.
"Yes, indeed, saints preserve us if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked."
Which apparently they have.
Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed that this happened.
"Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units for the arrest of Batman."
"Hopefully alive, but we'll take him the other way if we have to."
Attention all units.
Be on alert for Batman.
First name unknown.
Caucasian.
"Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks, purple cape, purple cowl and a black bat insignia on his chest."
He has a masked accomplice whose alias is Robin.
Approach with caution.
They may be armed.
"I hate to do it, Caped Crusader, but I have to take you in."
You're on the wanted list.
"My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader."
Don't make me use it.
"Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper?"
Go on and shoot.
I dare you.
"What's happened to you, Boy Wonder?"
Even your voice has turned snarly.
"None of your business, Flatfoot."
"Now, go ahead and shoot, because you'll never take us alive."
"Batman, I'm giving you three to get out of the car with your hands up."
Eric sure is taking an awfully long time with those sodas.
[Laughing]
"I'm sure it's no reflection on you, Lance."
He probably just wants to make sure a good friend like you... gets the freshest soda available.
"I know Eric doesn't like me, Mrs. Forman."
I only came over for the chance to see my beautiful Donna.
And after I make my fortune in robots...
"I'm gonna come back to this Podunk town and buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at... fire him, and make Donna my wife."
You're a creepy kid.
You know that?
"Mrs. Forman, I think we both know the real reason you invited me over here."
"You're after Mother's coveted peach cobbler recipe, no?"
Your mom makes peach cobbler?
I had no idea.
"Please, let's speak frankly."
"I have something you want, and you have something I want."
W-We're not in a- in a position to just give you Donna.
We could give you Eric.
Mother tasted your stuffing at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot... and ever since then she's wanted the recipe.
I've been instructed to arrange a swap.
Don't you have any weird friends to play with?
Friends are for the weak.
"Okay, you guys."
MeetJulie.
"She's got two horses, a brand-new Firebird... and her dad works for Six Flags!"
"[All] Hello, Julie!"
"Hey, Hyde."
Love your hair.
You can touch it if you want.
"Oh, get lost, skankoid."
We're all full.
"Damn, Jackie!"
No!
You fucking roadkill.
Who... who kept wide eyes... when she jaws?
What?
We're on a deadline and there's a shortage of interns.
Bullshit.
I have appointments and I need someone to carry my Polaroid.
"- But we need her, darling."
- Get Foofy.
- I don't know where Foofy is.
- Filing cards for upcoming shoots.
You know we only use 5 models anyway.
Are you an idiot?
No!
So don't act like one.
So here is the trick for getting free stuff:
"You call Louis Vuitton, call in 4 bags and send back 3."
"The next day, call in 2 and send back 1..."
Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up... this luggage you delay and tell them it's on a shoot in Barbados.
"Until you find somebody over there quit, which is weekly."
And say you just sent it back to Sheila and fake surprise... when they say she left the company.
- No way.
- Lf they keep questioning you... tell them you messengered it over to Vogue.
An editor requested it.
- That's hilarious!
- Works every time.
"Hello, Louis V."
This soup is delicious.
It beats throwing an acceptable layout away.
It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey... is insane.
That the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately?
It's a start.
"Before the war, I served under a general."
We traveled a great deal.
We were in budapest when I met anna.
She worked in a hotel tailor shop...
Sold me the most beautiful tie.
"And then the war broke out, and things became..."
Difficult.
She was jewish.
"Still is, I'm happy to say."
"The general carried several letters of transit in his safe,"
"Any one of which would have ensured her safety,"
But he refused to sign.
You forged his name.
Hence the dishonorable discharge.
It was filing the papers that sunk me.
I was arrested in the middle of whitehall.
Hmm.
On a Tuesday.
How did anna get out?
The same way I avoided the noose.
Howard?
"Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general,"
And he and I had always got along.
"When he heard of my predicament, he..."
Used his influence.
Sounds like a story.
"Another time, perhaps."
"Anna obviously knows what howard did for you,"
But she doesn't know what you do for him?
"Not recently, no."
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It might be best to have a man with experience.
Someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 1 2 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
You keep struggling through the years.
Then a day comes and you find yourself locked outside the door.
Thank you!
Sorry for the trouble.
"You know, Mert has been in school for a long time and he still hasn't graduated."
"Do you, or his father, ever talk to him about this matter?"
He doesn't have a father.
We're separated.
"No matter how much you care, guys are guys."
Aren't they all the same?
"One day, he just left us..."
Mert was 11 years old when he left.
Didn't he ever call his son after that?
Never.
We started a life with Mert.
Just like a friend...
"Look at Mrs. Guler, she's never had a happy day."
"Just when she brought her son up, this is what happened."
"Having a mother like you, why did Mert turn out to be like this?"
Mert isn't the child you think he is.
He just wanted to work.
He said the streets are filled with unemployed people and wanted to start... earning money as soon as possible.
Does he work?
Yes.
"But he's studying really hard now, he's back in school."
He'll enter the selection exam too.
He doesn't want to hurt me anymore.
I think my illness played a big role in that.
What did the doctors say?
I hope it's nothing serious?
"The doctors have said she'd be alright, but..."
I have cancer.
You just missed out on the night of your life.
(PANTING) The night of your life.
I've been in love with her for five years.
I've been in love with her for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.
"Hey, maybe you can't dunk anymore, but you've achieved more in your 30 years than that 15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of."
You put yourself through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And you married a smoking-hot chick who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you an entire foot closer to dunking.
"There you go, Vanilla Thunder."
Step back.
(MARSHALL SCREAMING)
"Oh, baby."
"How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office, and you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?"
MARSHALL:
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?
"Sure, baby."
- She loves me!
- But I chose her!
Guys!
Guys!
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.
"Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there, that window's gonna open up again in, like, 10 minutes."
"- Wait, where's Maggie?"
- She's gone.
- What?
- I sent her home.
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.
Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!
You can ask him yourself
But he is blind!
What?
Blind?
He told your fortune in darkness?
I think you should get into your room first
I'll get money from Master to get you medicine
"Hey, Gao!"
What?
Jin Tianyun is dead?
"Y es, I heard he was killed by the Three Devils"
These Three Devils are pure evils
Ever since they killed him their morale is boosted
Don't know why they have stayed here the past few months?
"What's more, a few days ago they have beaten up"
Master Qin's apprentices for no reason at all!
Nonsense!
If they keep on causing trouble
I'll teach them a good lesson!
That's why we are here
We hope you could ensure that justice is done
Y es!
The three of them are very skillful
"Master, what should we do?"
Should we hire some more men to help?
In order to eradicate these kind of dregs
Maybe it's good to have some more men
Do you know where the three of them... used to stay?
"We're not sure about that, but we've heard..."
Zhou Sanzhao spent all the money he'd robbed at Yihong Brothel.
He went there every night
The money was spent fast as flowing water!
Mr. Lin?
Come in.
"Mr. Lin, your brother and his girlfriend were killed at the beach car park on Sept 3."
We suspect they fought back and were killed.
We found a metal ruler at the crime scene.
We matched the prints on the ruler to a Lo Keung
We shouldn't show you these but you were once a brilliant cop in China.
We hope... you understand.
"You can provide us more info and facts, then we can solve this case."
"I remember he has a diamond watch and a belt,"
a wallet with a photo of us.
Well done!
The whole HK knows.
I've never seen so many letters of praise but there're just as many complain letters.
They're all yours!
Tell me.
Why all this for a small robber?
You caused major road chaos in Central.
So who is going to back you up next time?
"Sir, a small robber is still a robber."
We shouldn't discount them.
"Also, there were hostages to protect."
Who do you think you are?
Superhero?
No one likes you in the whole station!
"I don't care, I just want to do my job."
I don't care.
This is the police.
We've rules to follow.
"If not for your father asking his friends to call the Chief, you'd have been fired."
Get lost and be your rich playboy!
Get out!
Sorry.
Bad joke.
It's just a laugh riot around here.
This all looks really good.
"Yeah, it's too bad you're leaving."
We never eat like this.
That's not true.
I cook all the time.
Dad...
"I'm sorry, honey."
Let's just eat.
We're not saying we want you to cook more.
"Hell, no."
You remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
That was brisket.
"Yeah, that's my point exactly."
"As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms."
They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or a guardian available.
So I'm now property of the government.
Nickname: 0382965.
"Hey, it's better than death-breath Seth."
Or so I would imagine.
"So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning, and she'll be the one to, uh... to take you to the group home."
"My contact at Child Services got you a room with only two other kids, which is good, because it can get crowded."
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
"And, you know, they do find foster homes for kids your age."
"Yeah, because everybody wants a brand-new teenager."
I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that'll state the obvious...
Seth.
"But we have all this extra room, right?"
We have a pool house.
Educational.
I left to escape my foes here and to confront another foe on the field of battle.
But I realized that my only true enemy had accompanied me all the way.
Who was that?
"Welcome home, brother."
You've changed.
Though I cannot yet see how.
You soon will.
How is your wife?
"Oh, you know her."
Bouncing through life.
"Well, that was fun!"
"Can't possibly see the King now, unless he likes being vomited upon."
You must see a doctor.
Tell His Highness to come immediately.
That's really not necessary.
I'm certain it was the pastries I had last night.
"Your Highness, you must see a doctor, given all that's happened of late."
"Oh, I see."
"Yes, perhaps, you should call for a doctor."
An invitation from the King.
An invitation from the King.
You must send a message to my dressmaker and the Monseur Cornereau in Paris.
Tell them they must come to the palace immediately.
Monsieur Cornereau?
"He makes fireworks, you idiot!"
"Queen of Versailles, that's what he called me, and I'm going to show him how Queens welcome home their Kings."
"This is most heartening news, Sire!"
I was deaf to your advice.
I shall not be again.
Even the Lord Jesus was lost in the widerness.
"In three weeks, we shalll celebrate Easter, Sire."
Now this truck contains somethin' in addition to just cologne.
- Somethin' like what?
- A bag full of money.
"The weird part, is the guy called us up... and had the stones to taunt us after he did what he did."
- Stones...
- Or some kind of a death wish.
Cos he all gave us his address.
"His name and number, was clear as day the whole time he was fuckin' with us."
Culpepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She's checked him out.
"Says he leaves in the morning, comes back in the afternoon."
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord's on our team, so the door will be open."
- Better be.
"- Relax, the door will be open."
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
- Why not?
- The building's almost empty.
Switching over the condos or some kinda gentrificational kind of shit.
"You sure this guy was working alone, Russ?"
Pretty sure!
Landlord said the guy's a loner.
This happens tomorrow.
- Can you handle it?
- 'Course we can handle it.
You got the specs?
Now we good?
"Yeah, we good."
"Come on, Daze."
Hey you guys hear about Barbie Sunday's new dress?
- Yea we know.
Anything I desire eh?
We'll come later
We just wanted to stop by
Good bye
What's he doing here?
"I'll find out right away, your Majesty"
"Whatever he is here for, I don't want to see him here again"
Aye aye
Why are you here?
Paşa your Lordship
I came here to see princess
When wil she be released?
Whenever his Majesty wants
Maybe ever
But my Paşa...
It is very serious.
There would be a big conflict
Let it happen
Then we would see how serious it is
Additionally
Don't come here ever again
"If you want to say something, visit me"
What is this?
"Mumbar Dolması, Stuffed sheep sausages"
Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness
Our Sultan is here
How are you today Signora Isabella?
Translate exactly what she said
I'm happy as never before
How couldn't I be?
I'm away from my palace and family
I'm captured by the barbarians
"You know, the passports were a gift from me."
"Least you could do is cover my shift, you rat bastard."
Thought you were gonna ask carter.
I was.
I did.
She acted like I was waving a sock in front of her face.
I'm sure you were polite and respectful as always.
"You sweet on her, sousa?"
Don't you have enough women in your life to worry about?
"All right, I'm gonna give you"
"A nickel's worth of free advice, pal."
"No girl's gonna trade in a red, white, and blue shield"
For an aluminum crutch.
Your knowledge of waste removal rather surprises me.
I spent a week down here in the winter of '42.
It was...
"another time, perhaps."
"After all, we all have secrets."
I was wrong.
I need to know.
Miss carter...
"If we're going to be working together,"
"Risking our lives together,"
Then I must be able to trust you.
"On my honor, you can."
Your honor is not enough.
Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust.
I would hope that would suffice.
Mr. Stark would trust a shark to not bite him
If it was wearing a short enough skirt.
That's not entirely relevant.
Would it satisfy you to know
What do I know?
They...
They are very...
- Are you ill?
- No.
I only wish to lie down for a minute.
I have a room just to the side where you can relax.
"It's all right, everyone."
She's going to be all right.
- What do you suppose is wrong?
- She's probably pregnant again.
There's George.
Excuse me.
I have no desire to speak to that woman.
Chopinsky!
You hiding from George too?
You would know the reason.
I don't want to spoil a good drunken stupor by imagining your reason.
"Ever since the latest chapter of her egregious memoir was published,"
I can hardly show my face anywhere.
Did you read her latest novel?
"It's not literature, it's drainage."
She only wrote good books when she was with me.
Every morning while she was sleeping I'd cross out half her adjectives.
Hercules could not have done it.
He'd have rather cleaned out the bloody stables.
Know what's funny?
- She doesn't come.
- Oh.
"She makes a lot of pretty noise, but she can't come."
Like her books...
lovesick posturing and pretence for quick money.
Do you have any idea why he left?
I'm not sure.
I'd only be guessing.
You hesitated.
Why?
I don't know.
You know what he did during that year and a half?
"He was in the Navy, he said."
"Do you imply that he came home from the war, from combat duty just to beat you up?"
"-We object, your Honor!"
The defendant has implied no such thing.
-Sustained.
-Did your stepfather... own the house you live in?
-My brother and I fixed it up.
"-Answer the question, please."
-It wasn't a house when...
"-Please, answer the question."
Yes.
"But it was a dirty shack, and nothing else!"
"But you had the freedom to come and go, and... invite boys in... and answer to no one while Lucas was gone, didn't you?"
"Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!"
"When you thought he was going to change all that, did you kill him?"
No!
Lucas was drunk and tried to beat me!
"The coroner testified... that Lucas was unconscious from the first or second blow... so you'd say you'd end the beating then, but you didn't stop."
Why?
I don't know.
You kept beating him until you crushed life out of him.
Why?
I don't know!
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
"We boys go, but girls go as well, but it's the first time that..."
"Marcel, you never laugh."
I never laugh?
"You don't know... I don't know you, but it seemed to me... I laugh so much that I've paid for it."
Why?
Some teachers don't like it.
"Even so, you seemed sad to me."
I'm like that too. I find it hard to get to know people.
One for six.
"- For how much have you, please?"
"- For seven, six and five."
"- Two for six, please."
- They're sold out for today.
Then for seven.
They're all sold out.
Couldn't you manage it somehow?
Those two for six.
"I promised the teacher, but I came late."
"Wait here, I'm just going to get out of playing the trombone."
"Don't show yourself much near the cinema, mum teaches here, I've got tickets, we'll pop off to that cinema."
You're going to play the trombone now?
You enjoy playing?
"I took it up, it was for free, I could play."
Have you performed anywhere?
"On May Day, we gave a concert in a village."
So I'm going to get it over and done with.
"All right, I'll wait for you."
Careful!
"The same melody is repeated half way through, but the first time it's piano, and the second time...?"
- Mezzo-forte.
- And which is louder?
Mezzo-forte.
He appeared before me first time I presided over the moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
Is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge and you're sitting here rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, Captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry...
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
"Please, you know this is the last thing I wanted to do."
Then get the hell out of Internal Affairs and get yourself an honest job.
"Last month, I had to lay him off, two weeks shy of retirement."
Lawrence did not take it well.
What the hell was that?
"Doc, I don't have all year to figure this out."
I told you I needed to study Wickes.
You just watched him for two hours.
Yes.
And then you blocked my view at the critical moment.
"First mention of AUTEC, all I saw was the back of your big fat head."
I can't even confirm now that he was involved in the blackmail.
Looks like Ridgeway might be.
"Oh, you think Wickes was rattled enough to give up a partner just like that?"
"Or he's just telling us what he knows, and he's innocent."
I didn't try to block your view.
I didn't try to ruin anything.
That's it?
Is that all you have to say?
No.
Lawrence Ridgeway.
TONY:
Say hello to Lawrence Ridgeway.
"A spry 62, and loving it."
"Third-generation steelworker, hired at Wickes Steel when he was just a kid."
"Dedicated employee, sort of like yours truly."
"By the way,"
I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in the SECNAV op.
Thank the Doc.
She's the one who chose you.
"Yeah, I thought your game show host quality would be good for the stage."
Ziva?
ZIVA:
Ridgeway has had a rough year.
- Just the AV guys again.
"DC Sonic, they're replacing the surround system in the theatre."
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...
She's coming back tonight?
"Carol, is she coming back tonight?"
"Yes, sir."
Wheels down at 1845.
"Yes, of course."
"As many of you are well-aware, this is my last week here so I wanna make this clear to everybody:"
If there are any congratulatory cakes or any of that nonsense I will be compelled to use deadly force.
I hate you.
I hate you all.
Thank you.
No incendiaries in the White House.
"All right, baby, I just gotta get my weapon real quick."
"You're gonna have to sign out, sir."
Hello.
You guys here for the tour?
Do you think we can see where you'll be working?
"- Yeah, sure."
- Great.
"Gather around, everyone, gather around."
My name is Donnie and I'll be your guide today as we take a walk through American history.
"I wanna give you all a warm Washington, D.C. welcome to the White House where each year we get millions of guests from every corner of the globe."
Where are you folks from?
"Washington, D.C."
- Bad choice.
"What about you, ma'am?"
- Nebraska.
What brings you to the White House?
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
You know that?
What?
"What, babe, what's going on in that crazy head of yours?"
"I really want this to work, Stevie."
But?
You know so little about me.
What if I turned into a werewolf or something?
I'll buy you a flea collar.
I love you.
- Stevie?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"I set out some clean clothes for you, your stuff is not dry yet."
You always keep men's clothes lying around?
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep a clean change clothes here.
"I'll probably just throw them out now though, right?"
"Hey, perfect fit."
"Yeah, well, Trevor..."
I don't have a size 26 waist here.
"Hey, how about that idea."
I can get a job selling man's wear.
Those chicks got paid vacations too.
I'll settle for that.
That's not a bad life.
Could be worse.
You know what else I want to do?
"I want to clean up this place, just get rid of all the fucking junk."
"Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper, which I sometimes am... but I can also be very very, you know, organised and neat."
And I wanna do more of that.
I would love to paint a place.
"Just make it nice, just be organised, and neat and paint it white."
Thanks
Remember you can visit as often as you like.
"Its not that far, and i can come get you."
"No choice, We could sink the whole shit out on the coast!"
-Not according to the brits.
-I dont believe them.
-Well tell them
-Thats what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way"
With taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is onboard.
The ferry left several minutes ago.
-You wanted the ferry plan all along.
-Thats not true.
"Off course, done with it all..."
So you finally can get back to Norway
"-Two coffes, what do you want?"
-Juice
-Good morning.
-39 barrels sunk.
-18 dead.
-Minus 4 germans
"Most of them under deck, likely captured in the dark, if the explotion didnt get them."
"One man got crushed on deck, by some rail carriages- 138 00:25:43.200 -- 00:25:46.299 - when he tried to get the lifeboat out."
"Most of them ended up in the sea, and drowned."
"Only the starboard lifeboat got used, And that one could only hold 8."
"Well, the main office is very pleased."
"They see ""heavy water"" operation as an success."
"""an example on warfare with few casualities"""
"""Such gives us great advanteges in battle"""
Churchill sends his congratulations.
- What did Mr. Somers say to that?
"Told me to help myself, that they'd all be looking for a job next morning."
I told him that Axel would blow his top.
"I think that'll be all, sir."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Just where at the Somers factory did this conversation take place?
"Well, it was in the parking lot that I ran into him, actually."
You share a common parking lot with Somers' factory?
"No, no, of course not."
Then how did you know you'd be able to reach him there?
I called him at his office.
They said he'd be leaving.
- You called from where?
- From my home.
"- Really, I don't see--"
- You went home and then you decided?
"No, no, I'd gone home for an early bite because I knew I had to come back to the office that evening."
It was on my way.
"Really, Your Honor, I don't see--"
"May it please the court, I ask permission at this time to recall a witness."
"Yes, Axel told me to put in calls long distance-- one for you and one for Mr. Hadley."
"The call to Mr. Hadley, what time was that?"
Right after you hung up.
About 8?
8:30?
Was the call completed?
No.
"The phone rang and rang, but no answer."
All right.
So I drove up to the Valley.
It was there at the motel that I spoke to Somers.
The baseball spring training for his Mets.
That Bill's a lucky man.
"You Russians, you got all the angles, you come over here, you bust your ass."
People are people.
Look at you.
You got every excuse to be in the bottle... and here you are designing websites.
What do you mean?
What excuse?
-Your--
"-No, what?"
"Come on, you know, that--"
My leg.
Of course.
I don't think of it right away.
There are worse things.
...digital countdown timer with automatic shut-off.
"Simply put your food in and set the timer, walk away."
Your new George Foreman Grill will tell you exactly... when your food is grilled to perfection.
This grill does all the work for you.
With my exclusive 20-minute digital countdown timer with auto....
"Heroin, you got only one option."
"A dog you love catches rabies, you put her out of its misery, Anthony."
Salute.
"So what do I do, Uncle Jun'?"
"The feds get him in his condition, who knows what he's liable to say."
"You go on trial, like me, you won't sleep at night."
All the more reason to clean him up.
"Still, he's...."
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else....
It reminds me of people's feet.
I don't know if I can do that other thing.
"Andres did not agree, but I insisted."
I had to know.
what madness!
"In any case, it has helped, I am now covinced it was not his imagination, he was telling the truth."
It seems his madness is contagious.
"We will soon know if its truly madness, Ricardo."
Tomorrow we will dive again.
I do not want to have a single doubt.
I will go along.
What your are doing makes no sense.
Go on holiday and forget about all this.
You would like to see me in an insane asylum.
I am not insane.
"And if you have come for that, you could have spared yourself the trip."
You are wasting our time.
Is it that you don't realize that you're risking angelica's life?
So...
That's what it is?
I hope nothing happens to her.
I doubt you will overcome this madness anytime soon.
Can you tell me why you tossed the tank and the harpoon?
"Protection, in case..."
In case of necessity.
I understand.
Andres...
"God Dammit, I don't like this."
"Here, take this."
"What is it that you are doing, Andres?"
I have to help Angelica.
Don't move.
"And you, drop that gun."
"Once again we meet,eh."
"This is in Corsica, it's a man whom I loved very much."
I photographed him in a field...
Which he owned in a certain way...
It's land that...
That was his heritage from his uncle in Corsica.
It's a picture taken 5 or 6 years ago.
I particularly like the sun in the tree over here.
"And this man, standing straight in front of the tree."
I took it because that's kind of his empire.
"When seeing him there, I told myself that..."
"That this land is his own, and he's standing there..."
"I've always envied that - people who have a land, a place..."
A belonging.
I've never had that...
"I also loved him for this, actually..."
Therefore it's a sentimental picture.
"That's why you took it, because he was there..."
"Well no, there's no real explanation for this..."
It's just a sentimental picture...
All pictures are sentimental.
What do you think about it?
I don't know.
You never know.
Never mind.
It's in London.
That's more recent.
It's in a pub in London.
"In the day, we were having lunch."
A very British pub.
I really like pubs.
Their... sort of darkness...
At that time I didn't photograph myself yet...
"I will sit here, but I am not supposed to be anywhere near this woman."
Why?
I've taken out a restraining order on her because she will not leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
"It's phone calls, it's faxes, it's emails."
You have got to get it in your head it is never going to happen!
APPLAUSE
"If she promises not to bother you, will you join us?"
Don't touch me!
I won't.
"Now, I have to ask you..."
"Sarah, Sarah..."
Let's not involve the authorities.
You're winding me up.
Whoa!
The first thing I have to ask you is what's in your bag?
"Well, in the bag tonight, I've got all sorts of rubbish."
I've got...
I've got this which is me.
So you don't get recognised?
"I just bung it on people's faces like that, then I've got some idea of what it's like to talk to me."
LAUGHTER It's good fun.
"Now then, I know you through Vic and Bob."
Yes.
How are they?
I don't know.
I don't see them.
We do not socialise outside of the show because I have not forgiven them for tricking me into doing it in the first place.
How have you been celebrating Christmas?
What would be a typical Christmas for you?
I would celebrate Christmas usually with me family.
With me mum and me dad and me four brothers -
"I'm starving, too."
There's probably something in here.
Karen's ziti?
It's the last one she made.
And it was like 300 degrees in that Minnie Mouse head?
"So I took it off, you know?"
I was gonna have a cigarette.
- And some kid took a picture of me.
"- Come on, girls."
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.
"Look, Carmine."
You basically know what's going on with your dad and Johnny... and us over in Jersey.
"First let me say, I understand."
I appreciate the respect you're showing me by coming here... and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.
I will also go on record as saying...
I know my old man can be a tough nut to crack.
"I don't want to crack nuts, but I will."
I feel the anger.
"When I try, for the second time... on a separate issue entirely, to reach an accommodation... and he don't even make a counteroffer, where's his respect?"
I don't know what kind of advice he's getting from Johnny.
Johnny's always usually a voice of moderation.
"Me and him, we get along good."
"So, all due respect, let's not jump in and blame Johnny."
True.
John's a pragmatist.
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.
"If the d.A. Finds out ann dated him,"
He'll use it to make ann look like a prostitute.
Don't worry about al stirling.
I'll take care of him.
"I said we'd get paid for this case,didn't i?"
"Alden, handle the physical evidence."
See if the knife wounds are consistent with self-Defense.
I'd rather work with ann.
Her testimony will be our whole case.
"No,do the scientific evidence."
You do that better than anybody.
"Besides, you think she's a hooker."
"No,i don't,ron."
I've seen her place.
I think she's just a college girl that goes out
"With rich men so she doesn't feel like a loser... and she's hiding a gawky past, which i understand."
I've been that.
Okay.
Let alden take ann.
I'll take the physical stuff.
Ann's parents are coming in from nebraska.
I hate the families.
You handle 'em.
I'm going to see al.
"That was nice, him pardoning you,al."
"Well,if you'd handled my tax case,"
I wouldn't have been convicted.
"I told you, ""stop stealing from people."
"But if you're going to steal, pay your taxes."""
"It was free advice, but did you listen?"
So you know ann diggs.
I took her to some laker games.
-Like what?
Speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
"Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon."
She says she's the devil himself.
If you've seen as many psychotics as I have you'd realize that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind.
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
-No.
-Did you know my mother died recently?
"-Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
-No.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
Hello?
"- Here, take it and just don't...."
Just start looking.
Will you guys listen to yourselves?
All right.
"Come on out, Mr."
"I know you're fucking in here in the walls or something, laughing your ass off!"
The jig's up!
"Come on out, asshole!"
WOMAN:
I don't think he's going to answer.
Why?
"""November 27."
Results today:
Positive function.
The machine continues to work perfectly.
"However, I've seen something in the future that is disturbing to my core."
I believe I've seen my death.
I know the cardinal rule of time and causality... is that one should not attempt to change the future.
"But under these circumstances, it seems to be a risk worth taking."
"If I believed in God,"
"I would pray today that no greater harm will come from what I'm about to do."""
Then what?
Nothing.
"That's the last entry, a week ago today."
A week ago.
Seven photos.
That means it was kicking it out after he disappeared.
So it must be on a timer.
8200 PM.
Then why are there so many daytime ones?
Maybe it's only been taking ones at night for the last week.
All right.
Even I have to admit this photo is a little fucking unsettling.
"Well, too bad."
"We need data to fight ""Exceptions,"""
so quit complaining!
"""Exceptions""?"
What's that?
Remember it's the general term for all enemies from space?
Whatever...
"They're just a bunch of space robot monsters, right?"
"Oh, you..."
Who cares?
What I wanna know is why I'm out here alone!
?
Where's Kuya?
What's he doing?
Flail and Burst are currently getting a tune-up.
"It wouldn't have killed them to come up with a more creative new weapon, you know."
Tell that to the Development Department.
Who?
I've never been there nor met anyone from there!
Neither have I. It's a highly confidential department.
I hear only the Commander and Vice Commander have come in direct contact with them.
"If they can't trust us, who can they trust?"
All clear.
This just in from Slain.
It's currently flying 200 km off the waters of Futagami Island.
"Visibility is poor, but nothing is being picked up on the sensor."
"Eyeball sensors No. 12 to 29, no movement detected."
"Sorry, I'm late."
Be careful now.
Yes.
Just as I thought...
There are too many factors that cannot be analyzed.
Keep it to yourself till you die.
For me.
Should I not say it?
What's wrong?
It's no crime to date them...
Changwook will not take this well.
- Did you date them?
- Yes.
How many?
I've had maybe two or three serious ones.
- That's quite a lot.
- I told you not to say anything!
I was lonely.
"Yeah, they love Asian women."
They just go crazy about them.
Even if the women are ugly.
It's not necessarily like that.
But there's a premium if they go there.
Not many Asian women in Europe.
Western men have a fantasy about them.
Many Korean men seem to think so.
"Frankly, it's rather a disgrace."
Unpopular women here are considered pretty over there.
Don't you think it's a disgrace?
"Well, that's not how I feel."
Look here.
It's a person meeting another.
It's not like what you said.
"Oh, you might think that I have an inferiority complex about my dick size compared to Western men, but that's not it."
"You have to live where you were born, whether you're ugly or not."
Why do unpopular girls here go over there to live comfortably?
That's really not cool!
I think Roman is pulling some kind of stunt.
What're you talking about?
"Well, he just tore out of here in his car and he took all his stuff with him."
"Ryan, you know he's not allowed to leave the state."
"Alright, I'm coming back."
They both suffered total cardiac arrest.
Paramedics revived them on their way in but there were no signs of cognitive response from either one.
- We're assessing...
- Which one is my husband?
Can he hear me?
It's possible.
We really can't tell at this stage.
"""Casey"""
Do you want a chair?
"No, I'm not gonna stay long."
Not sure if he'd want me to.
I'm sure he appreciates it.
"Anything happens, you'll let me know?"
Either way.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Just like he said.
Mrs. Bryson?
Can we speak for a moment?
We can keep your husband on the machine so long as there is lower brain function.
And we will keep monitoring but...
It's been three weeks now.
What are you saying?
The chances of him waking are very small.
Like what?
There's no way of telling.
It could be months.
They mustn't get away.
"Come on, we must get to the other side."
Step on the gas!
"Ah, yes, thank you."
I'm glad I can show you our problems on the spot.
- We've just received this radio message.
"- OK, thank you."
"Gentlemen, perhaps we should propose a toast to our president Ramírez."
May our relations always remain as positive as they have been thus far.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thank you.
...images of the plane that was shot down as it was approaching the runway.
"There were 185 children aboard the plane, who were on their way home."
Both the children and the crew died.
Enrique Carrasco is held responsible for the attack.
He was seen at the airport at the time of the attack.
/t seems certain that he committed this inhuman crime...
- What do you think about this?
- We didn't catch Carrasco.
He escaped.
No one who has seen these images will help him.
He's finished.
- It's got stuck in the tree.
"- Come on, let's climb up."
- I've got it!
I've got it!
- Come down and show it to us.
Show it to us.
What does it say on this piece of paper?
Nothing important.
They're asking the guerrilleros to surrender.
"Any problems, he goes to Paulie."
"Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie."
"Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy he can call Paulie."
But now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week no matter what.
"""Business is bad?"
"Fuck you, pay me."
"Oh, you had a fire?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"""The place got hit by lightning, huh?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"Also, Paulie could do anything."
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
"And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount."
Take a $200 case of booze and you sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
"And then finally, when there's nothing left when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze you bust the joint out."
You light a match.
Do you need any help reaching anything?
"You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree, ya fuckin' prick."
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
Who?
"The Jew broad, Diane."
I was tellin' you about inside.
"I been trying to bang this broad for a fuckin' month, now."
"The only thing, she won't go out with me alone, ya know?"
-No.
"-No, what?"
"No, what Henry?"
"Not for sale, not even for display."
This guy operates in a vacuum.
Which speaks to the intensely private nature of his obsession.
Mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand.
Also from upstate New York?
"No, it's local."
Most likely from the Platte River.
"What's the matter, Sergeant?"
It's what they found next to him in the sand.
Human bone and tooth enamel.
"Please, don't hurt me."
Please.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
"Uh, I was trying to call Hotch, but it kept going to voicemail."
He's still at the hospital with JJ.
What's going on?
"Ok, I did what man chocolate asked."
I got this list.
"There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list."
Does anything specific jump out at you?
"Aside from the horribleness of it all, no."
"You know, send me all the police, hospital, and child services transcripts associated with the cases."
Everything on all of them?
"Yeah, I'll print out hard copies here."
Ok.
"You're gonna need a forklift, and I hope you're using recyclable paper, but..."
On its way.
All right.
"Thank you so much, Garcia."
Why are you doing this?
I never did anything to you.
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war than the typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in a uniform, like every mother's son."
That is if he ever had a mother.
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub spawning spontaneously in saw dust."
No.
"A lot of men are scared we won't go into our boxes, when this is all over."
Makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied it.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
What's this?
Lunch.
"Girls compile the boat at home, right?"
"They compile it, the bloody boat... they can lead the damn fleet for all I care!"
But Johnnie.
Freeze the propeller.
You're late!
I took the liberty of ordering.
It's alright.
"We've guests, eh?"
Friends from Poland.
Things are very bad in Europe.
It's not exactly a picnic here.
If you haven't noticed.
You can't find a decent waiter in service since they joined the war.
"They all got rounded up in so called ""Enemy of the State""."
Apart from Jepetto over there.
Rumor is that he is a spy.
Ceres.
"In fact, they are the same path."
Hmm.
Good.
Good.
"But, there is so much more to understand, Adolf."
- So many died--
- Stop!

"Obfuscation keeps people guessing-- the little feints, the ambiguities, contradictions... ln my first four years, as head of the Nazi party, I forbade photos to be taken of me."
"To my surprise, the efforts to keep these things hidden created a cloak of enigma."

They talk.
They were kept on edge.
"Yeah, better delete that last section."

We're running out of time.
The attack's supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.
So getting Jind Allah to talk is our only chance of finding them.
- Time I confronted him with the truth.
- What are you going to do?
Show him my hand.
I'm going to give you the respect of telling you what just happened.
A team of agents raided an omega cell location.
"Actually, both of them."
Our men are in place in Annandale as we speak.
You gain nothing by remaining silent.
Jihad is forever.
Something's wrong.
His hands.
"Gideon, something's wrong."
This guy seemed relieved by what you just told him.
Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
- Get everybody out of there.
- Now!
Now!
Now!
- Everybody out.
It's a trap.
Now!
I said out!
Go!
How did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax without a single lab reporting a security breach?
Would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?
So I'll fry you and your family.

Connector of.
Connector of!
Connector of.
"81-54, how long does it take you to get there?"
I can be there in four minutes.
Do you want to drive me home?
I think my car is stolen.
Father!
Is it really you?
Shall we go and bathe now?
After all these years ... and alle the pigs I've had around me   Should I lie here alone with a cop.
How it ends for most thugs.
Their only fixed point is the cop who followed them.
What do you want?
I do not know.
APPLICATION AGAINST POLICE Västra Götaland
"for five years, I have worked the police in Västr a Götaland, -"
- See Annex 1 on signed and tasks performed by the code name Lisa.
Now I am uncovered and live on the run with a pr ice on my head.
"Hvisjeg was revealed, I thought, police management would help me."
Have you wondered why we live under a death threat?
Answer me!
Is it our fault?
He ar works for you!
It is your responsibility!
I thought I would get help but that did not happen.
"I have a closer look at the nemmelsen, that police management would see me dead."
Despite the police's own lawyer has exposed me to a lawyer.
- You must come with us to the station.
"- What is it, Dad?"
"""Said they didn't know when he'd be in,"
"""and I was wondering"
"""if anybody here had any idea where he would be."""
A man on a routine check...
STAGEHAND:
"Your chair, sir."
...just asks for Mr. Daley.
Thank you.
(CHUCKLING)
"Well, you're absolutely amazing, sir."
You're right.
And here I thought you were in shock.
"No, you didn't."
You thought I was confused.
Perhaps scared.
And probably playing for time.
Amazing.
What makes you think her murder was premeditated?
"The usual thing, sir."
"Little facts that plain don't fit, you know, sir."
"Anything I hate, it's one of those little facts."
"Doesrt ever seem to matter how small it is, either, sir."
It could be this big.
Like he left the credit cards behind.
"I mean, why does a street robber grab money from a wallet and leave the credit cards?"
They're won'th a pretty good piece of change on the black market.
"You see what I mean, sir?"
Credit cards.
What else?
"Oh, there was an alligator bag."
A diamond ring.
"I doubt very much if a robber in a hurry, on the edge of panic, is gonna take the time to pull the ring off of Claire's finger."
"Well, you know, ma'am, that's one of the strange things."
"Uh, actually I was on night duty when it happened."
And I was there when they remove your brother.
"Uh, he was working under the hood,"
"Apparently, when the car jumped out of gear."
Well?
Is there something else?
You're looking at me like you expect me to say something.
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I was wondering if you knew where the battery
Is on your brother's car.
"Under the hood, I guess."
Isn't that where there are?
"No, ma'am."
"In your brother's car, the battery's behind the seat."
"You see, they have these two 6-volt batteries wired"
Together to make a 12-volt.
I don't know about electricity and cars.
"Well, anyway, there's one more thing."
The driver thinks there was someone
"Else there, that your brother might have been pushed."
"No, he was alone when he left here."
"Well, it's the way he fell backwards into the car."
The headlines...
Please.
OTIS:
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I...
I have to check on everything.
[Greta whining]
"Hey, that sure is a fine dog you got there."
"Hello there, old girl."
- All began on the same day.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
"From Latvia to Lithuania, from Estonia to Slovakia,"
"from Russia, from Poland to the Ukraine-- wherever we found them."
"250,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed nuggets... harvested for the Third Reich."
"Nordic nuggets, to lighten up the dark Bavarians."
They took children from their parents?
They were misplaced Germans.
We brought them home.
( rhythmical resounding sound )
Eva:
"Look at you, posing for my camera, as if you didn't know I was there."
Hitler:
Do I look more mysterious in a hat?
( Eva giggles )
Eva:
Why did you never wear an official army
- SA or SS uniform?
- Better to remain undefined.
Suggestive indefiniteness.
There are so few public pictures of you smiling.
There were none before I was chancellor-- nor any with children or small animals.
The holiday in Iceland was a joyous time for my sisters and me.
You should have come with us.
You were always inspired by the Viking sagas.
The only flaw in the trip was a delay before we departed from Hamburg.
I had no time for holiday trips.
The police came just before we were to leave.
A family was removed from the ship.
- l'll never forget the cries--
Huh?
How 'bout Yale?
Collateral damage.
Acceptable losses when you consider that with interest there's over twenty million in Kozlenko's account right now.
"Aw, c'mon partner, just think what we could do with that money."
"You been planning this for a long time, huh?"
Nah.
"You know, you got out when you should."
I stayed too long.
"I got bounced around, passed over."
"You know, the last time I really enjoyed the game was Berlin."
Right before the wall came down.
"So, you started thinking about the money."
"Yeah, checked some records."
It was forgotten about.
"I mean, c'mon, it's all sitting there, right there."
"I think I'm gonna follow your example, bro, and not share."
You are gonna tell me your code numbers and Marta's code numbers.
Oh.
"Oh I know you way too well, partner."
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're not gonna shoot me.
You couldn't pull the trigger.
You're right.
The only thing I'm gonna regret is that you won't remember what an asshole you've become.
I wonder what two shots would do?
"So, how did it go?"
Couldn't have been smoother.
They didn't ask any questions?
Transferred all the funds to a new account in the Cayman Islands.
Oh baby.

"During the war, I fought side-by-side"
With captain america.
We defeated the enemy...
"Please, don't do this."
We have time.
...But I lost the love of my life.
"I work for the ssr,"
"Things didn't work out with Mark's dad, so, that was the end of that."
- Why didn't it work?
- Is there any more soup?
You were together and you got pregnant.
I didn't love him.
There was someone else before who...
"I also left him, even though he was the one who..."
"Well, it wasn't to be."
That's all right now.
I need to take this.
You can stay as long as you like.
And I'd also be happy to have a picture of...
"- Yes, what's up?"
- Why did you stop me?
Your Special Branch guy deserved to die.
You've seen what he's covered up.
Where is Emilie Zeuthen?
"I need your help, Luna'."
We know you didn't take her to Jutland.
Is she alive?
The book lists 12 black cars that day.
One of them picked up a little girl.
I need names and social security numbers on the 12.
I'll take care of the rest.
"No, give yourself up and give me Emilie, then I promise to solve the case."
I'll call tomorrow night to get the names and social security numbers.
I can't give you that.
Doesn't your daughter deserve for the case to be solved?
Your blood matches hers.
"I promise that her killer will be punished, but you need to give me Emilie."
I 'll get a copy of the car numbers in the morning and then I 'll start'.
OK?
Of course.
Look at that face.
And he's even more beautiful in person.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Wait a minute.
You know Jesse?
From when he came into the office.
Swoon.
He let me take my picture with him.
"Yeah, there he is."
"Thanks, Janet."
"You met Jesse, and you didn't tell me?"
What was he doing here?
"Sometimes when famous people have trouble with fans, they come to us for help."
And that is all I can say because of...?
Confidentiality.
That's my little lawyer.
Okay.
IAndiamos comer tacos!
"Hey, thanks for hearing us out, Mr. Price."
"You be good, Serena, or you know who's gonna hear about it?"
Captain Nico!
"Hang on one second, sweetie."
Mr. Jackson.
"If there were anything I could do to ease your family's pain, I would do it."
So I hope I can count on you not to pursue the matter through my wife.
"Sure thing, Mr. Price."
"'Cause you and me, we both know how important it is to be able to count on somebody."
There's nothing there.
I can hit three buttons right now and tell you what street vendor in Shanghai serves the juiciest sheng jian bao.
NASA can tell me what every rock on every moon of Jupiter has for lunch.
"Somewhere out there, there is software that can pull an image out of that blur and save a little girl's life."
What's with the gym bag?
"Just got back from a ""Boxercise"" class at the gym."
"""Boxercise""?"
What kind of queer shit is that?
- I'm learning self-defense.
"- You wanna learn self-defense, you come to Daddy."
"I mean, all during the '60s, before I met my whore wife, I was a boxer."
They called me Frankie Fast Hands.
"Frankie Fast Hands, everybody."
"Yeah, keep livin' in the past, Dad."
"Is this about that stupid Million Dollar Baby movie, Dee?"
"No, actually, Mac, it's about being left with a mugger... because my chickenshit brother and his friends ditched me."
- You ditched your sister?
- Absolutely.
- With a mugger...
- The guy had a knife.
Of course we did.
What were we supposed to do?
"If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique."
Technique don't mean shit out on the streets.
Guys have knives.
Yeah.
"In boxing, there are rules."
"On the streets, we ain't got no rules."
Ain't no rules out on the streets.
"- You guys got no rules on the streets, you."
"- Oh, please."
"Will you stop talking about the streets... you three jackasses, like you've been there?"
"I mean, any underground street fight in Philadelphia, you'd find tons of technique."
- You think you could teach me?
- In a month I'll have you kicking all their asses.
Right.
Where did he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes.
A headpiece like that one.
Except around the edges which were rougher.
"In the center the Frenchman had a bit of a crystal... and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They've made the calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig."
Out away from the camp.
"The well of the souls, uh?"
"Come, come, look!"
Look here!
"Sit down, come!"
Sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning...
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
What about the height of the staff?
Did Belloq get it off of here?
"Yes, it is here..."
"This was the old way, this means six kadams high - 'about seventy-two inches'"
Wait!
And take back one kadam... to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
What we want to talk about is...
"They keep you pretty busy out there, don't they, Chief?"
Sure.
You got six people dead out there all at the same time.
We don't get that here.
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
"Colored boys, generally."
Just like out there.
One of them sticks another one over a card game or some shit.
"Chief Dixon, I think we should discuss..."
Craps sometimes.
You were wanting to know about this boy's uncle.
I think we hit the jackpot.
The uncle's place is the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.
"It's out in the woods, northeast of town, over this old rickety bridge."
You couldn't find a soul out there if you didn't already know where to look.
"You boys being from the city, you'd be lost in 10 minutes."
"But I'll be with you, so you don't have to worry about that."
"Damn, Bonnie."
Excuse me?
"Oh, nothing."
CHERYL ANN:
They were out of onion rings so I got you tasty taters.
"It's L.A., Cheryl Ann."
Chief Jenkins and them.
"Yes, sir?"
Will this be a promising avenue of investigation?
"Oh, it's a promising avenue, all right."
Me and my deputies can start setting up a surveillance now.
"Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that until we get a game plan?"
"Well, if you say so."
JENKINS:
I'm not sure.
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
I like cows.
That's not the point.
It was its own point.
Go on.
I'm a scientist.
My ability to think is my bread and butter.
"I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
"Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years."
My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
"Okay, I'm still trying to work this out."
How did Penny meet an astronaut?
I don't know.
The regular way people meet astronauts.
Most of those guys live in Texas.
"Obviously, this one doesn't."
Okay.
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.
"People meet, Howard."
God!
Fine.
"You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that."
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.
"Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't."
"Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?"
I'm sorry.
What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
"""A proclamation to modify the quantitative limitations applicable to the imports of wheat gluten."""
"We are just a little rococo, aren't we?"
Why is Molly Morello less worthy of a proclamation than General Pulaski?
- I wish I knew who Pulaski was.
- This is what I mean.
"She's not less worthy, but neither is she more than the other ninety thousand public school teachers who are retiring."
Who weren't lucky enough to have a staffer as a former student.
- That's trouble.
- Who would find out?
"""Who would find out"" is also where we frequently find trouble."
- You're right.
- Yes.
"All right, you're right."
- Hey.
- You get it done?
- Yeah.
- He's taking his name off it?
Yeah.
"Well, it feels like we're almost done in there."
You wanna tell me what this meeting's about now?
Replacing Hoynes.
- What are you...?
- Bruno wanted us to look at replacing.
- Josh.
- So we're looking at it.
"We're looking at it, and everybody's treating me like... ."
- Why?
- There's electoral math.
- Was I sent away?
- No.
- So I wouldn't be at that meeting?
- No.
Mr. Drew's escaped!
What?
!
Mr. Drew's escaped!
"We left him in the room, come out and see the fun, and when we went back, he was gone!"
"Why, you..."
let's get him!
"No, wait!"
We'll get him when he gets his fingers in the flypaper.
"Cornele, i told you, i've fallen among thieves!"
I ain't been righteous to you on account of jim fisk.
"He led me astray, and that's given me a misery in my conscience."
I want to get him out before he gets me out.
Ahh... now we've got at the bottom of this.
"Cornele... of course, i don't like to do business on a sunday... but it looks like me and you is gonna swap horses."
What about fisk?
Has he got anything to say?
I put him in.
I can put him out.
Uncle daniel in the lion's den!
"Say, what is this?"
"I'm sorry, commodore."
"Your butler told us that nobody was allowed through the front door, so we came- when a final settlement is made, boys, you'll be in."
"You bet your giblets, we'll be in."
"What's the deal, commodore?"
I get 5 million for half of my stock.
Drew says he'll take it out of the erie treasury.
"Why, uncle daniel, don't you know that my army is defending all that money?"
"That money's mine, too!"
I'm treasurer of erie.
You were the treasurer.
"We'll settle this right now, commodore."
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You havetopayattention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
"But there are better homes for those boys, elsewhere."
This is win-win.
"Good for the orphans, good for Charlestown."
"That Newman Home, it's as old as our city."
Old being the key word.
Your town is a rotten relic.
"Now, you can be seen as the man who finally helped save it, or be blamed for standing in the way of progress."
"Rest assured, there will be progress."
Why don't we have a meeting of the council before you leave town?
- Good idea.
- Super.
"- Good night, Your Majesty."
- Bye-bye.
Elbow to the head.
Elbow to the head!
"Show some bite, Hounds."
I'm warning you.
Do not make me come down there.
Do you know that golf is the world's number one vacation sport?
The average course provides hundreds of jobs.
And a pro-tour stop could mean millions of dollars in revenue for Charlestown's businesses.
A vote for Frazier Point is a vote for the future.
"And it's good for the poor little orphans, too."
"Can't wait to move into a good home, Ms Bernie."
"- That's right, Tommy."
- It's Timmy.
Timmy.
Frazier Point is a hole-in-one for all of us.
"That lady's not going to take us away from here, is she?"
You see these?
See these?
"Nothing gets by me, okay?"
He's not like any Mokra I've ever met.
I can't believe he'll really help us.
"If there's any chance for a diplomatic solution, we have to pursue it."
"In the meantime, I want continuous scans of the surface."
Standard search pattern.
I advise caution.
There's a control circuit there.
I can see it.
"If only we knew that Neelix made it back to the ship with the tellerium, then at least this would be worth it."
I regret I have no such reassurance to offer you.
We don't even know what happened to the Captain.
She might have been killed out there on the street.
That is possible.
It is also possible that she has safely returned to Voyager.
We have insufficient evidence to dismiss either conclusion.
I guess thas the Vulcan way of telling me to hope for the best.
Look who's awake.
Just rest.
You must be thirsty.
Maybe hungry?
For a little something?
"Oh, what shall I make?"
"What, what can I make?"
"What, what?"
Oh...
Where am I?
"Oh, it hasn't been that long."
I wish I had some...
There.
This will do.

What are you doing ?
I don't get it.
Don't get what ?
What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .
You mean the veterinarian man ?
"Yea, that guy."
I don't get it .
He sleeps with his patients .
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.
Why is that funny?

I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.

Mankiewicz.
She saw her mother die at the hands of the Venoms.
The four Venom brothers.
Like Mickey's four fingers.
I've only wanted what's good for Mary.
But she seeks her mother's fate.
What can one do...
"Two days before retiring,"
"And still sizing up guys who sell both the cannons and the fodder, the catchphrases."
"But I keep trying, with the wild horses."
"Mickey, you, the limpet."

The entire photo fights against death.
"Against time, against break-ups..."
Against things we'll never see again...
"Anyhow, that's not important."
Unlike the pictures.
Where is this?
It's in London.
The same hotel room as before.
"The same bed, of which we can't see the..."
The convolutions anymore.
What I liked is...
"The contrast between this extraordinarily serious, studious person..."
And the idleness...
Of the same man...
Sitting...
Unoccupied...
Waiting for I don't know what...
"Which isn't part of his official, public image."
What I really liked was the contrast between this incredible dignity...
Of his reading position...
"And this sort of idleness, waiting for something."
Of the same person.
Is that you?
"Oh, you shouldn't ask questions like this."
Whether it's me or not...
All the pictures are me.
"But yes, here that's me."
I think I was very stoned.
I also was in New York at that time.
"Not the same year, by the way."
I simply... just...
I countertyped this picture.
Right.
What were you doing there in the first place?
"She had called the office looking for me, so I was just following up."
I see.
So you didn't actually speak with her?
No.
No.
Bad timing.
I assume she had something to tell me about the trial or her testimony.
- So it's not a total loss.
"Not to be insensitive, but it is lucky you found her body when you did."
"I'm looking into the possibility of a mistrial or better yet, if the police find anything suspicious,"
I'll argue for the charges to be dropped altogether.
"So good work, Danny."
That's not why I brought you in here.
Rodriguez bank robbery case?
- It's yours.
I thought Burke was handling it.
- He was.
Now you are.
- Burke was first chair.
"Danny, you've earned it."
Plain and simple.
Now get out of my office before I change my mind.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
I will not let you down.
I bet you won't.
"But that is a big case, so you better get to work."
I'll have Burke bring the case files to your office.
"Thank you, sir."
"Danny, that's wonderful."
The King and Queen of this year's Snowflake Ball are...
Harvey Kinkle and Sabrina Spellman!
(cheering)
Sabrina?
I thought dancing alone was embarrassing.
I can't believe she's missing this.
"Hello, um, I'm really grateful for the honor and all, but since Sabrina's disappeared, maybe you guys should pick somebody else."
SABRINA:
No!
Sabrina?
"Ow, my foot!"
Sorry.
"Dreama, do me a favor."
"Go onstage and stall them until I can find the camera, would you?"
"Okay, but only because people are starting to think I'm talking to myself."
SABRINA:
Here I am in my moment of glory and no one can see me.
Too bad I'm not a bigger fan of irony.
She's really levelheaded and pretty down to earth.
Is that girl talking about me?
"Yeah, I voted for Sabrina, too."
"I mean, she's nice and she definitely doesn't follow the pack."
"Oh, great, I dieted until I became invisible and spent a load of money on a dress and they voted for me because I don't normally do that."
I'm back.
All I needed to restore myself was a little self-esteem.
And I definitely don't need to diet.
"In fact, if I don't eat something,"
I'm going to keel over.
Mrs. Quick!
Sorry about your dress.
"Oh, that's okay."
"If you don't mind, I think I'll keep this for the next time I swell up."
The limit as delta t approaches 0 of r of s t plus delta t minus r of s and t.
"In this situation we're holding the s, you can imagine, in constant."
"We're finding its change in t, all of that over delta t."
And the same thing falls out.
"This is equal to the partial of x with respect to ti plus y with respect to tj, plus z with respect to tk."
"Same exact thing, you just kind of swap the s's and the t's."
"And by that same logic, you'd have the same result but in terms of t."
"If you do this pseudo mathy thing that I did up here, then you would get the partial of r with respect to t times a super small change in t. dt, our t differential, you could imagine, is equal to r of st plus dt minus r of s and t."
So let's box these two guys away.
"And in the next video, we're going to actually visualize what these mean."
"And sometimes, when you kind of do a bunch of like, silly math"
"like this, you're always like, all right, what is this all about?"
"Remember, all I did is I said, what does it mean to take the derivative of this with respect to s or t?"
"Played around with it a little bit, I got this result."
"These 2 are going to be very valuable for us, I think, in getting the intuition for why surface integrals"
look the way they do.
"So in problem 44, once again we have the exact same setup that we had in problems 42 and 43."
But now they're asking us the number of A in T sub p such that the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"Well, we've already done some work in problem 43 in figuring out some set of the members that are divisible by p."
"So why don't we just figure out the total number of members of T sub p, and then subtract the total members whose determinants are divisible by p, and then we'll get this answer right over here."
So what's the total members in T sub p?
"Well, for a, I have p possible choices, right?"
"If I'm picking between-- up to p minus 1, but I'm including 0, there's actually p possible choices."
"So I have p possible choices for a, p possible choices for b by the same logic, and p possible choices for c."
So I have p to the third possibilities.
So there are a total of p to the third members in T sub p.
"Now, what did the last problem tell us?"
This was number 43.
It told us the members-- maybe I should write it this way.
"The number of members, numbers of A's, such that the trace of A-- this was the language I used in the last video or the last problem-- such that the trace of A not divisible by p, but the determinant of A is."
And we got the answer as p minus 1 squared.
"We have to want until next week to see, but it's, it's kind of clear to many of us that perhaps this larger arrangement, the network, the environment as a network might be greatly influencing the kinds of resource dependencies as well as the kinds of meaning."
Making and sense making that go on between firms in that environment.

Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion

For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you
"I can't say no, I can't say yes"
I can't even write down my own address
"I can't touch Heaven, it's a little too far"
It's the only way to travel
Got dreaming on a par
I'm staring through the window
Wondering where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every nation
From the harbor to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state
They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no to you
"I can't stand up, I can't stand still"
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense
"And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur."
And everybody's happy about that.
(Laughter)
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
"And then, then, then, and then ..."
"Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire."
"And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around."
"So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos."
(Laughter) (Applause)
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
"Now if you want dinosaur DNA,"
I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
"Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen."
"And one of my former doctoral students,"
"Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing."
"And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there."
"They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world,"
like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
"And so she thought, well, what the heck."
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
"But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin."
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
"So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project."
"And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them."
"And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff."
They don't take money from these various companies so you can trust that they are going to be honest in their evaluation.
So some good sites to use when you are making some purchases.
But there is information gathering.
"Phase Il, Evaluating Some of The Alternatives."
Let me tell you on page 195 there is What Kind of Spender Are You?
An excellent exercise.
So excellent I even made this a part of your assignment.
"So, when you get to your assignment and it sends you to page 195 and then it asks you to answer 1, 2 and 3, that right there at the bottom where it says 1,2 and 3 that is what I am referring to in that assignment."
Then this book is talking specifically about vehicles.
"So, when you are doing your comparison type shopping several things you need to look at when buying a vehicle."
"Now you would use similar type things on other major purchases, but look at used vehicles, new vehicles, and then also look at the other option of leasing a vehicle."
Lots of different things weigh on which one you need.
If you are on the road all the time and you put lots and lots of miles on a car it may be that you need to purchase a new vehicle.
We never purchase a new vehicle.
When you drive off the parking lot with a new vehicle the value of that vehicle goes down thousands and thousands of dollars because once you buy it it becomes a used vehicle.
"So, let someone else lose all that value on it."
"The average used car is $10,000 less than a new one."
We buy low-mileage used ones.
"Usually they are cars where either someone buys it, they don't drive it a lot."
The last one we bought was from an elderly couple.
She was actually ill and it was her car.
She never drove it.
"So I got a nice luxury car for the same thing I could have paid for an average new car, but I have a nice nice car."
If I would have bought a new car
"I would have a new car, but I wouldn't have had all the luxury."
It would have just been an average car.
"So, I prefer to buy used."
They have gotten all the lemon bugs worked out of it and we have just always found that to be a much better option for us.
Of course we drive our cars until they are worn out.
"So, you know we are not trading it in every year."
"If you like to drive a new car and you can afford to drive a new car all the time, that is wonderful."
You might look into purchasing.
"It's a strong contingency to natural chemicals, more toxic chemicals are natural chemicals."
Which mother would give cancer to her child?
"When we are romanticizing nature, we are putting us down, because the mother is good, so the child is bad."
"So, there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"We can learn from nature; it's a partnership, it's learning, it's being proud of our own qualities as well."
Our natural lifetime expectancy is 30 years.
"When we get older, it's our creativity, it's our civilization, it's our science, it's our industry, it's our medicine."
"So, we don't need to talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"A mother would not have a girl losing her leg, just by biting."
No.
"So, there is no reason to romanticize nature, because when we romanticize nature, we always feel guilty."
"And out of guilt, we are not creative,"
"Out of guilt, you cannot develop new things."
"So, it's about becoming native to this planet."
Why do we delegate being native to the Yanomamis?
We are the native people of this planet.
Why do we delegate being in harmony with nature to Aborigines?
We are the aborigines of the planet.
We are the natives of this planet.
"If we don't learn to become natives to this planet, then, we will destroy each other."
"For example, we talk about overpopulation, you could see the curve of overpopulation."
The weight of ants; it's about to four times more than of all human beings.
"And because ants don't make waste; because ants live only three to six months, because ants never take elevators, they are equal to 30 billion people in their calories consumption."
"So, we are not too many, we are just stupid, we make waste."
"Even when we think about ""zero waste"", we think about waste."
"It's the same thing, when I tells you, ""Don't think about the pink crocodile!"""
We think about the pink crocodile.
But nature doesn't think about waste.
Nature only makes stuff for biological cycles.
So we can learn from nature.
But we do not just live.
"We like washing machines, we like computers."
"So I'm, I'm limited to what I can show."
So there's certain kinds of regulation over what kinds of information can be shared.
"So, resource dependence varies from a variety of factors."
"There are different types of resources and they can vary in value to their importance and availability, and then certain actors and institutions can control discussion over those resources."
"Now clearly, important rare resources are of greater value."
"More over, actors and institutions that have the greatest disccretion over these resources and the least amount of dependence, will be the most autonomous and capable for forging certain relations with other firms in the environment."
Once we went on vacation
Where the sun always shines and the snow is unheard of
Once we went on vacation
Where there's always a lot of sky and salt water.
"In the morning we went to a wine degustation,"
And the next day we went down with a headache.
Then we drank a lot of stale water
And the next day we went down with stomach ache.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers."
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"We went to a travel agency,"
For an excursion to bars and bistros
We went mountain climbing to the clouds and eagles
The Ministry of Emergency Situations rescued us from there two days later.
"Then gipsies foretold us good fortunes,"
It was so expensive that it nearly made us cry
"Then we picked up with two girls in a bar,"
And the next day we were down with clonidine intoxication.
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers"
"Sea islands, buenavista."
"The ribosome is composed of a large and of a small subunit and these are depicted in the film as tumbling, rolling clusters of body amorphous by themselves, but organized and structured when in the act of translating the message."
First the small subunit with the aid of an initiation factor captures the message.
Then the first transfer RNA carrying its quanine amino acid is brought to the ribosome message complex by a second dancing initiation factor.
This requires energy and that is represented by a puff of smoke.
"Next the large ribosomal subunit tumbles into place and then the process of bringing each amino acid to the ribosome message complex is accomplished by the T-factor and its GTP cohert and so in the order prescribed by the balloon colors in the message chain, each amino acid is brought to the assembly site to be added to the growing chain by the peptide synthase."
"Next in an energy requiring step the messenger RNA, tRNA complex is shifted so as to bring the next message unit into the ribosome to allow the process to repeat itself."
At the end the terminator factor seeing the termination signal clears the completed protein from the last tRNA releasing it from the ribosome.
So that the ribosome can do its job again the two subunits are split apart and separated from the messenger by the ribosome releasing factor.
"My diagram is of necessity static, but protein synthesis is a dynamic process."
This movie tries to bring those dynamic interactions to life.

And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture.
"The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras, and those cameras can, frame-by-frame, reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment."
"So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject."
"And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us."
"So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this."
"But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet."
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count.
"And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons."
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
"This was when we had our ""Aha!"""
This was the breakthrough.
"This is when we're like, ""OK, we're going to be OK,"
"This is actually going to work."""
"And the ""Aha!"" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses."
Right?
"So, effectively, we ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing."
(Laughter)
"From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face."
"So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes, a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing."
"Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44."
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
"We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry."
"And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji, and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time."
"And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin."
"So, in the spirit of ""The Great Unveiling"" -- I had to do this --"
I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
"We created three of these: there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60."
And this really became the template for moving forward.
"Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad."
"So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct."
For the most part we have acting out kids altogether.
"But, he, academically he does very, very well when he wants to do it."
"I don't know, some days I can go into school, sit down, not say a word, do everything."
"And everyone will say, wish we could have Adam like this all day without his hat on, without him talking, doing all his work, asking for more work."
And other days it's like Adam comes in and starts goofing off.
So real high school turned out to be another missed opportunity.
He's a fragile guy right now.
"You know, I want him to be successful."
"But when you don't give a student what they need, the potential for really falling apart and giving up is so high that you really have to factor that in."
It's a possibility.
A year later the school has expelled Adam for poor behavior.
"Once again, adrift,"
Adam has held a variety of odd jobs.
And his mother fears he is back on drugs and alcohol.
"When I was a little kid I dreamed of going to college, going to school."
But I haven't finished high school so I can't go to college.
Now I have no high school diploma so I just work full time.
It's like what else do I have?
Nothing.
I see kids every single day that are like Adam.
And sometimes I can get to them.
And sometimes I can help them.
And sometimes they slip by.
But there's no reason that Adam needed to slip by.
We had Adam.
We had a hold on Adam.
"What Adam needed, the experts say, was the hardest thing to get, early recognition of his problems and a consistent plan for dealing with them."
In some states the size of prisons are predicted on the basis of third grade and fourth grade literacy rates.
"So it does portend an alienation from society, in a sense."
"And it's for those reasons, these downstream consequences of loss of self esteem, poor academic development, limited vocabulary and other cognitive developments, difficulties with social relations, difficulties getting and holding jobs, and getting in trouble with the law that we consider reading problems to not only to be an educational issue but a public health issue and a public health concern as well."
Now Adam's parents are left with what they had at the very beginning but only that they still have hope.
You change your dreams.
"Let's say what this actually means, divide and conquer."
Divide and conquer says basically do the following: split the problem into several sub-problems of the same type.
"I'll come back in a second to help binary searches matches in that, but that's what we're going to do."
"For each of those sub-problems we're going to solve them independently, and then we're going to combine those solutions."
And it's called divide and conquer for the obvious reason.
I'm going to divide it up into sub-problems with the hope that those sub-problems get easier.
"It's going to be easier to conquer if you like, and then"
I'm going to merge them back.
"Now, in the binary search case, in some sense, this is a little bit trivial."
What was the divide?
The divide was breaking a big search up into half a search.
"We actually threw half of the list away and we kept dividing it down, until ultimately we got something of size one to search."
That's really easy.
"The combination was also sort of trivial in this case because the solution to the sub-problem was, in fact, the solution to the larger problem."
But there's the idea of divide and conquer.
I'm going to use exactly that same ideas to tackle sort.
"Again, I've got an unordered list of n elements."
I want to sort it into a obviously a sorted list.
And that particular algorithm is actually a really nice algorithm called merge sort.
And it's actually a fairly old algorithm.
It was invented in 1945 by John von Neumann one of the pioneers of computer science.
"And here's the idea behind merge sort, actually I'm going to back into it in a funny way."
Let's assume that I could somehow get to the stage where
I've got two sorted lists.
How much work do I have to do to actually merge them together?
So let me give you an example.
"Suppose I want to merge two lists, and they're sorted."
"Just to give you an example, here's one list, 3121724"
"Here's another list, 12430."
"I haven't said how I'm going to get those sorted lists, but imagine I had two sorted lists like that."
How hard is it to merge them?
"Well it's pretty easy, right?"
"I can't take it anymore, move out of the way"
Mr.Mahmoud wants you
What does he want?
"What are you doing, dad?"
"Come on, world cup is approaching"

Morning Ellen
I believe you're going to give us an update on some of the work you've been doing?
Yes - last time I did a blog I'd just began treatment on this beautiful lentoid and now I've actually finished it.
And I've updated the housing for the object and now you can see all the beautiful features that are present.
One thing I wanted to point out before we take a closer look at the object is that we actually take a number of samples of everything that we remove from each object and that includes the soil from the cells and it also includes things like corrosion products possible organic materials and if we do happen to find any tiny garnet fragments in the soil.
So all those things are saved and I constructed this little housing so they don't rattle around.
Just as an example this is the soil from the bottom and the left cloisonné cells in the object.
"Okay, can you just turn that round for us so we can just see the soil moving in there?"
"Okay, so that's an example of all the soil that you've kept."
And you were saying other things that you might of kept are just small fragments?
Any tiny fragments that I discovered that are unusual or notable in any way so for an example this is sort of a green black lump that's a compressed possible corrosion product that I found in the cells.
This is an interesting feature that I thought I would point out this is one thing that I found through excavating one of the central cells here and that's a remaining rivet.
There are actually several rivet holes present and you can see those on the back of the object
Is there indifference or is there passion?
Passion is the measure of a media business that has valued for the long term.
"You can get away with selling ads for a while for example to large numbers of casual people, but they pretty well will knew, passion is how you build a community, how something takes on a life of its own."
"And, what I saw at TED was not only what the 800 people there -- you know, really influential people!"
But they had a level of attention that was way off the charts.
"I mean, they were there for 4 days."
They were focused.
They were engaged.
They used words like  'this is the highlight of my year'.
"I mean, this was a media thing that just exhibited extraordinary passion."
"So, I thought"
TED is amazing.
"And I also thought, Wow, it's an incredibly potent media asset, if you like, in the making."
"There's something really, really amazing here."
"So, I started to dream about whether there might be some way I could play a bigger role."
"And you know, to cut a long and complicated and occasionally painful story short, 2001, a foundation that I had set up found itself as the proud owner of TED and I got to run it, and I was terrified."
"First of all, business I'd been building had been smacked hard by the dot-com bust."
I'd had to lay off a thousand people off the workforce.
I knew that it was time for me too to leave.
I felt like an abject failure.
"If I failed at TED as well, there would be nowhere to hide."
It also didn't help that I knew nothing about the conference business.
(Laughter)
"Or, that I had none of Richard Wurman -- who had been the sole owner --"
I had nothing of his huge stage presence.
"So, the goal number one was ""Don't screw it up."""
(Laughter)
"And, I worked really hard to figure out, what was it about TED so special?"
"""Don't touch that."
"Only tweaks."""
"Some of the early tweaks included professionalizing the logistics of TED, courtesy of these two amazing Canadian twins, the McCartney sisters, who put on events with attention to detail that I hadn't seen before."
"And then as far as the program was concerned, it was just continue this process, make it -- continue the process of broadening it out, you know, bring in more people, brought in more scientists, more out-of-the-box thinkers, more non-Americans, more women."
The two connect.
"This year here at the Mechina is a very, very significant year."
It creates a real revolution among these young men.
"And slowly but gradually, through all the experiences and laughs, you see how these kids stabilize, kids who walked around with a kipa, but with spikes underneath with all the gel in their hair etc.."
"The hair slowly but gradually gets shorter, they begin to dress differently"
like a Talmid Chacham.
Something stabilizes within them.
Two words the Mechina gave me:
Torah and Life.
"As far as I'm concerned, they are both the exact same thing."
The Mechina brought Torah into my life.
It totally changed my life.
I understood this at the Mechina itself which was one of the most significant things I've ever done.
I think that only after looking at the long-term will I be able to see just how significant and essential it impacted my life.
"After a year-and-a-half at the Mechina,"
"I received not only direction, but also serious momentum to begin life in the best way possible."
"Our spiritual situation when we came here wasn't exactly ""up there"", and had we enlisted directly into the army, we would have absolutely experienced [spiritual] burnout."
The Mechina saved us.
"Thank G-d, we see amazing success at the end of the year when we see the same student who, was began the year with an earring, and at the end of the year before enlisting in the IDF, the student makes a Siyum Masechet/concludes a book of Talmud and with this Siyum he enlists in the IDF in a combat unit, nonetheless!"
Amazing!
"""Magic"", perhaps, but I call it ""Divine Assistance""..."
"I became so attached to this place that the decision to get married happened right over here, on the steps."
"I came here with my wife, even after the Mechina had already moved elsewhere."
I took her to these steps and we talked and I felt my best in this place
I felt here the most confident to tell her that I want to marry her that I love her and want to build a Jewish home at the very place which helped me know what a Jewish home is...
I'm carrying around the centre of Europe. i like the idea very much.
"Lisboa, it's the centre of good food, good nightlife."
"- Open to the world, to multiple cultures."
"- Its' kind of becoming the centre of cultural evolution, in its own way."
"- And I think it can be the centre of Europe, because it captures the European culture."
- This is Lisbon: ... open-hearted.
- The centre of Europe?
Sub-string search.
So first thing is how to compute the hash function.
"So we take the, just convert the Math."
So R's our Radix.
"So in this example, we're using ten so we have decimal numbers."
"And then the digits, say t's of i That's the text characters."
"So we have a number x of I, which is the,"
"M characters starting at position I. And that's just in Math, ti*R to the M-1"
"So you know, in this case that's two10000+61000+5100+310+5 that's just"
Math for that.
And our goal is so it's an N digit base based our integer modular Q And our and our goal is to do the math.
That gives us the remainder that we would get when dividing that by Q well there's really easy method called Horner's Method that we can use to evaluate a degree in polynomials just with a multiplied M multiply and add.
"And we can do the modular computation all the way through at each step, to keep the numbers less than q and we still get the same result."
"And so the idea is, you multiply by R."
"You go from left to right through the digits and you just multiply by R and add the digit, and then do mod q at every time."
So we start with two mod 97 is two.
To six mod 987 is two*10+6 mod 987 and that's 26.
And then I take that value.
Multiply by ten and add five that's 265 mod 997.
"In that case it's, it's 265."
So 265*10+3 is 2653.
"Our remainder is divided by 997, it's 659, so even though our number gets bigger than 997, might take them out every time, we keep our running total less than 997."
And then the last step is to take the 659.
Basically we've thrown out a bunch of multiples of 997 that we don't care about.
And 659*10+5 mod 997 is exactly equal to 26535 mod 997 and that's 613.
That's our value.
"So that's A using Horner's method we got a, well known linear time method to do compute or hash function with this simple code."
"And this notice will work even for a huge key that we wouldn't compute a hundred dig, convert a hundred digit key in to some number to do the calculation."
We do one digit at a time using Horner's method and then we have no limit because we're always keeping our numbers less than our prime queue.
"So that's a first step, so no matter how big the pattern is,"
"We can efficiently compute a hash or, since that is the first step."
So now the second step for the Rabin Karp algorithm is to realize that if we know xi mod q we can efficiently compute xi+1 mod q cause they have a lot of digits in common.
"I have some trauma or an injury, but I might have to run away from a lion tomorrow."
"So fix-fix-fix Sal now or fix David up so he can run away from a lion tomorrow, but in the wild I might not have lived to 40 anyway."
So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50?
Once they're past the point of reproduction.
Dr:
"Right, the body has to choose priorities."
The priority is today rather than tomorrow.
"An amazing study was done where we gave patients what we call a ""statin""."
Statins are drugs that were developed to block the synthesis of cholesterol.
"We thought, you know, people with higher cholesterol--particularly the bad one, LDL--those people have a higher incidence of heart disease."
"So, if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease."
What do you know?
We did!
A dramatic effect:
We lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs.
S: so it seems like they worked!
Dr:
Right.
"Then a company, or a very clever group did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs."
"It also had a dramatic effect, in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years,"
Wow and it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%.
S:
"So cancer, something we don't normally associate with cholesterol."
Dr:
"So it turns out these drugs, which are the biggest drugs in terms of sells we ever had, worked by lowering inflammation."
"So the affected heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol, it was predominantly by lowering inflammation."
And the affect on cancer was by lowering inflammation.
"In fact, remember when the swine flu came out a couple of years ago?"
"If you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins."
S:
Because it would stop the inflammation.
"Because with swine flu, people were dying from inflammation going nuts."
They have a form of language.
[high pitched ape sound by man.]
And they use more complex tools than anyone realized.
"By looking at the differences and similarities between apes and us, we may find the secret ingredient that makes apes apes and humans human."
We take it for granted but self-recognition is a fundamental building block of human society.
We exist as individuals.
Each with our own unique features.
Scientists believe self-recognition is essential for our survival.
We can live in large groups because we recognize similar features to our own in others.
We can tell friend from foe.
But is self-recognition uniquely human?
Show a monkey a mirror and it thinks it's another monkey - it attacks.
But how will our closer relatives the great apes react when faced with their own image?
This 3 year old chimpanzee has never seen a mirror before.
He's not sure what to make of it.
Erect fur is usually a sign of fear or anger.
But his fear is soon replaced by curiosity.
"When chimps see themselves in mirrors the first time, they naturally assume it's another chimp."
The way a human being who's never seen themselves before does.
And begin to play with mirror image.
"Soon, this chimp will know it is looking at itself."
"Just like these older chimps, they know exactly what mirrors do."
This chimp appears to know that that's her tongue and those are her teeth.
Chimpanzees seem to have a concept of the bodily self that allows them to look into a mirror and say that image is equivalent to this body.
But how can we prove that humans and chimpanzees really identify the figure in the mirror as themselves.
Psychologists have a well-known test for this.
"It's called the ""mark test."""
A researcher marks a child's cheek.
The child then looks in the mirror.
He moves his hand up to the mark.
He recognizes himself.
"By the age of 2, half of all children tested can recognize themselves."
That dish belongs to...
Felix. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Congratulations.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Bring your dish down please, darling."
(Felix) It's a huge validation.
This is definitely one of the proudest moments that I've had in my life. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come and stand over here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I'm trying to just be humble and, like, you know, keep my composure, but I don't think that Felix deserved to win."
Which sucks.
I'm so bummed.
Great job.
Really good job indeed.
"(Felix) I did a Chinese five-spice seared duck breast, and I did a sauce for it, and eggplant and sweet potato chips."
Phenomenal execution.
Very nice.
"The sauce and everything on the plate really worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) We recognized it immediately as being&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; restaurant-quality, and the flavor &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is fantastic.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Felix)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix is now a frontrunner.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The competition is on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"So, Felix, for winning today's mystery box challenge, you're coming with us to find out your huge advantage &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in the next challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go."
"Well done.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) As the winner of the mystery box challenge,"
Felix is now the first home cook to enter the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; pantry.
"Here, Felix is in control of the first elimination test."
Each elimination test will see at least one person
leave the competition.
(Felix) I'm surrounded by the most amazing fresh produce.
It was the most beautiful pantry I had ever seen in my life.
(Announcer) Felix now gets to choose the style of food or the dish that everyone must cook.
"However, the one thing she cannot control is the theme of the challenge."
That is in the hands of the judges.
"Today, you'll be cooking one of our three most intimidating dishes."
I'm down.
"Even though I was practically raised on it, it's a dish that intimidates me because it's so difficult to execute."
And it's a dish that takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen and my mother's kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is Italian risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"And risotto refers not only to rice, but the technique involved in making it."
"Because, as opposed to steaming it or boiling it, we saute it."
"There is one dish that always gives me the chills, because you can't hide behind adding different little touches &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and ingredients&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and garnishes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
The system is off its rocker.
"To conclude, some food for thought."
"First, for the Zande, there's a no concept of absolute evil."
There's no abstract evil force or double.
There are only humans who do evil things.
Evil happens.
Rather than exists.
It happens in witchcraft carried out by neighbors and even family members.
"Neighbors aren't evil in and of themselves, usually your buddies."
"But once their witchcraft heats up, evil things can happen."
"Second, witchcraft is a total system."
"The belief in witchcraft not only explains why bad things happen, but it offers a possibility for families to fight for the health of their loved ones."
"Furthermore, because of their belief in witchcraft, the Zande do their best not to upset their neighbors and not to outdo their neighbors."
"And finally, people who believe in witchcraft are not like aliens from outer space."
"Their rational, intelligent people just like us who do their best and their particular cultural, social, historical, and environmental context to find meaning in their world."
Franz Boas has said that tradition late shackles upon all of us.
"People who grow up in Zande Land, such as these children, are as unaware of the shackles of their traditions as people growing up in the American Midwest."
"If everyone around us is wearing the same shackles, it's hard to see them."
"I think the world would be a safer, more livable place if we recognize the shackles that tradition has laid upon us, and that can lead us to believe that our worldview is the only bright one."
"For then, we'd be able to respect the validity and the beauty of other belief systems, including witchcraft."
Thank you very much.

Beth:
We're looking at a lovely little Friedrich in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin called Woman at a Window.
"Like so many of Friedrich's paintings, we see a single figure from behind."
Steven:
This is his wife and his studio in Dresden.
"We see her back, but we don't stay there."
"Instead, somehow we begin to imagine what she sees as she looks out this window."
Beth:
We imagine her life in what seems like a rather constricted environment and this really rather small view of the outside world.
This experience allows us to take the concepts we've learned and put them to work in the practical world.
At the end of the class we collaborate with Damon Lee's Film Scoring class to create a music score that fits the style and tone of our film.
This class was a great opportunity to learn the art of film-making and come out with a work of my own.

Glamour Lighting Setups
Catalogue Photo Biz Part 2
"Hey fellow photographer, how's it going?"
I'm Michael Zelbel.
Welcome to Glamour Lighting Setups.
"Even though, today's setup is actually not so glamorous after all."
We don't even have a model.
What we have is two mannequins.
And those are not even my mannequins.
"I just borrowed them from a fashion designer in the neighbourhood, who was kind enough to give them to me for a little fashion catalogue shoot, that I did for another client."
I used that last time as an example in another video of mine in which I explained to you how I think that such a catalogue shoot is so much easier for us amateurs in case we want to earn some money with photography so much easier than let's say wedding photography or let's say microstock photography.
"If you didn't watch that video please go back, watch it right now, but what you won't find in that video is explanation of the lighting setup."
"But you told me that you want to have this explanation, so today I'm doing the video with the lighting setup."
"What you want to do if you want to do such photos really really good is: you want to enable the viewer of your photos the reader of the catalogue or the user on the website wherever your photos are, you want to enable them to really feel the fabric."
You want to bring across the fabric and the three dimensionality of the garmet and what you also want is clear separation from the background.
Ideally the background is 100% white.
But be careful!
"If you too overexpose the background, then you easily get lensflare, and that really reduces the quality of the image."
So look carefully when you are shooting.
I will now show you the basic setup.
"What I used was a big white sweep, a paper backdrop, but you could also use a white wall."
Just make sure nothing in the room is really colored and could throw a color cast onto your clothes.
"All I was doing was paying off the interest on the debt I had, which was £30,000."
"I was basically rocking around the clock, really."
My standard of living wasn't good at all.
I didn't go out and the amount of money that I had for food was £40 for the month.
I came to a time when I thought enough was enough and at the time I was working in a hospital.
I started going to the chapel there and that's where I then found a book called 'Word for Today'.
I read that book and at the back of it it had a salvation prayer.
I read that salvation prayer and I gave my life to God.
I put my heart and soul in a letter and I sent it off to the address that was at the back of that book.
I got a phone call from somebody called Pastor Sheila.
She invited me to the church and she counselled me and I told her about my debt problems and she gave me some information for Christians Against Poverty.
"At that stage I was so relieved because of the fact that I knew then that I would get support, and the burden just lifted."
"Any letters, any correspondance that I had with my creditors,"
"I just directed them to Christians Against Poverty, which was a relief, basically; it just took away the stress."
"As a consequence to becoming a CAP client, I also now support people who are also in debt."
"I've learned how to budget, my standard of living has improved because I'm able to go out and socialise, which I couldn't do before."
The fellowship with the people at church is crucial as well because they also offered support.
"When you are going through debt you sort of withdraw and you don't socialise because of the lack of money, but once the stress has been taken away you're able to talk about it and testify about how good God is and how stressless you are."
"The home stretch, we're on problem 18."
And this diagram actually looks like something that this little tool I'm using is well-suited to draw.
"Let me try-- I'll draw the one in the back first, so I can do different colors and everything."
"So I'll do the one in the back in yellow, and it looks something like this."
"Goes like this, then it switches over like that."
"And then I'll draw the next one, this orange color, and it looks something-- no, I'll do it in a more drastic color."
So it does something like this.
"It goes like this, crosses over, dips down, then it goes over again."
"And then finally, this last one, and it looks something like this."
"Crosses over and it goes like that, very pretty."
Now let me switch to a smaller-- OK.
"Why don't we do white, I never write in white."
In the figure above--so they say this is the start.
And this is step 1.
Some people just have the ability to get people on their side.
They have good reasons.
They know how to explain things well.
They're just naturally persuasive.
They can sell things effectively.
They just have that persuasive power.
And that's a form of power as well.
"Well so now what we've done, we've gone through norms, we've talked about status and power."
These are all important ingredients.
"Hopefully you'll be aware of these, look for these and try to use them constructively too in your own group dynamics."
And I wish you the best in doing that.
"Stop the disco music, it steals our jobs, the Musicians' union says -"
- who demands a special disco fee and that discotheques shouldn't be allowed to serve alcohol.
Disco music on grammophone is competing dance orchestras to death.
The Musician's union now tries to save the live music by demanding a special disco fee -
- and retracted liquor license for restaurants who abandon live music for disco.
Every month one dance orchestra here in Sweden dies and the lines of musicians waiting for unemployment benefits are growing. ♪ I am a giant tree. ♪
"Janne Landegren, finalist in the Swedish Eurovision song contest qualifier two years ago -"
"- and vocalist in Telstars, one of the most wellknown dance orchestras in Sweden."
But now Telstars has disbanded.
The latest victim to the death of dance orchestras and Janne Landegren is going to the office for unemployment benefits.
-It feels tough to have to disband a group like Telstars.
"Not just because it affects me personally, economically."
-And your family?
-And my family economically to say the least.
"It also feels hard to disband a group like Telstars that have existed since 1963, for 16 years."
The Musicians' union forces so called live music upon us.
This is live music if there is such a thing.
"Today this type of public usage is totally unregulated.For example we can listen in department stores, elevators, sports arenas and discotheques."
This without any compensation to the musician who is the person actually performing.
We can't accept that.
The disco fee hasn't been decided but today the Swedish broadcasting corporation pays 32 SEK for every minute of record music played.
So christians themselves seem to value ignorance.
The apple of the tree of knowledge - they shouldn't have eaten that.
"And, in the past, they've burnt books for freethinkers alike."
"I view this competition between real science and christian science as like watching a horse race where one horse, the christian sicence horse, has died in gates and never really made it out."
And the other horse has been going for 2000 years or more.
Which one will win?
We'll see.
"- If the finish line is right back at the start, then the dead horse got there first."
- Right.
"Like so many other areas, chrisitan science is a proven failure."
"Although, we're not alone here in picking on christianity."
"All the other religions,"
"like Islamic science, or whatever, Judaistic science."
It's all the same stuff.
"- It's pretty cool, too, because you can go to the Muslim science pages and they'll tell you everything that's wrong with the christian science pages, and the christians will tell you what's wrong with the Muslims, and they'll both tell you what's wrong with the Jews."
"Actually, I don't know that Jews spend a whole lot of time trying to make the Torah and Talmud match up to science."
- The Jews aren't big on marketing.
They're happy to have their exclusive club.
"- I think the most amusing use of science by Jews is actually using science, real science, in order to find a workaround for all the prohibitions for what they can do on the sabbath."
Which is really amusing.
- Little gadgets to push the button on the elevator so that you're not actually creating fire.
"- Or a phone that's always trying to dial every number and you have it stop not, whatever."
"Anyway, it's confusing."
Continue with your...
- Modern marvels.
"Well, today I'm going to talk a little about cosmology, which is one of the big topics that comes up, some other physical sciences, a little bit of mathematics."
"Another time, I'm going to save some of the more meaty stuff for other shows."
"I'll talk about the failure of creationism on another show, and I'll talk about the failure of chrisitian medicine on another show."
"So, so much fail, there must be a god."
The biblical cosmology is primitively wrong.
It's pretty screwed up.
"There's this notion of a firmament, which is this large dome that separates heaven from the earth in biblical cosmology."
"And as the internet grew to encompass millions around the world, a new problem emerged."
"At the time, encryption required two parties to first share a secret random number, known as a key."
"So how could two people who have never met agree on a secret shared key without letting Eve, who's always listening, also obtain a copy?"
"In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman devised an amazing trick to do this."
"First, let's explore how this trick is done using colours."
How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret colour without Eve finding it out?
The trick is based on two facts:
"One, it's easy to mix two colours together to make a third colour, and Two, given a mixed colour it's hard to reverse it in order to find the exact original colors."
"This is the basis for a lock, easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction."
This is known as a one-way function.
Now the solution works as follows:
"First, they agreed publicly on a starting colour, say yellow."
"Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select private colours, and mixed them into the public yellow, in order to disguise their private colours."
"Now, Alice keeps her private colour, and sends her mixture to Bob, and Bob keeps his private colour, and sends his mixture to Alice."
"Now, the heart of the trick."
"Alice and Bob add their private colours to the other person's mixture, and arrived at a shared secret colour."
"Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact colour, since she needs one of their private colours to do so."
And that is the trick.
"Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction and hard in the other."
"This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic."
"For example, to find ""46 mod 12"", we could take a rope of length 46 units, and wrap it around a clock of 12 units, which is called the modulus, and where the rope ends is the solution."
"So we say ""46 mod 12"" is congruent to 10."
Easy.
"Now, to make this work, we use a prime modulus, such as 17 then we find a primitive root of 17."
"In this case, 3, which has this important property that when raised to different exponents, the solution distributes to uniformly around the clock."
3 is known as the generator.
"If we raised 3 to any exponent X, then the solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 17."
"Now, the reverse procedure is hard."
"Say given 12, find the exponent 3 needs to be raised to."
This is called the discrete logarithm problem.
And now we have our one-way function.
"Easy to perform, but hard to reverse."
"I think first and foremost that you can explain to people the only thing that counts in life is to develop yourself in the good sence, being a good person ... and then learn that being with other people also means imply giving up things"
"We owe it to others to take care of them, and it is a very but that is very difficult for people to learn even if it, in fact is pure logic"
Martin:
But isn't that very greek?
Ole:
"It is very Greek and very Christian, and the Christianity is good"
Martin:
Then it is very Greek beeing so very good ..
Ole:
"You could say so, yes ... and not only Greek / Catholic"
We must help to build a society that is not just about claiming a lot of stuff for ourselves but a society where we help and support others and not because we thereby help and support ourselves
One becomes wiser beeing a decent person
I try as good as I can to explain that to people although I wonder why it should be necessary
"One also have to try to take your own medicine which is the worst of it all, but I'm working on it"
Martin:
"But perhaps the paradox of this project is that if you have to be really really good to yourself, there is some who interprets it as ""not caring about others"""
Ole:
"No, I do not think that, that is the way to take care of yourself..."
The Greeks had a slogan saying
"""εαυτό τους"" meaning ""look after themselves"""
"In latin it is ""cura de se"".. um.. but does not involve any form of selfishness"
Martin:
But there ought not be a difference in taking care of yourself and take care of other
It should be able to go well together
Ole:
"It should be, because we are the others hostage and we only exist because the others have been there to begin with"
Martin:
"But then, why does it not work?"
Ole:
I think this has much to do with not prioritizing the right way in our upbringing and our education
Take private schools..
Earlyer they were there for those students who didn't do so well in the public schools
But it's done over that theme of blow the man down which is about violence and the threat of squalls and storms at sea.
"And the fact that, that carries from the deck onto the drawing of the line on the map."
Where that X is placed.
"Is a, is a very strong sense of, of foreboding."
"Something will go wrong, and then it brings us to the ship at night."
Now this scene is a straightforward exhibition scene.
It's interesting because the guy serving coffee seems to be really angry at the world.
But watch what happens after it's done.
Back to the ship at night.
"Now interesting, we don't need any voice over, all we need is the face of Finn, the sound of the wind, and the mysterium theme to come back to give us this feeling that something is a mess that all is not happy and easy on the surface, and that there are very, very deep and wrong things going on."
"And this is the, the secret of alludent film, that the atmosphere is always there undercutting even the easy placid moments."
You can never get rid of the monsters.
The monster or the monsteress.
"Now the sinister texture of sound all pays off in the climax of the film, which is quite troubling and disturbing, but beautifully, beautifully done."
"Now, the climax begins with something that we might expect, an orchestral score showing Stone's madness."
[music]
"And his voice over, we're finally getting subjective access to his character's psychology and now we all know this man is completely cracked."
"It's going to climax when he's going to go back to that sign that we saw in the very first scene where he met his junior officer and no longer can face this, we see the madness in the strictness of his authority here."
[music]
"Right, now that's the climax of the score for the moment."
It's going to drift down now.
And as he pulls that sabre off of his wall.
We've been wondering what would happen to that.
We cut away a little bit of exposition as the good guys.
We guess they're good guys.
They don't anything in the end.
They're wondering about the telegram and get this.
[music]
"Billy Radd, again starting his calypso."
[music]
"And it was quite a jaunty, happy number as we see."
[music]
And you can confirm that I found for these numbers that theta 1 is about 7.5 degrees.
This is now for maxima.
And so roughly at an angle which is half that value you will find silence.
Silence means that the two radio waves will kill each other.
Essential for the maximum to be here is of course that the two transmitters are in phase.
We could have rigged it up so that they were 180 degrees out of phase in which case there would be silence here.
Silence in this case means that the radar would kill the radar.
"But I do use the word silence for a good reason, because the way we rigged this up is the same way we did it before."
We modulate this 10-gigahertz signal with a 1000-hertz audio signal.
We call that amplitude modulation.
And the receiver which is here receives the 10-gigahertz radiation which is modulated at 1000 hertz.
We feed it to an amplifier.
We demodulate it and you will hear the 1000 hertz.
And so we can also move it along this track here and find the location X1 whereby we have our first maximum apart from the 0.
And I found that that is very roughly at 15.5 centimeters.
And you should confirm that using those equations.
Equations are the same.
"Whether you deal with sound or with red laser light or with gigahertz, makes no difference."
And so let's turn now to this demonstration.
I will turn on the -- the two transmitters and here is the receiver which is exactly at angle theta 0.
So there's a maximum.
"I'm now going to close one transmitter, [tone] put my hand in front."
[tone]
And you think about what will be the reduction of intensity of the sound here.
[tone]
"If I close one, it's substantially down."
You may think that it is down by a factor of two.
Because we have only one transmitter instead of two.
You're wrong.
"If you think that, you do not understand interference."
It is 4 times lower when I hold my hands over one.
Figure it out for yourself.
"After the summit with Nehru Prime Minister then, introduced my grandfather to the citizens who gathered."
"He introduced,"
"""We have a special guest form great country called Japan."
Japan once fought with and defeated Russia.
"And that gave India inspiration and hope to strive for independence."""
"At the time, Japan was still recovering from the defeat of the World War Il."
And so I was told from my grandfather that Nehru Prime Minister's speech deeply encouraged Japan and my grandfather.
"I, as a leader, would like to strengthen and develop this long relationship with India."
"I wish India Center further success in the future; with wonderful leaders like Mr. Vibhav and Mr. Yoshimi Ishikawa, I am very confident."
I call upon your support for the cause and I would like to send my best regard to the India Center.
It was a coincident that the MC of today's ceremony gave a campaign speech for me during the election.
It gives me a sense of fate with India Center.
I would like to end my greetings with graces to India Center.
Thank you very much and congratulations once again.
ALEX FAABORG:
"All right, good afternoon."
Thank you coming.
"This is Advanced Design for Engineers, and really glad to have you here."
"Design's often broken into two components, form and function, and this talk is no different."
"We're going to have Christian Robinson presenting on form, and he designed the Roboto typeface."
"And I'm going to present on function, on interactive design."
"And I got to work on Google Now, which launched yesterday."
"So as you can imagine, I'm incredibly tired."
"Being engineers, you guys know how launching software isn't making sure everything's perfect in the end."
"But while I am physically incredibly tired, I am extremely excited to be able to give this talk."
"The thing I love more than actually doing interactive design is teaching it, so it's really exciting to get a room of incredibly smart people and to provide all of this information to you So let's dive into interactive."
"Now this is a room of engineers, I'm assuming?"
Raise your hand if you're an engineer.
"Yep, OK."
"So often engineers don't have a tremendous amount of respect for design, and it's not that they don't think design's important."
"They realize it's critical to the success of their application, but the reason they disrespect it is it's not controllable in the way that software is normally controllable, and hardware, because you're dealing with people, and people can be kind of random."
"The onus is on you to educate me deeply about this thing that I'm not even interested in."" There's no way to overcome that kind of requirement, nobody can win that argument."
But it turns out that usually that reasoning is wrong.
I've heard that argument about why we shouldn't have to worry about closure.
I've heard it about why we shouldn't use recursion.
I've heard it about why punch cards are better than timesharing.
"You can go all the way back to 'it's better for us to be programming with digits, I don't understand why we need compilers'."
It's been going on from the beginning.
"That's why software development is so slow, because basically we have to wait for a generation to die off before we can get critical mass on the next good idea."
[laughter]
This is Grace again.
See the 'courtesy' badge?
I had to pay $200 to get the rights to use this picture.
"It was actually $100 but I wanted lifetime rights, so I can use it from now on."
"I'm going to use it a lot, anytime I can."
[laughter]
"I've used it twice tonight, so that's $100 per view."
"I'm getting it down, I'm getting it down."
"We've gone a long way since Grace created the discipline of software engineering, but we still have a very long way to go."
I think we're not as far along as we should be at this point.
"I think we're mainly not farther along because of that 'waa, I don't want to have to learn anything' problem."
"You are not those guys, and that's why you're here tonight to hear me rant about this."
"I appreciate that, and I think that shows a lot of value for you."
"The big surprise for me in this is we're about to take maybe the most important step we've ever taken in terms of the technology of the web, and JavaScript is leading the way."
Who would ever have imagined that?
"JavaScript is now being the technology leader, it's not just the thing that we tolerate."
Wow.
"But there we are, that's where we're going."
"Goodnight Grace, wherever you are."
"And goodnight, thank you very much."
[applause]
"I don't see very much now, I used to go quite often to see dance, and theatre shows and cinema and so on"
"I've got two small children now so I don't go and see very much but what we have seen in the last few years has really been around stuff for children that they'll enjoy free, open air things, maybe at the Southbank or something or theatre shows that are for children."
"Finally, ask the patient to swallow."
It should be done without difficulty or regurgitation.
"Cranial nerve Xl, the Spinal Accessory nerve, innervates the sternomastoid and upper trapezius muscles."
"To assess this nerve, ask the patient to shrug his shoulders upward against your hands."
"During this maneuver, evaluate the strength and contraction of the trapezius muscles."
Practitioner:
Good.
Can you turn your head to... [fades]
"Then ask the patient to turn his head to each side, against your hand."
Observe the contraction of the opposite sternomastoid muscle and note the force of movement against your hand.
"Cranial nerve XIl, the Hypoglossal nerve, mediates motor functions of the tongue, which in turn affect articulation of words."
Inspect the patient's tongue as it lies on the floor of his mouth.
Observe for fasciculations.
There should be none.
Ask the patient to stick out his tongue.
"Note any asymmetry, deviation, or atrophy."
The tongue should protrude straight out.
"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this station, we're going to practice putting a naso-gastric tube in for a feeding tube and then we're also going to practice doing a bolus feeding and a tube feeding by a pump drip, continuous feed."
So first we're going to need a feeding tube.
"We could use, this would come in a clean package and I would have opened this up, and this is the Levin tube."
"That's a long, single lumen tube and it has pre-marks on it, to help you know to make your marking, to know how far you're going to insert it."
And so I'm going to put my clean gloves on and then I would have opened up my package.
"So I'm just using clean technique, because it's going into the stomach."
So I would open up my package that has a clean tube in it.
"And I took this out and have clean, now it's clean."
"First, I need to measure how far I want to pass it."
"So I want to measure it from the tip of the bottom part of the earlobe, all right?"
"The tip to the nose, to the nares, and then I'm going to add from the nares to the stomach, the middle of the stomach."
"So I want to about that marking, that's about how far I'm going to want to pass it."
"I want to have my patient with their head slightly forward, because if their was tipped back, that would open their airway, and I want to go into the stomach."
I can lubricate the end a little with water or may get some lubrication.
"If the patient's alert, they can swallow some ice chips while I pass to help this go down the right way."
Dooby-doooby-doo Doo-doo-doo-di-da
"Hey there, it's Kati again."
Thanks for coming back to check out my videos.
"Today I'd like to talk about a tip, that I give to all of my client's I even have to give it to myself repeatedly to remind myself about this."
"And this has to do with people suffering from anxiety, stress, depression."
"You name it, this is something that we should all constantly evaluate in our lives."
"And that is, not spending time with people who are bad for us."
Okay well that sounds really easy.
People who we hate probably don't hang out with.
People who are really mean to us we probably don't hang out with.
"But if you really think about it, there are probably people in your life, that I call ""toxic"" friends."
Especially when we're talking about eating disorder people.
"We go into inpatient, we're there with maybe six to ten other girls, some of which want to get better, like you, working hard to pull through, and it's really difficult, and they're there to help support you."
"Those are great friends to have around and that's what I'm hoping to cultivate in this website, is a big support system of people rooting for us, right, to do better not to do worse."
"But there's always a few people in those treatment programs, who kind of make a life of being in treatment."
"They don't really want to get better, and they kind of pull the rest of us down."
"They even put up websites and things to help ""promote"" anorexia and"
"""promote"" sickness."
Why would you do that?
These are people that can hinder you're recovery.
"And I know it's hard to let people go, and I'm not saying that you have to tell your friends, or call them up and say,"
"""hey you know what?"
"I was watching this video and I'm not friends with you anymore. 'click'."""
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying limit your interaction with people like this.
"Because I guarantee, if you evaluate it after."
"Like, Let's say you go have coffee with this friend who is ""toxic""."
"Afterwards, you probably feel worse about yourself, you're probably counting calories, more than you normally do, you skipped a snack,"
"""not on purpose"", but kind of on purpose, because they're in your head."
"They're making bad comments about you, about themselves, about what's going on."
And those people just aren't healthy.
"So that's my tip that I give to everybody, whose suffering from anything."
"To Karen, the only sibling who proudly wears our mom's label of a ""kraut"" just like our Dad."
How tough is my sister?
"In the past two weeks she had the entire nursing shift at the Sherman hospital taking care of my dad replaced, had a senior services cleaning lady fired and ensured one hospice nurse would never step foot in my parents house again."
Karen like my sister Theresa is a registered nurse.
"As we contemplated every angle to maintain a quality of life for our dad,"
Karen illustrated a balance of compassion and professionalism that let me nothing short of proud.
At one point in the hospital Karen paid a visit to the nursing station to rally the troops
"""I realize you're short handed, and have many other patients."" She said"
"""But selfishly the only person I need you to care about right now is my Dad."""
Trust me they understood her message
To Donna
Ding Dong Donny
At times I believe your sole mission in life is to ensure mom and dad are truly enjoying their golden years.
"You helped them to experience so many joyful times culminating perhaps, in their trip to Vail in April for the wedding between Alex - her son - and Ali."
"From baseball games, to Lake Delavan getaways, your generosity was never lost on the man you affectionately called ""Daddio."""
To our mom
An individual who has never had any issue
looking someone directly in the eyes and telling them exactly how she feels.
"We trust, when looking into Dad's eyes, those words were more often than not, endearing because until the day he died, I don't think anyone could've loved an... ...could've loved an individual more than our dad loved our mom."
Which brings us to our Dad.
I think my family is lucky because our parents did raise us to express ourselves and to not hold anything in.
"For this reason, I believe my Dad knew how important and how much he was loved by each of us."
He doesn't need to be here today to hear it.
He already knew.
"Nonetheless, those voices in my head are echoing a few final words of gratitude that I would like to share."
I'm grateful for the love of music Dad instilled in me.
"For those Sunday afternoons when he would play some Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Glen Miller, or one of his old 78 RPM records records on his stereo and often offer a subtle ""SHH SHH, just listen to that."
"Isn't it beautiful?"""
I'm grateful for the love of fishing Dad instilled in me.
"The nights before a fishing trip with my Dad were like Christmas Eve,"
I struggled to get to sleep and I woke before dawn.
"Dad convinced me we had to hit to the lake early to have any success,"
But all three that you can tell are leveling off.
"We in Computer Sceience, about seven years ago, hit a ledge and it was a problem."
"We couldn "" t make the computers any faster."
"We couldn't make the frequency faster, we couldn't use more power, we couldn't make the computers as we thought we could."
They couldn't follow this exponential curve anymore.
"What happen was we were making too much heat, way too much heat."
And we'll get to that.
"But, we solved this problem by making multiple cores."
"If we have multiple cores, they could do multiple things at the same time and that's increase of speed the same way."
"And as you can see the Parallell, the"
Parallel Thread Performance has increased and while the Single Thread stays the same
Awesome.
"So, heat, computers have this 0's and 1's transistors,, and every time you change it, it wastes heat, and capacitors, we'll get to that later."
"But it wastes heat and you can see this graph that over time we had some hot ones, and cold ones and so far we've been able to cool them with heat sinks and fans."
Nothing too special.
"Around 2000, we started making really hot computers and back in 1995 [INAUDlBLE] was as hot as a hot plate."
"Loves this example, that if it's as hot as a hot plate, and you had an egg that size, you could fry the egg on your computer because it's that hot."
Wow.
Come on.
"So, computers have only gotten hotter."
They've actually gotten to the heat of a nuclear reactor.
"Of course it's not gigantic, it's just the size of a quarter."
But it makes as much heat as a nuclear reactor.
And soon we're actually even close to rocket nozzles and the sun's surface.
They're just going to get so hot.
"And we've made all kinds of cool cooling systems with hydration and water and air and just really crazy cooling systems, and we've found that we just can't keep this up."
There's no way about it.
"So it ws like a game of chicken, who's going to give up first, and around 2004, 2005, we gave up and we got to the heat of a nuclear reactor and after that we just gave up."
"We can't cool it anymore, So we just moved to multiple cores."
Cool.
So let's see why this actually helps.
Well having multiple cores actually makes it more power efficient.
"Your life would be better if you could work a little less, if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier, if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner -- it's all in there, over and over, again and again."
Washington?
I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know.
I just know that that's a front in this war.
"And right here guys, Silicon Valley,"
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
How many people have their Blackberries?
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
"Good grief, not to this crowd."
(Laughter)
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
"And nobody celebrates imitation the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys know it has to be done."
"Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?"
All of that?
That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it.
"So, we've got this new toolbox, you know."
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
They look like the stuff we walk around with.
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
"And I realized, probably too late in this game --"
"I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin."
I got a lot wrong.
"So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor."
Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits.
"I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little."
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
The infrastructure is a huge deal.
"This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties"
like any other war.
The infrastructure's the first one; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.
"For example, sending them overseas so they can rest their bodies, and sending them to sanatoriums."
"In case of Fukushima, the current radiation level is so high I'm afraid such measures may not be enough."
"After all, they have eaten produce from local sources."
"Fukushima is ""Forbidden Forest"" of Belarus, so to speak."
Forest so dangerous no one can enter.
"Still, many people including children are allowed to live in the ""Forest."" I cannot permit this."
And such unusual changes in health do not happen in Fukushima alone.
I think this issue should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner.
"Indeed, there are many areas with high radiation in Kanto where children should be evacuated out."
"In Belarus, in the areas where the radiation level simply exceeds 0.1 microsievert, children did get ill, though you can't simply compare those areas to Kanto because they're self-sufficient."
But there are actually people in Kanto who claim to have nosebleed and diarrhea.
"As Dr. Hida [expert in internal radiation exposure] pointed out, if you see both nosebleed and diarrhea, that's a clear sign of internal radiation exposure."
I think it's OK for us to be overly nervous.
The most important thing we need to do now is to protect children.
It's better to overreact now and be criticized for the overreaction later than not doing anything.
"As we have seen today, various problems are happening one after another."
Those who can escape should do so.
And we have to remember the importance of keeping a record if any unusual change in health happens to us.
"Ms. Noro, thank you very much."
We will end our program with the forecast of the dispersion of radioactive particles by the German Weather Services over the next three days.
Please watch out for the weather and the wind direction when you go out during this weekend.
On the ninty-sixth day we sailed again.
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
Goddamn them all!
"I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, we'd fire no guns, shed no tears..."
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
The Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays but to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
Goddamn them all!
I hope you try them all and enjoy them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Hugo."
"Now, you know, what we've talked about is we've talked about the importance of mobile, and we've also talked about the mobile--the importance of the connection with the super computer."
We've not talked about much about entertainment and YouTube and so forth.
"But we, in fact, do want to talk a little bit about Google Television. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Yes, of course, we've saved the best for last."
"So with no further ado, I'd"
"like you to welcome my colleague from the Google TV team, Brittany Bohnet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BOHNET:"
Thank you.
So you would never want to buy a computer without an Internet browser.
"In these days, especially after that demo, you'd probably never want to buy a mobile phone without an Internet browser."
"Soon, you're never going to want to buy a TV without an"
Internet browser.
And I'm here today to show you a few examples of what's possible when you have an Internet browser on TV.
"First, a few notes before I get started."
I want you to understand the context here.
Google TV is launching this fall in the US only.
"And while we're very excited to bring Google TV over to places like Europe, unfortunately, we don't have anything specific to announce at this time."
So consider this a sneak preview.
"Now, I'm actually not demoing on any of the final hardware today."
You see here a dish satellite box that I'm using to control my DVR recordings in the presentation.
The box on top of it is a generic development box that we're testing the Google TV software on right now.
I'm even using a random wired keyboard that I picked up at an electronic store a few days ago.
"It has full QWERTY keyboard functionalities, a pointing device and some"
TV specific buttons.
"Now, when we come to market in the US this fall, we'll be launching with three devices from Sony and Logitech."
"Sony is launching a Google TV powered HDTV, as well as a Google TV powered Blu-ray player."
Logitech is launching a Google TV powered box that connects to the TV you already have.
"Now, both of these OEMs are going to be building incredible remote controls that you can use with the TV."
"However, you can also use your"
"Android phone or iPhone as a remote control as well, and, yes, you may be able to do some of these incredible voice commands, that Hugo just demonstrated, on your TV."
Can you imagine searching for a channel name and watching your TV tuned to the channel?
"And obviously when a media corporation appears in a context of collective enthusiasm, there can be problems."
But I don't think it's very intelligent.
"I mean, I understand the reaction, but it has been proven afterwards that it's a reaction that doesn't benefit, but rather is detrimental for what was happening there."
You need people to insult you through the media.
You need people to manipulate you.
"You need people to distort your words, because there are a lot of people who don't succumb to that manipulation, who don't succumb to the insults, and who don't succumb to that distortion, and realises that you're not what the television says you are."
"It's a lot better to be insulted, I know it's a drag to say"
"""it's better for people to talk bad about you than not talk about you at all""."
"It's not exactly that, but you have to open yourself to the media and accept that they're going to hit you."
"Yes, they're going to hit you."
What's important is that there are other media outlets that understand you.
"Not because you're good to them or because they're on your side, but because ""each to his own"". there was a day"
"I was at an assembly where it was decided, or it looked that way"
"I think they didn't decide on it in the end, they decided that the only camera that could record there was the camera of the Sol audiovisual commission."
"You stop for 15 seconds to think where that's going to, what kind of model of communication it's going towards, and it's scary."
It's a bit scary.
Fortunately that didn't happen.
So there have been a few moments but in the end everyone always realised there was no sense in it.
But you see it's not coherent with who you are.
ST:
That is definitely NOT the 15M.
JL:
Definitely not the 15M.
Not letting the media work is not coherent with the 15M.
And yet I understand the indignation against the media.
Perfectly.
ST:
I participated in two assemblies in which I spoke about this topic.
About prohibiting cameras.
"One was on the 16th, I remember perfectly, the first day of the camp, saying that it was impossible. and the other was the same, but three weeks later."
And they were going on about the same thing curiously.
JL:
"""You have a serious hearing problem"",  she tells me."
"""You have a serious invasive problem"",  I tell her"
"""When I talk to you,  you don't listen..."""
"""When I'm focused in my work you talk to me and I don't know whether you're talking to me  or you're just talking!"""
"And then began the crossed accusations, you, you ,you."
"Now, how would it be  if instead of this accusations of speaking in second person, we could  reverse it and talk in first person?"
"This is how I see it,  maybe I am wrong but it is what I believe."
"How would it be if instead of  always trying to dominate, we could look into what is happening?"
What do you need?
What do we have to talk about?
"And, how would it be if instead  of trying to always impose ourselves, we could propose."
"Making it neither your opinion nor mine, but finding a creative way  of making it ""our"" opinion, right?"
What we're talking about is a misterious art.
The art of handling filters.
And it has at least three parts.
"The first,  is to recognise that I have my filters, it has to do with me, it is a biased sight of a much wider reallity, from where humility emerges."
"On the other hand,  recognising that you have your filters too and you also have a biased sight  of a much wider reallity and maybe even you have some information  that can be useful for me and that is where respect appears."
"And finally taking your filters and mine and construct a bigger filter,  which is more useful, more complete, more valuable."
There is where collaboration appears.
"How are our relationships seen  when they are based in values such as humility,  respect and collaboration?"
"Taking this into my example, with humility,  the matter would be of recognising that, okay, it is true that I have  an irritating capability sometimes to isolate from the exterior world, I respect the fact that it bothers you, as well as I ask you to listen  to the needs I have."
"Lets collaborate together  and find an option, when you want to tell me something,  ring the bell, text me, wait, clap your hands, or hit the cymbals."
"And tomorrow at the end  of the school day, I will willingly pick-up the kids, sit them in the park and we'll make balls of glue and we'll take them to the 24/7 guy across the peninsula of Yucatán."
(Aplause)
You ever been to Miami Beach?
Yes.
With a girl?
Yes.
Particular girl?
"Particular, yes, but she didn't carry a gun."
I've heard about those nights down there.
"They're warm, very warm."
And last but not the
"least, in order to give you the chance to get a question to Mr. Schmidt, please raise your hand."
We have ladies on each side of the stage with a microphone in their hands and we will guide the microphones to you.
"Once you have the microphone, please get up, state your name and your outlet and start shooting the question."
I think that's basically all.
The Q&amp;amp;A section will probably be limited to about 10 minutes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, so please give a warm welcome to the COO of the Messe Berlin, Dr. Christian Goke."
Welcome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Thank you, Steven."
"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon."
"Usually, when I'm standing"
"here in front of you trying to kick off the keynote, I'm either trying to present the speaker, or the company, or I'm trying to give a short summary of what have happened so far at our show."
"Today, there's obviously no need at all either to introduce the speaker or the company."
"And on the other hand, our show is running so smoothly, we are hitting new record numbers that there is time--very little time for a very brief observation."
Most of you--as you do know by now that our show started in 1924.
"1924, that was only six years after the end of the First World War; and in 1929, after some years of Europe again blossoming and a period that was later on called the Golden 20s, in 1929, the party abruptly stopped; Wall Street crashed."
"And one year later in 1930, almost to the day 80 years ago, Albert Einstein himself delivered his first keynote to our show here in Berlin; another radio talk."
"And then again only three years later in 1933, Hitler's Nazi regime came into power."
"So, what I'm going to say is, this was a very special moment in time when he delivered his first keynote here in 1930, 80 years ago."
"And what he said in essence was, ""Technology enables communication and communication enables democracy."" And I think"
that this statement is more valid today than ever before.
And it should really remind us that every new means of communication has a direct impact on our political system.
"So,"
"ladies and gentlemen, I'm reasonably sure that Albert Einstein somewhere up there is watching us and he is looking forward as much as we are to the closing keynote of IFA 2010 given by the chairman of the board and the CEO of Google."
"But before we start; film up, roll on the movie please. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, our lives are changing fast."
"Now, our lives are changing fast."
Hope that something pure can last.
Hope that something pure can
last.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
The fact that scientists quantitative is a huge theme in the course.
We'll be focusing on operational definitions in the next couple of weeks.
You'll get to practice that later on in the course.
And organize skepticism is another big thing.
This'll really be a focus in week three.
But we'll start thinking about it now.
Welcome back.
We were in the midst of figuring out the Laplace transform of sine of at when I was running out of time.
This was the definition of the Laplace transform of sine of at.
I said that also equals y.
"This is going to be useful for us, since we're going to be doing integration by parts twice."
"So I did integration by parts once, then I did integration by parts twice."
"I said, you know, don't worry about the boundaries of the integral right now."
Let's just worry about the indefinite integral.
And then after we solve for y-- let's just say y is the indefinite version of this-- then we can evaluate the boundaries.
"And we got to this point, and we made the realization, after doing two integration by parts and being very careful not to hopefully make any careless mistakes, we realized, wow, this is our original y."
"If I put the boundaries here, that's the same thing as the"
"Laplace transform of sine of at, right?"
That's our original y.
"So now-- and I'll switch colors just avoid monotony-- this is equal to, actually, let me just-- this is y."
Right?
That was our original definition.
So let's add a squared over sine squared y to both sides of this.
"So this is equal to y plus-- I'm just adding this whole term to both sides of this equation-- plus a squared over s squared y is equal to-- so this term is now gone, so it's equal to this stuff."
And let's see if we can simplify this.
So let's factor out an e to the minus st.
"Actually, let's factor out a negative e to the minus st."
"So it's minus e to the minus st, times sine of-- well, let me just write 1 over s, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
I really hope I haven't made any careless mistakes.
"And so this, we can add the coefficient."
"So we get 1 plus a squared, over s squared, times y."
And let's say its mass is 500 grams.
And let's say that I can accelerate this vehicle at an acceleration of-- I don't know-- 3 centimeters per second squared.
What's the force that I need to apply to this mass to accelerate it at this speed?
And we want the answer in Newton's.
So what's the force?
So we're just going to use Newton's second law and
Newton's second law tells us force is equal to mass times acceleration.
"So you might want to, or you might be tempted just to multiply mass times acceleration and you'd get force is equal to-- let's see, 500 grams times 3 centimeters per second squared."
"And you would get force is equal to 1,500 gram centimeters per second squared."
"And if you did this, you would be right."
"Although your answer would not be in Newtons and now you would have to somehow, try to convert this set of units to Newtons."
And what are Newtons?
"Well we learned when we did Newton's laws that a Newton, so 1 Newton is equal to 1 kilogram meter per second squared."
So somehow we have to convert the gram to kilograms and we have to convert the centimeters to meters.
"We could do it after the fact here, or what I find it easier to do is actually to convert the mass and the acceleration units first and then just do the F equals ma."
So what's 500 grams in kilograms?
"Well 500 grams is half-- well, a kilogram as a thousand grams."
So 500 is going to be half a kilogram.
"1 kilogram is a thousand grams, so 0.5 kilograms is 500 grams."
"Similarly, 3 centimeters is how many meters?"
"Well, 1 meter is 300-- sorry."
I think I'm dehydrated.
"1 meter is a hundred centimeters, right?"
So 3 centimeters is 0.03 meters per second squared.
Hopefully this make sense to you.
3 centimeters is 0.03 meters.
And now we already.
We have our mass in kilograms and we have our acceleration in meters per second squared.
"And if this is confusing, you should watch the unit videos because this is all I'm doing; I'm just doing unit conversion."
So let's go back to force equals mass times acceleration.
"So the force was equal to 0.5 kilograms times the acceleration, which is 0.03 meters per second squared."
And this equals--
"[INAUDlBLE] just take the cost of the machine and estimate the amount of time we want, and then divide it?"
JON GRUBER:
Sure.
"No, and I'll cover that later."
"You could think of the rental-- if I bought the machine today and sold it tomorrow, that'd be like I rented it."
And this would be the cost difference between what I paid for it and what I'd sell it for.
"But it's just easier to think of it as the rental, because the flow measure-- like the wage-- is a flow measure."
"Now, in the short-run, capital is fixed."
"So in the short-run, our fixed costs are rk bar."
"That's our fixed cost, the rental rate times the fixed amount of capital in the short-run."
"And our variable costs are w times I, which is a function of q."
"That is, the more you produce the more labor you use in the short-run."
"So total costs in the short-run, short-run total costs, are rk bar plus wL of q. k is not a function of q because k's fixed in the short-run, but the amount of labor used is a function of how much you produce."
"This implies that the marginal cost, the key concept we want to work with, marginal cost, which is the derivative of total costs with respect to quantity."
"So dc dq is going to be equal to w-- or, let's do it in deltas, because we're not doing calculus here."
Delta c delta q is going to be w times delta I over delta q.
That's going to be the marginal cost.
The marginal cost-- so I'm just differentiating the total cost function-- is going to be the wage times delta I delta q.
"So the marginal cost of producing the next unit is going to be how much labor I have to produce to produce the next unit, times the wage I pay per unit of labor."
"Now, does anyone remember what we call this?"
"I know this wasn't on the exam last night, so you may not-- cast your mind back to the lecture on Monday."
Do you remember what we call delta I over delta q?
Anyone?
Bueller?
No?
It's the marginal product of labor.
Remember from Monday?
So this is the wage times the marginal product of labor.
So what we say is that the marginal cost is equal to the wage times the marginal--
I'm sorry the wage over.
"I'm sorry, it's one over."
That delta q does-- I was the marginal product.
"Stone standing over our hero, who's been drugged and bound and gagged."
[music]
And we have this fight.
[music]
"It's an incredibly violent fight, but made much more tense, because no one in the scene can speak, our hero has been gagged."
The rescuers mute and of course the captain dare not say anything cause he doesn't want to bring the attention of the crew to them.
At the same time we hear off screen that calypso song.
[music]
"Which adds more tension because it really illustrates the distance between what everyone else on the crew is experiencing, and the horrors that are going on in this cabin."
How unaware they are.
"And also gives this counter point, which makes what we see on the screen all the more horrible."
Compared to the happy song going on off-screen.
"Worse and wells would learn about this, would learn from this."
[music]
In touch of evil.
[music]
"And Quentin Tarantino, of course uses the same technique of sound counterpoint to violence quite a lot."
"This is one of the first times, it's not the first time that I've seen it in a Hollywood film in 1943."
[music]
"And it comes from this B film from Lewton and Robson made at RKO. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is secure. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And of course, then, we come back to the voice over."
"And the odd thing is, Finn is supposed to be reassuring us that everything is fine."
"But if there's anybody who can't reassure us of anything, it would be Finn."
Especially when it's combined with this
"low key lighting in the bridge, and on the ship."
"And I dare you to call this a happy ending, in the end we come back to a place that's like the one where the film began."
"And it's important that when our hero goes and meets the new girl, who we don't see, we see only her shadow."
We feel the entire cycle beginning again this is our new Stone.
Because becoming a captain of ship losing yourself in work leads to this isolated madness in this world.
Now that is an overview how the film uses sound but the film also has these two set pieces.
Two moments that are there to push the audience to the edge of sanity by terrifying them.
And one set piece involves a hook and the other one involves a chain.
Now I recommend you go back and listen and think about how the chain sequence works.
But that's cheating.
And it hurts your throat.
"So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me."
"If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it."
"So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine."
"We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me."
And I'm going to show you what it can do.
"And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice,"
I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.
"This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind."
"So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple."
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time.
The simplest way to do it is something like this.
(Beatboxing)
By dancing.
It's like this.
(Music)
Thanks.
(Applause)
So that's probably the easiest way.
"But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up."
"There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like."
"So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this."
(Beatboxing)
"There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want."
You don't have to.
It's fine.
Check it out.
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
(Music)
"Now, of course, over time we worked harder and had more machines, so overall output in US economy grew much faster than 2.4% a year."
It grew more like 7-10% a year over that period.
"Yet, the point is that a lot of that we can get for free, essentially, without any harder work or any more capital."
"However, starting in 1973 until the early 1990s, productivity growth fell dramatically to 1% per year."
That is literally we lost 1 1/2% per year of stuff we were getting before.
"We were getting 2 1/2% a year up to '73, all of a sudden it's down to 1%."
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff we can get unless we work harder to make up for it.
Why did this happen?
"Well, we don't exactly know, but there's two good candidates."
"We know the two candidates, we just don't know the right proportions."
One is that we have less capital in our society because savings fell.
The amount of savings US households do fell dramatically.
And the US has a very low savings rate.
The US savings rate over this period averaged about 3%.
"That is, every dollar we earned we saved about 3% as a society."
"Compared to countries like Japan, where it's more like 20%."
Every dollar they earn they save about 20%.
Now why does that matter?
"Well, we'll talk about this later in the course, but essentially the amount we save determines the amount of capital we have in society."
"Because essentially, where do firms get the money to build machines?"
They get it by borrowing from households who save.
And the
"less we save, the less money there is that firms could invest in building machines."
And we'll talk about that at length later in the semester.
"But the bottom line is, the more we save as a country, the more money we have available, the more firms can take that money and build machines that improve our standard of living."
"And that saving fell a lot, and that's one reason."
And the other reason is that productivity fell for reasons we don't quite understand.
"We know that productivity slowed down, but we don't quite understand why that is."
"But then in the 1990s, productivity shot up again."
"So productivity went back up towards our historic levels, from 1% back up to over 2% a year."
Why is that?
"Well, it's unclear, but we think it's basically the IT revolution."
I stared at white ceilings for good  eight years before the fMRI was developed.
"In the process of that, there was  no pain management in Toronto area."
And there was tremendous suffering in my body.
That one body could produce so much suffering was an amazing thing to me.
"You have a choice in that kind of suffering about whether you are going to stay alive, go mad or do something different with it."
So I decided that what I do  is to study about suffering.
I were a case of one and  I had lots of academic work that I could do every single minute of every day.
"So, rather than the fight-flight-faint kind of approach that people often have to stress,"
"I, in fact, step in with the stress,  held it as one that holds a child  or a brand new puppy. and started to look how it changed me and made me."
I appreciated every moment.
I was like a snail walking on a razor's edge.
Every single move hurt.
"When it finally got to the point that  scientists developed enough knowledge to know what is going on with me,  they asked me how I was injured, how I not going mad,  and I was able to say,"
"I am in the process of it,  studying suffering."
I took my pain and I tried  to shift it around a little bit.
"I use my mind inside myself to try and see whether there was a place  where there was no pain, whether there was an empty spot."
So I have to say that the practice of mindful meditation  came to me through a drunk driver.
And I am deeply appreciative for him  and all he has done.
"When I started walking again,  in my mid 30s, they asked me what is it  I wanted to do."
All I had was a tremendous degree in suffering.
(Laughter)
So I took that and  I went into Palliative Care.
There are some people here today  who remember my work in Palliative Care.
"I would speak about how the kind  of work that we do with the dying, which was pharma care, grief and  bereavement, was wholly inadequate."
That this is an experience in life that is so profound that we need to be able to work  with it differently.
So I started using mindfulness meditation in Palliative Care and got results that  are absolutely remarkable.
I became a teacher in Palliative Care.
"I am a theologian and a social worker but I work in Faculty of Medicine  and Faculty of Social Work, also Bio-Ethics in the Dalai Lama's  School of Public Health."
And I tried very hard to start  to bring changes in the system and we succeeded for a while.
"Then finally I left at the age of 55 and at about 6 weeks' mark into my retirement, the University of Toronto phoned and said, ""Would you come and teach mindfulness meditation course, just one or two courses?"""
"I thought I was kind of smart, I said, ""Yeah, I can do that with my eyes closed."""
"And he didn't get the joke, but I thought  I was being brilliant."
Is this a future we want to leave for our children and grandchildren?
I don't think so either.
So let's steer towards a better future.
Thomas Berry wrote that our great work for our generation is to learn to live on the planet at least benignly.
Why would we do that?
"One reason we would do that is that our fellow living things, who happen not to be human, don't have a representative in Congress; they don't have a lobbyist in Washington, they don't have a voice at the table, and yet, they are completely dependent for their survival on our good will; much like children."
Let's talk about our country's population and our wildlife.
"We had about five million people in our country around 1800 and about 290 million people in 2000 - more now, of course."
"At a conference, I met a scientist, Andrea Laliberte, who had done fascinating work comparing wildlife sightings in the 1700 and 1800 in our country to how wildlife range today in our country."
"This chart, the pinkish areas - I'm not sure how it looks here - are where we used to have black bears."
The yellow areas are where they still are today
- you see there's been a lot of recession there.
This is the gray wolf; we used to have gray wolves running all over our country;
- the pinkish areas you see on the chart - not so today.
"We used to have grizzly bears running over about half of our country; as you see, they've receded, and we don't have them."
This was just 200 years ago.
That yellow island-like area
- that would be the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
"Let's look at a summary map: take a look at the right here - red is good, green is bad, white is very bad."
"You see that we've lost a lot of species in our country; those white areas mean that all of wildlife that was looked at,"
"- in this case, in the 1800s - it's gone from our country."
Do you think is normal not to have wildlife running around us all the time in our country?
That's not normal.
"Let's bring it home, here, to the Front Range of Colorado; tonight."
We used to have wild bison; they're gone.
We used to have gray wolves; they're gone.
"We used to have-- - sorry, my clicker's little sluggish - grizzly bears; could've been right outside."
They're gone.
"We used to have lynx, the cat; gone."
Maybe they are not leaving.
(Laughter)
"We used to have black-footed ferret, very dependent on prairie dog for their survival; gone."
We want to have debates on these programs that really matter to people and improve their lives.
"I think you guys have a very good case to be made about the work that you do, and that's what we want to keep very focused, very positive on."
"And however the process works, if it doesn't it doesn't, but you know, the main point is keeping up what you're doing, telling the story of the good work that you're doing, to encourage support amongst those who might not be supporters currently or new members who might not know about the program and also to encourage long-standing supporters who after all are still there doing great work."
I think those are very important things for you all to be doing.
Brad:
"Well, Elyse, thank you very much for that answer, and coming to the regular order, it was very impressive work of Senators Reed and Collins in getting 34 Senators to go on the letter to the Secretary of Energy on the reallocation in FY ""13, and we're hearing fairly soon, Elyse, from DOE."
We hope to have good news to share on that.
Elyse:
I think they had a fairly short time frame of figuring these issues out.
"The fiscal year is winding down to it almost, September."
"We are hopeful that we've made a good case, and we are certainly joined by large numbers."
I think I heard there is a similar letter effort in the House.
Brad:
Yes.
"With a number of Republicans, and that's very encouraging."
Elyse:
Yes I think those kinds of efforts really help bolster our efforts here.
We'll have to see.
We want to have a robust program.
We want there to be a program in every state.
"I think that only helps us going forward, and as we fight for FY ""14 appropriations."
Brad:
"And turning to that, we have 225 people, Elyse, listening to the Webinar."
"Let's talk for a minute about the ""14 process."
"We just want to ask folks to engage on the letter that I mentioned for the reallocation for FY ""13."
So now we're turning to a situation where we will both have outside groups like
NASCSP and other stake holders submitting testimony by May 9th as we've already done in the House.
Is April 29th the Deadline?
Elyse:
"I think we've heard April 26th, and that's a Friday."
"The reason they might have chosen that day is on many subcommittees that's the last day of this work period, and the week of the 29th is a recess."
"So I think that's why many of them chose the 26th, but I should double-check my dates."
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
And here you can see the body actor.
"And then this is what we called the ""dead head,"" no reference to Jerry Garcia."
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
"And then, again, the final shot."
It was a long process.
(Applause)
"The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides."
We had to create a lighting system.
"So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world."
We also had to create an eye system.
"We found the old adage, you know,"
"""The eyes are the window to the soul,"" absolutely true."
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
"And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed."
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years.
We also had to create a mouth system.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
Skin displacement: another big deal.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
"He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home around other old people, so he had to look exactly the same as the others."
"So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad."
"This is a very, very, very early test in our process."
"So, effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face."
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
"There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling ""the digital Botox effect."""
"So, as things went through this process,"
Double recombinents are always the rarest class.
In this case the rarest class will be these right here.
"Now, when we look at this, which two of these genes are in the same phase and what's the third one that is in different phase."
Relative to the parents.
Here are the parentals.
And we can confirm that is actually the parental phase because that is most common.
"When we look over here, the rarest two have c been coming from the other chromosome, where's the capitals are together, just as they should be so, the little m, little b, big m, big c is necessarily the double recombinant, so it must have had something like this to come to double recombination event."
So the order must be B.
"A, C, B. So C is in fact in the middle."
"Now, what we can do, from those numbers you saw."
And you can do this for practice if you want.
You can go back and actually and calculate the recombination fractions.
The recombination between A and C is only 0.8 centimorgans.
"Or if you calculated it, directly it's 0.008."
Between C and B is 15.1% recombination or 15.1 centimorgans.
So we can infer from this since A was at 11P fifteen.
"Six, B is at 11P 12.3, C is probably at or near 11P 15.5."
"In fact, this gene is actually well known to be at 11P 15.5."
It actually has already been mapped and identified.
Now lemme conclude this video by just recapping one very important point.
Goal of genetic mapping is to localize alleles and genes that cause disease.
"What you're trying to do is you're trying to find, where is that unique allele,"
"like, which gene has it."
"Cuz again, genes don't come labeled."
"Even when you have the full human genome sequence, the genes do not come labeled."
Some markers will be associated with disease.
"And those ones that show that strong association where alleles at those markers, the gene attacked at that was the markers will, will be associated with whether or not you have disease, or will predict whether or not you have disease."
Those are ones that will be near the disease-causing gene.
Okay?
Some markers will not be associated.
It will be very weakly associated with it.
And those are the ones are that are likely far away from the disease causing.
"To find the median, or middle, begin by crossing out the least and the greatest  numbers in the set until you reach the middle."
The median of this data set is three.
Now let's review finding the mean.
Here's the same graph again.
"To find the mean, we need to add each of the values together and divide by how many numbers are in the set."
"The numbers total seventy, and we divide by fifteen because there are fifteen data points."
"So, the mean is approximately four and seven-tenths."
That squiggly equal sign means approximately.
"A common mistake that students make  is confusing the mean, median, and mode because they all begin with the letter ""M"" and they do sound a lot alike."
"One way to remember is that the median is the middle,  like the median of a highway."
"The mode is the most,  they sound alike."
"And mean, or average, is the meanest because it requires the most calculation."
Let's look at this graph again.
"We decided earlier that the mode was two, so let's put a line here."
We decided the median was three; we'll put a line here.
And the mean was approximately four and seven-tenths.
These three lines show where the three measures lie within the data.
Which of these looks like the best way to describe the data?
"In this case we have an outlier, or a number that is much less or much greater  than most of the other responses."
"One student read twenty one books, and that's great, but it makes our mean much higher than it would be otherwise."
"The mean is probably not the best measure here because only four students read more books than the mean of four and seven-tenths, while eleven students read fewer."
"On the other hand, the mode of two was the most common answer but does it reflect the data set as a whole?"
Probably the median would be the best measure here.
Let's look at another data set.
Students were asked their favorite number from one to ten.
There were four different answers that all got two votes.
"So, the mode is one, four, five, and nine."
"In any data set there can be a single mode,  many modes (like there are here), or even no mode."
This is why the mode is not used very often to describe data sets.
"When we find and measure a center, we want to use a single number to describe the data."
"So, the mode here is not good."
Let's find the median by crossing out the least  and the greatest until we find the middle.
"I, I can do it and you can't right?"
Well yes but we've still made you.
Oh no that's foolish.
"To make a long story short, actually it's not a very long story but it's a delightful one."
"The robot is utterly convinced that, it is"
God's creation.
"And its, highest commandment is to keep that beam aimed at a particular spot on the surface of Earth."
And these poor humans are simply mistaken about that.
And there's no convincing the robot that they are right.
"The humans finally decide, you know."
"It may not be that the robot understands it's own origins, but it makes no difference because it will obey that commandment and so they leave."
"In other words, the robots have to know what is right for people and do it absolutely, even if they completely misunderstand what the human beings want, say and do."
"This is a fairy tale, okay?"
How can anybody know what's good and right automatically and always.
No one can.
"How could robots, therefore, be able to?"
Can they read our minds?
"Well, that's not posited, but they have positronic brains."
"As one reads through the stories in I, Robot, one goes from the beginning where you just have a robot nanny to, who was selfless, of course, in the care of her charge."
Its charge?
The young child.
"All the way through to the last couple of stories in which the main character we need to confront, who's new, is Steven"
"Bierley, the world administrator."
"The whole world, in other words."
On the basis of having robots to do good and provide the wherewithal is moving ever more toward a utopia.
"As you read the whole book, if you think of it not as separate stories but as a composite novel, the ending would have to be utopian."
"Of course, if you read the story separately that wouldn't follow."
"And the very last story, the evitable conflict, that is we can get rid of conflict."
The evitable conflict is one which Steven Briarly is having a colloquy with a character named Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin is a robopsychologist and she has been a continuing character referenced though out the book and interstial parts between the separately published earlier stories as a [unknown] was created to bind the whole into one work all feature Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin trains the technicians Donovan and Powell who go around setting up the robots.
Susan Calvin is an advisor to US Robotics the industrial firm that makes things.

In 1985 the church have closed as the roof has collapsed.
It rained and snowed into the building
It was hardly any ... left on the walls
The benches ereased as they were all ... eaten and totally rotten
Humidity was nearly constatly above 90%
And the consequences was mold and decay.
Whoever the community refused to throw in the towel.
Together with ... supporters and craftsman from the region
Reconstruction begun in 1996 and was also supported by DRYMAT.
This has deffinetly helped to reduce humidity enormusly not only in the room air but also in the walls.
It is checked continously the humidity value being determined and we were quite amazed to see such an effect
You know we have already tried all kind of methods.
"We have drilled holes, put injections into the walls, and kept renewing the ..."
And at that time the water really run down the walls in ...
Everything we did was useless
So this is the only method which has really been helpfull for us.
And it is persievable.
Visitors who come into our church often say that the air has improved considerably.
Finally the church where JSB got married could be preserved thanks to the supporters who spent countless hours working here after work and the weekends.
Thanks to the many donations made by ... supporters from all over the world
And thanks to DRYMAT.

The semantics of relational logic is not by itself to tell us which terms are equal and which are not.
"In fact, it's possible for every term to refer to a distinct object in the real world and it's possible for every term to refer to the same object."
"Well, the semantics relational logic does not constrain your quality relation."
The idea of coreferentiality does.
"For example, it's not possible for us to believe a=b and b=c and at the same time, not believe a=c."
We can capture these constraints through axioms.
I already mentioned a few cities that we are actively working with.
But there are so many more that we could and will be working with.
"So again, just to illustrate my point, here is a snapshot from Google Analytics that shows the geography of visitors to the webpage of my institution."
"And it's really not a webpage on which you can bump, it's not advertised, you really have to look for it."
So people who have found it have some interest in the same things that I'm interested in.

Good morning.
I'm going to tell a story.
I think I need a piece of technology here.
Thank you.
Now I just have to figure this out.
"I'm going to tell a story about -- ecology, which is a story of plants and their parasites."
"If you'd like to take a look at one of the parasites, you and I do every morning when we look in the mirror."
(Laughter)
"This story is literally the flow of energy and there happens to be one exquisite transducer, the land plant."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"And I'm not one of the people from Australia, either."
(Laughter)
"That story is literally better told by another set of constructs which is basically the cycles that make life possible, because life is made of the same materials."
"You and I have the same molecules that were in Plato, were in the dinosaurs, were in literally the first blue-green algae, as they emerged 3.5 billion years ago on Earth."

The congressional staff.
The staffers on the house ways and means committee really hated this.
Why did they really hate it?
[inaudible] in the heat but every time they're going to consider changing the Medicare law or the.
Right?
They didn't have power.
"They've got either the device people or the doctors, or the hospitals, or the drug companies, or the patients, everyone [inaudible] arguing why the opposition is right."
They have a lot of power.

They're n obody.
They really hated this.
"Those staffers, they went berserk."

What does that blow it?
Democrats aren't interested in.
"Now, reforms stand along and they get enough for it."
So.
The ambition of project Velocar match one of the great stakes of our time : sustainability of our mobility.
"Before the end of this decade our big, fat and oiled powered cars will inevitably have to be reinvented."
"That's fortunate, we are not alone thinking this way."
"You may have heard of the recent Twizy, a two seated electric micro-car."
"And well before this, the velomobiles with their simple yet clever idea : get rid of you car problem, by replacing it, with you bike !"
"In practice, a Velomobile is an aeroshell that sits on top of a trike to help you brave wind, cold and rain on your everyday rides."
URLs.
These URLs were created by things like different types of navigation.
"So Googlebot, in terms of crawling your site, doesn't just look at, say, 200 unique URLs."
"But actually has to determine which URLs to crawl of the 380,000 that were created."
You can see how
Googlebot might want to be more efficient in crawling by looking at these two URLs.
"Now, the first one says, ""category equals YouTube."" Let's say that URL to 20 unique items on the page."
"But on the second URL, it's ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."" So it's the exact same items."
"But now just say, filtered down to five."
"Because of the ""size equals medium"" parameter."
So in this way Google would rather just crawl the first URL and reach all 20 of the items.
Rather than crawling both URLs and seeing a redundant five items.
"Essentially, with your input in URL parameters, it helps us to understand your site better."
So we can crawl more efficiently.
"By crawling more efficiently, we don't crawl as many duplicates."
And that will save you bandwidth.
And helps us to focus on your unique content.
Rather than crawling the duplicate of information repeatedly.
"But if you want URLs removed, you can go to URL Removals in Webmaster Tools."
"Again, the URL parameters feature is to crawl more efficiently."
It's not about removals or explicit robots.txt disallowing.
Another background piece of information that I'd like to mention is that page-level markup is still taken into consideration in tandem with URL parameters.
So if you have page-level markup.
"Like rel, ""canonical"", or rel, ""next"" ""prev"", or rel, ""hreflang"", that's fine and can still be used by Google."
Even if you are using URL parameters.
Just make sure that we can still crawl your page.
Meaning that it's not robots.txt disallowed.
Or you haven't set it to not be crawled in URL parameters.
"As long as we can crawl your page, we can still use the page-level markup."
"Since we've covered the background information, let's now talk about the types of URLs that are eligible for this feature."
Here's one from the Google store.
"It says, ""category equals office."" Other URLs would be things like ""category equals wearables"" or ""category equals wearables and size equals medium."""
"Then, we have cluster computing, which is, the common thing is, like Google, gigantic warehouse, and buys a 100,000 of the same computer, and puts it altogether, and houses it altogether, and that's called a cluster."
And all the computers work together to do whatever you need them to.
"Cool? side note, personally, this isn't on Dan's lectures, this is mine. my definition cloud computing."
"Google has its own cluster, its own cluster of machines, but they don't always use all these computers."
"Sometimes, a lot of them are idle like in Christmas break, people are searching more, so they need more machines, but over the summer that people are searching less they still have the machines."
"So, what do they do with them?"
"Well, came out the idea of the cloud that you can rent out these computers for whatever services other people need."
And it's just opens up a world of possibilities.
"The ideas that because these computers are for you to use, you get to them over the internet, and you can get to them over the internet from your phone, computer,"
"laptop, anywhere anytime."
"And this just opens the possibilities everywhere, but it's not actually that much of a new technology."
"It's just like, oh, a new way to use the Internet and the computer we already have."
"It's pretty cool, but it's just very applicable and really nice."
Awesome.
"So, the five parts of the computer."
[INAUDlBLE] is tower.
A computers are usually split into five parts.
"The first being the processor, which has the control, the brain which actually does the work and the datapath which shares the wires that connects the different part of the brain."
"And, then there's the memory, which is the storage, both long term, short term, anything."
"Registers, caches, hard drive, whatever you can think is part of the memory."
"And then, there are the devices, the inputs and outputs."
"Keyboard, mouse, monitor, whatever you need."
"This is called, well, we'll get to that in a moment."
This is called the Von Neumann
Architecture.
"And you should know John von Neumann, I believe in the 60's, he came up with this architecture and he's a famous guy."
"John von Neumann came up with this architecture and is still used today, decaed and daecades later, and he's pretty famous."
You should know him.
He maybe tested on.
Awesome.
So what's inside the processor? we're back on hopefully.
"There is the processor, brain and datapath."
And I'm just going to begin to pass the tube in.
"And I just want to keep passing it down and the patient will swallow, until I get to that mark that told me I was in all the way."
All right.
"Once we've gotten so that we've passed the tube as far as we want to, we've gotten to the mark that we wanted to get to, and we can secure the tube in the patient's nose."
"And there's a couple of ways you can do that, but we'll use kids tape here."
Make a little flag.
Secure that in the patient's nose.
And then I need to check for placement.
"I'm going to add this Lopez value here, at the end."
"It's a stopcock that is designed to go onto, for tube feedings and for naso-gastric tubes."
"So I'll put this on the end of the Levin tube and then I need to, there's a couple ways that I can check that this tube is in the right place."
"I can have this patient x-rayed, to make sure the tube is in the proper place."
I can withdraw some of the gastric contents and check for pH.
Those two are considered the best gold standards.
The x-ray placement and then the pH.
"PH should indicate that it's very acidic, being in the stomach."
The third mechanism of placement is to add some air in here and to listen with a stethoscope to see if you hear a whoosh.
So you can listen here.
That's the third mechanism.
"It's not as accurate, but it is used a lot in many institutions if they don't have the bedside testing."
"So know what your unit protocol is, what your hospital protocol is."
"So this would be the third one, and I would be listening with a stethoscope here and listening to hear a whoosh from the air."
"Once I know, once I have confirmed placement by either pH, x-ray or air sounds, then I'm going to turn the Lopez valve so that I shut off here to the patient so that it doesn't drip out and then until I'm ready for my feeding."
"Now, depending on which type of feeding it is, it can set up a little different."
"If the patient is going to have an intermittent feeding, every so many hours they get so many cc's of fluid, and you administer it all together, I'm going to need an irrigation tray."
"And this, because this tray has a bulb type syringe, I'm actually going to use a catheter tip syringe also."
So I would have gotten that extra.
And then I have my tube feeding that I'm going to use.
Tube feeding.
Okay.
Okay.
"So I'm going to pour my tube feeding in here, whatever the prescribed amount is."
Find operation requires a little more work.
"So let's look at the Implementation, a demo of that one in operation first."
"So again we, we start out the same way but now the idea array entry really means that every one of these things is a little tree where the one node each everyone pointing to itself."
"It's the root of it's own tree so now if we have to put four and three in the same component, then all we do is we take the root, of the component containing the first item and make that a child of the root of the component, component containing the second item."
In this case we just make four as parent three.
So now three and eight.
"So again, we take the first item and make it a child of the root of the tree containing the second item."
"So now three, four, and eight are in the same component."
Six and five six goes below five.
"Nine and four, So now four is the root of the tree containing four is eight."
And the root of tree containing nine is nine.
And so we make nine a child of eight.
"Two and one, that's an easy one."
"Now if we get our, our eight and nine connected, we just checked that they have the same root and they both have the same root eight and so they're connected."
Five and four 4's root is eight.
5's root is five.
They're different.
They're not connected.
Five and zero.
Five goes to be a child of zero.
Seven and two seven goes to be a child of 2's root which is one.
Six and one.
"6's route is zero 1's its own route, so zero becomes a child of one."
Each one of these union operations just involves changing one entry in the array.
"And finally, seven and three."
"So seven's root is one, three's root is eight, one becomes a child of eight."
Okay and now we have one connected component with all the items together.
"Alright, so now let's look at the code for implementing Quick-union."
The constructor is the same as the other one.
We create the array and then set each element to be it's own root.
"Now we have a private method that implements this process of finding the root by chasing parent pointers until we get to the point where I is equal to ID of I, and if it's not equal, we just move I up one level in the tree, set I equals ID of I and return it."
"So starting at any node, you just follow ID equals ID of I until they're equal and then you're at a root and that's a private method that we can use to implement the find operation or the connected operation."
That's been mainly the kind of things that I've been able to see since having children.
"I love to go to carnival, because I'm really involved in that"
I love going to the pictures and I like to go and watch plays
"I have two grandsons and my daughter makes us go everywhere we go to the farm, we go everywhere that's cheap to the Science Museum, wherever we can get in for free."
"Because, she sits down and searches the internet like anthing to find events that are going on in London for free."
"As long as I can be entertained, I'm not really fussed."
I don't go to the pictures as much but I do prefer to watch a play especially young people that are not famous
"I like to go and watch things that I know other people's children are going to be in it, just to see how it is."
"I love sports, so anything to do with sports is for me so I spend most of my time trying to find out where the next football action is on or who is doing what in the parks, in cycling and so on."
"Hackney's great, in the summer time there's no borough in London I believe that can beat them"
"They have old fairs, book fairs, craft fairs, charity do's they're very organic, they have recycling stuff and so on."
"I'm looking forward to Spring, Summer coming on."
"That is one of the main things, free events,"
I went to the Science Museum the other day
I'm going to back through and try and look back at the stuff I went to.
"I did go out of Hackney recently to the fun fairs the old fashioned kind of Gerry Cottle circus, so that's what I've done with the little guy."
SARAH LEE:
"Our next speaker now, which is Jim Tucker."
"Jim is Head of Journalism down at Whitireia Journalism School, down in Wellington, and I had the pleasure of catching up with Jim"
"last week, and being shown around, and it's a very impressive, modern campus."
"So yes, without further ado, welcome, Jim."
[applause]
JlM TUCKER:
"Thanks very much, Sarah."
I've had to put the pencil through some of what I've written after hearing some of the things that Jane has said.
"For instance, I had this very well-founded theory that if you could reenact a suicide on a soap opera on television that that would have much more potential for harm than, my words here are, the second- and third-hand accounts of officials and those known to a suicide victim."
"But she's just proven that wrong, so that's been excised."
"Tēnā koe, George."
Thank you for your welcome.
I now acknowledge some of my colleagues from the media:
"John Roughan from the Herald down here,"
"Jonathan Marshall from Sunday News,"
"July 23, Stiles spent the day writing diplomas onto parchment."
[laughs]
"'Yeah, I know this is a little taxing."
I've still got students and they still have to graduate so
I'm going to write out their diplomas'--which I think is really kind of striking.
Okay.
Let's turn back for a minute to look at precisely what happened as the British invaded New Haven.
"Apparently, they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of Washington's troops away from White Plains,"
"New York, where I guess they were, and that was I guess a strong position to hold, so the British thought well, if they attack the Connecticut shore, they'll entice Washington to send some of his troops to"
Connecticut and that way maybe they can defeat them on both fronts.
"And New Haven ends up being the first target in this plan, so on July 5 the British debark in New Haven Harbor."
They had about two thousand soldiers.
One part of the troops was going to enter New Haven from
East Haven and the other part was going to enter from West
Haven.
"Stiles wrote in his diary, ""Perhaps one-third of the adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to meet them."
"A quarter removed out of town doing nothing, the rest remained unmoved, partly Tories, partly timid Whigs,"" and then he adds that some of the Tories armed themselves and then went out to fight with the"
British.
"That's a great example of how our--I think our impulse is to say, 'Well, the people were united in unity against the"
British.'
"It's like--well, no."
The entire town wasn't a big lump--a big lump of rebels.
"It was people with different ideas, and you just--Stiles in that one little sentence--"
"He has people going to fight with the British, people going to fight against the British."
"He has people sort of not knowing what to do and kind of just staying in town and then people not wanting to do anything, just wanted to get themselves out of there-- all sort of happening at the same time."
"People are making decisions, some pretty dramatic decisions, and they're having to make them spur of the moment, and you can see them in a lot of cases here taking a side, taking a formal side in a way that could have pretty dire consequences."
"Yale immediately was dismissed, and some students immediately ran for home."
"Supposedly, according to a diary, one student, a sophomore, instead of going home decided to go to a nearby town and read Blackstone's"
Commentaries.
Why that made sense I don't know.
"'What, the British are coming?"
I think I'll go to Fairfield and read Blackstone now.'
Strong force.
All right.
"The weak and the strong forces here, these are intranuclear forces within the nucleus."
That's what keeps the protons and neutrons and the quarks together.
"For the most part, the weak and the strong force don't have an effect in chemistry, with the exception for beta decay, for some radioactive elements."
"That's where you need to think about, in particular, the weak force."
"Gravity also -- Well, gravity actually has no known consequence for chemistry."
"It doesn't mean that there isn't one, but it has no known consequence for chemistry."
"All of chemistry is tied up in this force, the electromagnetic force."
"Now, what I am going to do is I am going to simplify it just a little bit and just call this the Coulomb force."
And why I am going to do that is going to be a little more obvious when you get to 8.02.
But I am going to call it the Coulomb interaction.
And we know what the Coulomb force law looks like.
The Coulomb force law is the following.
"Say I have a positive charge, which is my nucleus."
I am going to call that force plus e.
"And at some distance R, R is the distance now, between that nucleus and the negatively charged particle, which is my electron."
I can describe the force of attraction between this electron in the nucleus by the following expression.
"That force, which is a function of the distance between the two charges, is just the magnitude of the charge on the negatively charged particle times the magnitude on the positively charged particle over 4 pi epsilon nought r squared."
"Now, I am going to treat this force, just for simplicity purposes right now, as a scalar."
"I am not going to talk about the direction, but because this is a force between a positive and negative charge, this is an attractive force."
This epsilon down here is the permittivity of the vacuum.
It is in there for doing our unit conversion correctly.
That is all I will say about it.
Maybe you will talk a little bit more about it in 8.02.
"And then, finally, here is the r squared."
That is the important part.
That is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
And what I want you to notice here-- I don't need the screen down yet.
Hello.
She just switched it?
"Oh, all right."
People fixed this with something called Time Division Multiplexing and there are
"lots of different algorithms for how to do this but the idea is that the computer is so fast it can jump, it can spend some time on one thread, jump to the second, jump to the third, and then come back to the fourth and as the user we don't see the difference."
"That said, eh, yeah."
And this multithreading has been around for decades too because we can do this.
"Okay, so there are some issues with using parallel programing."
In parallel programing when you write parallel programing you run into a lot more troubles than just writing serial code.
What kinds of troubles?
"Well first thing, you have to think how to divide the problem up so that you can run it in parallel because some, some problems aren't as easy."
"It's called embarrassingly parallelized, like I said the list of 100 that you just send 50 this way and send 50 the other way."
Some problems just aren't that easy to parallelize.
Some problems can't be parallelized.
"And then you have to, there's time to hand out work to different workers."
"Eh, what does this mean?"
"We want, need to send the data around between the different cores."
"All the workers, each computer doesn't always work as fast."
Especially when you work in cluster and cloud computing.
"Each computer, some computers die, some computers are slower, some computers fail."
It happens.
You have to deal with it.
"Eh, there may be contention for shared resources."
"If you try to use the list you can't be changing it all the time because you might get problems, and we'll talk about that in five minutes."
Workers could be overwriting each others answers.
That's the idea.
"You have to wait for the last, slowest worker to come back."
And this is the weakest link.
And there's time to put the data together after you've done all the parallel parts.
"Specifically, in lab this week we're going to have a compitition."
"Ooo, fun."
We're going to see how fast you guys can sort a shuffled deck of cards.
We'll have a classwide compitition and you'll actually tackle all these problems.
"So let's say, time to hand out small work"" units"" to workers, you have to maybe pass out cards between each other."
Some of you sort slower than others and we'll see how it works.
Two of the victims were former members of the Auburn University football team.
Auburn police chief Tommy Dawson announced the deaths.
"""It's sickening that these young lives were cut short, and, and also the shooter is such a young man."
"As a society, we've got to learn the value of life again."
"If I could bring them back today to their parents, I would."
"Fortunately, I can't do that."
"And to the parents and families of these victims, I am very sorry."
"Please let it be known, we are grieving with you"
"In other gun violence nationwide, four people were killed in an apparent gang-related shooting in Sacramento on Sunday and four people died when a father in California's Fresno County killed his wife and two children before taking his own life"
And a group of Latin musicians has won a campaign for the Grammy Awards to reinstate the category of Best Latin jazz album following its elimination last year.
Latin jazz was among dozens of ethnic music award categories cut from the annual event by the Recording Academy in a controversial move.
"Last August, four Latin jazz artists filed a lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court claiming that the dropping of such categories had adversely affected their careers."
"The suit was dismissed in April, but after continued campaigning the Recording Academy announced the award's reinstatement on Friday."
"Hello, my name is Karen Peltz Strauss."
I grew up in NY
I have a family of three boys and one husband.
"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig."
It's only a couple dozen square miles.
It's in the Rockies.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
"My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple."
"I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question."
"And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people, for one day in their life."
The job in question: herding sheep.
Great.
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
"So, normally, I never do any research at all."
"But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals."
"So I called the Humane Society and I say, ""Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,"
"Can you tell me the deal?"""
"And they're like, ""Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."""
"They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller."
And you might want to connect with others to do further explorations around some of those ideas.
And do you want to add to that Natalie?
Natalie:
"Well just that Fred also had something online, something that he shared some failures of the past and the class inspired him to go back and try it again."
So if theres something that you had tried before and put aside but you want to pull it out of that file cabinet and try another version.
"Or that someone did out in the community, they were recalling some amazing project they had done in a housing project."
And if that can inspire other people.
So either with other people or your own project.
Mitch:
"I think its very much in the spirit of learning spiral that we introduced right in the beginning of class, this idea of continually iterating."
"And week to week we aren't giving you so much time to iterate so the diving deeper really gives you an opportunity to iterate on some of the things you got started with, some of the weekly assignments or readings or discussions."
So hopefully you'll get a chance to get started on that over the next few weeks along with doing some of the readings about tinkering and doing your own tinkering with some of the suggested activities.
And then we'll come back three weeks from now on April 29th to explore more fully the idea of tinkering in the next session of Learning Creative Learning.
Thanks a lot.
Natalie:
Bye Mitch:
"Bye, bye."
"But now it's Bach, so I won't confuse you."
That was only a snippet of Chaconne by Bach.
A song I play at many classical concerts.
What music do you actually listen to?
Melodious.
What does that mean?
That every genre in the world is a gift from God.
It's just not that everyone are good representatives of it.
"When you listen to rap, for example, then you  most likely listen to Eminem or ""Klovner i kamp"" because when good rap exists why listen to bad rap?"
When you listen to country you listen to Willie Nelson.
"It's, of course, everyone is allowed to try but it would be better if there only were good examples for every genre."
"So there would not be criticism like ""Oh, you're stupid because you listen to rock"""
What do you put highest of all Norwegian music?
You once said you'd like to play Ole Bull.
"Well, yeah, you just answered the question."
And going to college.
Just whoever was - There never seemed to be any shortage of people that could play.
Somebody played an accordion.
I can't remember who that was.
What did Walter McCauley play?
Guitar.
Did he sing?
I'm not sure.
Who were the singers?
Rita was one of them.
Rita?
Jules's wife.
Mary's mother.
I'm not sure.
"Oh, Loraine would get up - every once in a while she'd get up and do the tap dance thing and all this kind of stuff."
That would be entertaining more than a singer as far as...
I didn't ask the question.
I didn't take that risk because of being concerned about that my question is going to appear stupid.
"And learning about our own tendencies and understanding how certain situations may interfere with our other goals of actually learning and developing is very important in our self knowledge and in our ability to regulate our own motivation and say, I recognize this in me, I can see how this is holding me back and I'm going to regulate my emotions and shift my goal."
Or consciously adopt a learning goal orientation in order to pursue learning.
And part of the process that allows this to happen is what Ricarose is doing which is engaging people in conversation.
"How did you feel about this, what did it make you do and how would you cope with this and learning from each other and recruiting the community and supporting you in regulating your own motivation."
Natalie:
And we do it in a genuine way because we want to understand and then that gets them reflecting.
I've seen that also in this after school program with the University of illinois in Urbana-
"Champagne, part of a project called the Pathways Project where we're interviewing young people and staff in a variety of after school programs."
And asking young people to reflect on some project they've worked on over a period of time.
And through the interviews you start to see that they start to realize some things.
"Like they were preparing for a presentation, some of them said, I was going to do anything to get out of this situation."
"But because of their team, they didn't want to let their teammates down, they went and then they realized, oh actually it wasn't so bad."
"So these multiple experiences of working on projects and then having questions where you reflect back, like what did you think it was going to be, how was it?"
"And a lot of them are finding, oh actually now I want to do more of that."
Ole:
"I think thats true and in many ways thay actually realized an ideal life in relation to the cultural and there have been lots of them who have been talented musicians, I can promise you and painters ... christ what is this all about, right? and they didn't have to be professional cause to be proffesional's a compulsion right?"
"If you have enough money, you can always grow it as an amateur, in German called ""Lieb haber"" someone who does something because he enjoys it"
Martin:
"""Amo"" does mean ""I love"""
Ole:
Yes thats true
Martin:
"So if I have to pick up on your totalitarian leadership of the world, if we are to achieve it all before the crisis ..."
We need small units and within the small units we could make a cultural revival we could institutionalize one in any case and then hope that rises a culture in light of the disaster which might also be repentance and then the music very well could play a larger role in the formation project but also as quality of life
Ole:
"Yes, Community Project"
Martin:
Community Project yes.
What else could be included?
Ole:
"Also painting, I think."
Children are phenomenal painters .. many of them have a sense of color that is ever so good
Arts's a way where people generally don't have to harm each other when unfolding
And I think limited sports can be too when it doesn't mean that you have to be wonderful
Martin:
"There's also some sports that potentially could be artistic but thats still about who can make the most twists in the air and jump highest and things like that, right?"
"So that has also been taken out of the artistic of those who potentially had it, perhaps?"
Ole:
"I remember that long ago I read, that in Brazil were a tribe they played out on the criterion that it was important to get the other team to win"
It can of course be a good sport but I like that way of thinking
Martin:
So the competition culture does not benefit anything at the moment?
Ole:
"No, I do not think it has benefited anyone anything ever"
Martin:
But you could say that this Greek way of compeeding to the arts might have helped them become so good? or helped them become so good in so little time.. thats what some thinks..
"G can get to F in two steps, and that's an improvement because before the best we could get to F was 11 steps."
"Now, we can get to F in ten."
Can we get anywhere else new?
"No, cause the only nodes that are complete now are B and F, and they're already in the picture, and in fact, now we see that the fastest way to get to F is going to be in ten steps cause the only other way to get to F that we haven't considered is getting there through B, and that's going to be longer."
We can lock this down.
Alright!
"So, let's look at F."
"What edges are coming at F to uncompleted nodes, just this one to B."
That would have been F is ten steps plus one more would be 11 to get to B.
"That's an improvement over what we had before, and that's it for F."
"Now, the only node that we've got left to think about is B."
There's no way to get to be any faster than 11 cause there's no other place that we can go and then get to B.
"We can lock it down, and that finishes the picture."
We now know what the shortest distance is from A to === in the graph.
The distance to B is 11.
"Now, we've kind of lost a little bit of information of how we get to B in 11?"
"But, we'll deal with that in a little bit."
Good morning to everyone and above all to our guests.
"A warm "" thank you"" to Mrs Di Ture who represents the General Direction of our Education Department."
"I myself thank you because I don't have any merit for this event, I am only doing my work according to the general political and administrative lines of our Institute , which I consider more useful for our students."
"This activity was led by Mrs Calò and a starting group of Section A classes infact I think that this first step was made by our V A and to them, to these students our thanks must be given for what they have made and for what other students will be able to do on their example"
Let's look at multiplying binomials.
"For example, if we want to multiply (2x+5y) (3x-y), we could take this entire binomial here and distribute it to each of these two terms, which would give us (2x+5y) (3x) + (2x+5y) (-y)."
"And again, we can distribute this 3x to these two terms, as well as the -y to these two terms, which gives us (2x) (3x) + (5y) (3x) + (2x) (-y) + (5y) (-y) = 6x^2 + 15yx - 2xy - 5y^2."
"And now, 15yx and -2xy are like terms because yx and xy are equal by commutativity."
"So we can combine them, which gives us our answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"Now, this type of multiplication comes up often and there is an acronym used to describe it."
And the acronym is FOlL.
"The F in FOlL stands for First, which means we multiply the first terms in each binomial."
"So, a * c."
"The O stands for Outer, which means we multiply the outer terms in the two binomials, so a * d."
"The I stands for Inner, which means we multiply the inner terms of the two binomials, so b * c."
How we experienced it.
"The first international perception of the 15M was on the 18th or 19th, I can't remember the dates when we got a message from Egypt through a co-worker at Periodismo Humano, Olga Rodríguez."
It was from the revolutionary commission of Egypt- that's not the right name but you understand- supporting what was happening in Sol.
I remember talking to Olga about publishing it but we had to talk to the people in the Puerta del Sol first.
So they knew they had support.
ST:
"There was a problem with one of the words in that, wasn't there?"
JL:
"Yes, in the message we got from Egypt supporting the 15M, in the headline they wrote of their support to Democracia Real Ya."
"So of course, they were already talking about whether Democracia Real Ya was part of the camp, who was who... it was all very sensitive."
And I remember asking Olga if she knew who was who.
"So we explained it to them and they said OK, let's make it as broad as possible, and they changed the message and made it extensive to all the 15M."
"We didn't consider ourselves the writers of the message, we simply asked what they meant and we advised them a little about what it was all about."
"It was all so incipient, there were so many debates, it was logical that something like that should happen."
That was the first international perception we had.
"Parallel to that, you spend 12 or 15 hours in a doorway telling stories, trying to find the humane side to things, working on reports..."
"In all, doing high quality journalism and suddenly you go up to a roof on the 17th, and the man there wants to charge you for taking a photo from the balcony and you give it little importance saying it's just a mobile, and you go to the balcony and make a 40 second video."
"You publish it on the internet, because there's 3G coverage up there, and after you put it on youtube it becomes the most seen video of the month in the political news category."
And in a few hours you have hundred of thousands of reproductions.
And suddenly they tell me that the video's on the website of the New York Times.
And then in the Washington Post.
"And on BoingBoing, one of the most read blogs in English in the world."
And then more media.
And front pages... it's something...
"We were the first source of information on the 15M for the New York Times and the Washington Post, the first text they produced was a photo of mine of a woman with a non-violence sign, and the panoramic video taken from the balcony with Paz Vega in the background."
"Paz Vega, the involuntary muse of the 15M."
ST:
We shamelessly took advantage of her.
JL:
"That was the second great reaction we noticed, or that I noticed personally."
"From there on, there were radios from France, from Chile, Argentina, Miami..."
Articles in Al Jazeera.
"No way."""
"So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000."
"Using different microsatellites gave the different results, but the mean of all these studies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe."
"But then, I am a skeptic."
"But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals."
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
"So what it tells us, actually, is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small."
"In fact, of those 20,000, 8,000 were thought to be females."
"There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?"
I don't know.
I don't believe it.
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail.
"So, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?"
"Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up."
"We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky."
Another source would be fisheries' bycatch.
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
"That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks."
"And some are caught in nets, in trawls."
"This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas -- illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law -- and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak."
"They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told it was illegal."
They actually did get a fine for that.
"So if you look at all those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86, at present."
"So it's very important work, and they can ask some really good questions, and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure, but they're constrained by lack of samples."
"When we were out tagging our sharks -- this is how we tagged them on the front of a RlB, get in there fast -- occasionally, the sharks do react."
"On one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal, the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in."
And that was fine.
We got wet.
No problem.
"And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,"
I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
"We cannot make energy saving window without toxic materials in it, otherwise it doesn't work."
"So, this means to reinvent our materials to go into technical cycles."
"So, we now make washing machines where you can wash just 3000 times."
"We now make materials which can go into technical cycles, and biological cycles."
But this means reinventing  everything you see in front of you.
"We don't need to say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry to be here."""
"We can say, ""Hey, we are not good enough."
"Our design is not good enough  because it makes toxic waste."""
"Now, we try to minimize our footprint but we reach the opposite"
"We are making the wrong thing perfect, and by that, they are perfectly wrong."
"When we send these things to recycling, we only contaminate the biological system."
Because it was never designed for recycling.
"The design that you do is so important, but right now this design is amazingly primitive."
"Look, I became a designer."
"You can see when you look in the internet, you find I'm designing materials,"
"I'm designing materials like washing machines that only do five thousand loads of washing,"
But this is because the designers don't do their job.
I'm designing edible fabrics.
What we do see here?
"Stinking PVC, never designed for human beings."
Destroying fertility.
The whole system is very primitive.
That means that we need to reinvent all our materials again.
This is the amount of diapers which one baby makes in one year.
"In Europe, 20% of all waste stream in households are diapers."
"And, because they get older, the diapers get bigger."
There is some potential in it.
"A baby takes about 7,500 diapers."
"If we could make diapers for babies, which allow them to go into biological systems, if we change the soap absorbents and the plastics, we could grow with one baby,  150 trees, just with one baby."
So this baby could be carbon positive from the beginning.
"It's really carbon positive, not carbon neutral."
"With learning how to use the sun, we can reinvent everything to go back into technical systems and biological systems."
"So we've chosen the things that sort of solved the most complexity like being able to send an SMS with one click, being able to navigate some of it with one click."
"There's one that I didn't demonstrate, which I use, like, ten times a day, which is to say, ""Note to self,"" and then, you know, ""Buy milk on the way home,"" or whatever reminder you want to send yourself."
"I'm sure many of you geeks here send yourself emails all the time, trying a reminder."
So we're trying to solve the biggest problems before we try to voice-enable everything.
"The next step, by the way, is to actually open the voice actions platform with a public API so that third party developers can then start adding different actions to do anything, right?"
"So, Spotify, for example, could say, ""Well, it's great that a user can launch Spotify and play a song or a playlist, but what about controlling the playback?"" You know, ""What about being able to say 'pause' and other thing like that?"""
"So we're going to open up the voice actions API for that stuff, and all of these actually are doable today because there's an open API on Android itself for speech."
Hopefully that answered that question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
I'm looking forward to that.
"And the second question is to--I'm sorry, the second question is to Eric."
"Now, Google TV is one of the best of product from Google, right?"
Okay?
What's your strategy to get Google
"TV into China market, because I'm a Chinese, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Well, our current strategy is to try to get it."
"Because of the partnership you saw, it has to be integrated with the content provider."
"We're trying to get it launched in the next couple of months in United States, and then we'll do a worldwide launch later or basically in 2011."
"And I won't go through the details on a per-country basis, but it's pretty obvious what we need to do."
"We need to talk to the broadcasters and make sure we have the content, get the thing certified."
"Televisions are, in fact, offered by the local manufacturers."
They have to actually install the software in their televisions.
"Go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dr. Schmidt, I'm really sorry, but I've Googled your schedule, you only have time for one more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
One more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And please try and keep it to one question.
"So, anymore?"
I think the gentleman all the way in the back.
If you could stand up and just announce yourself.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; POPl:
"Hello, my name is Luppa Popi from Symantec Eds and my question is, what's your view about Apps?"
Everybody is talking in Apps and Apple has taken this phenomenon to the
last stage.
"And when we talk about Apps in two or three year's time, what will be the mash up use cases from the Apps. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
First is I think the iPad Apps have really shown a very good model.
"But in fact, this man has a wonderful  relationship with the young people because he is completely comfortable with  who he is and he is completely authentic."
"And these young people  feel his authenticity and his authenticity allows them to be their true selves."""
"And that is the most important, not the differences, but the authenticity."
"(Woman in the audience) Hello,"
I work in French and American schools.
"I do intervention, teaching meditation and yoga but I usually talk to the children, not so much to the teachers or bosses of the schools."
"And basically, I am looking for help and maybe resources to know to speech, to talk to teachers of big school."
"People give you some money, basically, to come in to the school."
I am also looking for resources  to translate all the mindfulness that we learn in English in French.
(Inaudible)
(J. Bell) I wonder if anybody in the hall could answer her.
"Raise your hand  if you have some resources and then you could speak to her afterwards, okay?"
(Inaudible)
Someone back there too.
(M. Srinivasan) I also wanted to mention that collaborative academic social  emotional learning has a great resource.
"They have five competencies that  are specific taught sequentially of self awareness, self management,  social awareness, relationship skills and  helping decision making."
"If you just go to www.casel.org, there is a lot of information there including research about improved attention and focus, and students who have social  emotional learning interventions."
The latest report had an increase of 11% top points on testings.
This is all language and information that will be really effective for the administrators too.
"(K. Weare) And also to add, I actually imagine it is very typical."
"The dot-be program in the UK, if you go to it, has a paper  on the evidence based and the curriculum has been translated into French."
"I would imagine if you went  to the Garrison website and looked the various programs there, you would find quite a lot of resources."
There are 37 programs.
"If you start clicking, you will find stuff, I'm sure."
"(M. Srinivasan) Richard suggests that I spell 'casel', it is C-A-S-E-L dot org."
And they also have the evidence based  programs up there and research as well.
"(K. Weare) It is in the UK, it is called the Mindfulness in Schools Program."
There is free download of a paper only evidence-based from mindfulness in school.
"It is just called Mindfulness in Schools, if you put UK, you'll find it, and it's called .b which  is a full-stop with the small 'b'."
"It means basically stop and breathe or stop and be, that's its logo."
But I think the Garrison will also  have some evidence-based papers.
"So, there are quite a lot around  if you start google-ing."
So let's say that you are going to make $100 down payment on an item then you are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months.
Okay?
"So, if we are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months that means we are going to pay $2,400."
Does that make sence?
"Because we would take the $100 times 24 months, which would give us $2,400."
"We have already paid $100 down so that makes it $2,500 that we have paid for the item if we pay it over a 24 month period."
"So, in other words, if it takes us two years to pay for it."
"If we would have paid cash for it in this particular case, we would have paid $2,200."
So what you have to consider is it worth $300 to finance it over the next 24 months versus putting that $100 a month in a savings account for the next 24 months and just paying cash for the item.
"And, if I wait the 24 months then hopefully it might cost the same thing."
"Will it cost the same thing, the 2,200 instead of me having to pay the $2,500 it would cost to finance it?"
And that is something you need to look at before you make a major purchase if you don't have the cash for that purchase.
So one of the things that I want you to think about.
"Lets, look at the chapter."
This chapter looks at practical buying strategies and talks about some different things you need to think about before you actually buy.
One of those things is time and purchases.
There are good times to buy cars and there are bad times to buy cars.
There are good times to buy new TV's and there are bad times to buy new TV's.
"So, this gives you some ideas and some suggestions on what you need to do."
"Another thing that you need to make sure to do, try not to get too emotional with what you are buying."
A lot of times we go to the car lot and we find this car and we are just so..That is The vehicle that I have to have!
If you have that in mind.
"If you know that nothing else is going to meet your needs then it is going to be very, very hard to negotiate on that vehicle."
"So, you have to have a back-up plan."
"You have to say, Okay that is the car I really, really want, but if I don't get it that's okay because I found this other one that I am willing to take."
"So, then you have negotiating power."
"And I will tell you, when you go to buy a car, they are going to use it."
Have you ever!
This has never happened.
I have never gone to buy a car that I wasn't told someone else is looking at it.
"You know isn't it kind of funny that you have been watching that car for two or three months or maybe six months and the day you decide to go try it out and drive it, someone else is looking at it and is probably going to buy it before the day is over."
It's a marketing strategy!
"So what we're going to look at is a real simplification kind of taking that problem, kind of distilling it down to its essences and looking at just six operations that are kind of at the core of any text editor about moving the cursor forward and backwards with these commands."
Jumping to the front and the back of the entire buffer and then inserting and deleting in relative to the cursor within that buffer.
And we're going to do this with an extremely old school interface that's actually command base.
It's like VI comes back from the dead for those of you who have ever heard of such things as VI and E Max.
"And so we're going to look at this because there's actually a lot of ways you can approach that, that take advantage of some of the things that we've already built like the vector, and stacking queue, and the link list."
And sort of think about what kind of options play out well.
What I'm going to show you first off is just what the tool looks like so you can really feel schooled in the old way of doing things.
"So I insert the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, G into the editor."
And then I can use the command B to backup.
"I can use the command J to jump to the beginning, E to jump to the end, and so F and B,"
"B moving me backwards, F moving me forwards, and then once I'm at a place, let's say I jump to the end, I can insert Z, Z,"
"Y, X here at the beginning and it'll slide things over, and then I can delete characters shuffling things down."
So that's what we've got.
"Imagine now, it's like building"
Microsoft Word on top of this.
"There's a lot of stuff that goes, you know, between here and there. but it does give you an idea that the kind of core data requirements every word processor needs some tool like this some abstraction underneath it to manage the character data."
Okay.
Where do we start?
Where do we start?
Anyone want to propose an implementation.
What's the easiest thing to do?
[Inaudible].
In a way.
Something like that.
"You know, and if you think Array, then you should immediately think after it, no, I don't want to deal with Array, I want a vector."
I'd like a vector.
Vector please.
Right.
"So I'm going to show you what the interface looks like, here, that we have a buffer in these six operations."
"We're going to think about what the private part looks like, and we say, what about vector."
"Vector handles big, you know, chunky things indexed by slots."
That might be a good idea.
"The stars and the sun are fixed to the dome, and this dome rotates around."
The earth is at the center.
It's flat.
"It's got corners, according to the bible."
Hell is somewhere below the earth.
Day and night was created before the sun and the earth in Genesis 1:4-5.
"According to biblical scholars like Usher, the age of the universe is somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years."
"Although, they're not quite sure which. and the universe was created by god from nothing, from the void."
"In acutality, in reality, the earth is a planet, one of many in the solar system."
"There is no firmament, no sphere out there."
The sun is the center of the solar system.
The sun is a star on the spiral arm of a typical galaxy with billions of stars.
"The Milky Way is a galaxy, one of billions in the universe."
The age of the universe is 13.
"75 billion years, and the universe was created by natural processes from a singularity, as far as we know."
"So, lots of wrong here."
Lots of screwed up cosmology.
"Aristophanes, back in 2000 BCE, measured the size of the earth."
"He knew is was a sphere, and he measured the angle of the axial tilt."
"So, that's pretty impressive."
"Galileo upset the incorrect church's view using observational astronomy in the 1600s, and pointed out the foolishness of the church's position."
The church was not too happy about people using telescopes because they thought they were going to look up the skirt of god or something.
"Poor Galileo spent most of the rest of his life under house arrest, after that little episode, under fear of being killed."
"There's a long list of astronomers and others who have expanded and refined our understanding of the universe, and they continue to do so today."
"So, meanwhile, the church and the bible has contributed nothing."
"Yet, they're happy to claim credit."
"They say god did it, or whatever, and there's this notion of the god of the gaps, where, if there's something that's not known, well, that's a good place to stick, that's a god-shaped hole to stick god in there, and that explains it."
"But, as we learn more, that gap gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and it's really just an argument from ignorance."
"For other physical sciences, let's talk about lightning, rainbows and materials."
"Okay, lightning."
The chrisitan view up until the 18th century was
lightning was the wrath of god.
"I'm going to print out each word that's in small_words applied to ""The quick brown fox."""
I'm just sort of eyeballing it.
"""The"" and ""fox"" are at most 3 letters, so I hope to see these 2 in the answer, but ""quick"" and ""brown"" are too big to make the final cut, and that's exactly what we got out."
Recall that our goal was to enumerate all the strings in a grammar.
That was our super slow approach to check and see if HTML or JavaScript was valid.
"Well, unsurprisingly, these generators are the trick we're going to use to enumerate a lot of strings in a concise manner."
"All right, let's go through the possible answers together."
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.
"By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us, it's just the string 1368."
"But we're going to convert it to an integer using this cast or conversion here, so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368."
It's not going to be the string 1368 because we have this special conversion.
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule means that we're not going to match just one.
We match all 4 digits.
"Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368."
It's also not going to be the empty string.
"We definitely match 1368, and 1368 is a good number to match."
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.
"They featured a strong central government in China, but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty."
This is my Great Wall sketch.
"You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says ""Great Wall."""
"Cranial nerves IX and X, which are the Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerves, mediate the sensory and motor functions of the palate, pharynx, and larynx."
Practitioner:
I'd like to take a look at the back of your throat.
Can you open your mouth?
[fades]
"To test these nerves, ask the patient to say,"
"""Aaaah,"" or yawn as you observe the soft palate and the uvula."
"The soft palate should rise promptly and symmetrically, and the uvula should remain midline."
"Next, test the gag reflex, one side at a time."
"Using a tongue blade, touch one side of the pharynx, then the other."
"You should see a prompt rise of the palate, and other signs of gagging."
"X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do that is that organize them like date and time and course and what not."
"And so whenever video editors wrote script, weÃ¢ÂÂd just kind of the programming that you got from here and a little bit previously to do this automatically."
Whenever we record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it automatically and saves the video editors hours of time.
"Okay, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great and I think people once you get a little experience with programming youÃ¢ÂÂil see things like that every day that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing people could be yourself but itÃ¢ÂÂil less often be yourself spending their time doing tedious things that are not fun for humans."
That you could write a few
"lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the end of this class and I think by this point in the class many of you really should be at a level where youÃ¢ÂÂre instead of just solving the problems that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢ÂÂre finding real problems in your life and in your friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit of code."
"So, I hope everyone will be doing that and spreading the value of programming literacy beyond that, beyond just yourself."
Second thing we want to talk about building big matrices.
We're gonna build our that big A matrix today and I'm going to teach you how to use.
"Okay, so today, you know, a lot of people use FFTs And there's nothing special about that, they're just means you're a player in the game."
We're gonna learn SP Diags today.
That takes you up a level.
Cuz not a lot of people know that.
"They don't even know what you're talking about and you're like dropping on them,"
"like you don't even know that, yeah."
That's what I walk around doing all day on the ave.
I'm one of those crazy guys.
"And turns out that those dudes don't know SP Diags All right so here's what we are going to do, we're going to make this matrix, and we're going to make it to be."
We're going to chop it up to five points.
In each direction.
"In the x direction five points, Y direction five points."
So our matrix remember is not a five by five.
Remember we're going to restack out data.
It's gonna be five by five times five squared right.
So this is going to be our discretion So that is going to be the size of the matrix we are working with.
Okay.
"So first of all, let's talk about this matrix A. And let's talk about what we want to put in here."
"So first I want, I'm going to make a vector of 1s."
Big vector of ones.
"And what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna make this, what's called the spdiags command."
"And what this is, spdiags, means sparse diagonal."
Diagonals.
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.
"Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message from C, but she could modify it."
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere or something that she wanted to change.
"Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message, change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C."
"It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function."
The decryption of C' would be M'.
"The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M', because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR."
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.
"The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key."
The is this property that the number of possible keys is equal to the number of possible messages.
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.
"Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible."
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space has to be at least as big as the message space i s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
"Let's take a look at an approach for actually finding shortest paths in graphs, and we'll use this example once again."
"It will help to actually have names for the other nodes, so I'm going to add these in."
Just remember what breadth-first search does for this graph starting from A.
We mark A as visited and we add it to the open list.
We pull off the open list and add all the neighbors of A to the open list.
"Letter C, B, and D then we choose one of these nodes,"
"Let's say C and add all its unexpanded neighbors to the graph, but all its neighbors are expanded."
"Do the same thing with B. B has F, and D's unexpanded neighbors are E."
"Now, F's unexpanded neighbors are G, and E has no more unexpanded neighbors."
We finish this step for a search.
"What we get here is that by the assumptions of breadth-first search, the shortest path from A to B is this direct link from A to B."
"The search would have actually terminated here, but we ran that anyway."
These are supposedly the shortest paths in terms of number of hops to all these nodes.
It actually makes sense.
"One hop to C. One hop to B. One hop to D. Two hops to F, sure."
"Two hops to E, sure."
How did we do code review?
How did you earn your authority?
There was nothing quite like it before.
When we started the foundation we remade ourselves over again.
"We were, as I said, a small number of people, we made a bet on a new product that was Firefox."
We didn't have a product to ship at that time.
"And Asa with our community involvement continued to ship the Mozilla suite for fifteen months, as the only product we had in the marketplace until Firefox was ready."
"We made that bet, which is a scary bet."
"Imagine not to have a browser,"
I mean we didn't have a person working on the product we were shipping.
But we did that because we knew that Firefox was our opportunity to make a commercial product.
Our first five or six years of life taught us that technology alone will not change the industry the way we want to.
Technology alone does not change people's lives the way we want to do that.
Our opportunity with the browser is to have a product that touches people.
Yeah.
[Question]
Yeah.
So that's where I'm trying to get to.
"That technology alone is not enough, that raw power of technology is not enough, that if you really want to touch people, not us, not power users, not developers but if you want to touch consumers and change their lives, you have to be utterly committed to that."
You can't build the features that you want just because you want them.
You can't tell people:
"""Oh, you should behave this way, you should want to be this way."""
You have to build the product that is elegant and beautiful and powerful under the covers but that people love.
That was the first thing.
That is a big change.
Many open source projects never make that change.
I started calling it the tyranny of the product.
If you are serious about wanting to touch hundreds of millions of people you have to be committed to those hundreds of millions of people.
"You can't just think they're stupid, or they don't understand."
You have to really be committed to making their lives better.
So that's what Firefox do.
"So we didn't rewrite all these switches, and all the preferences the way our first product had."
"And all that means is that if we see a register being reused, like over here, we have two assignments to the register X. Okay."
"We're just going to introduce another register name, for one of those assignments."
"So in this case I'm just gonna rename the first, use of X here, definition of X here to be some new register B. I'll replace the uses of that"
"X, by the name B, and now I have an equivalent piece of code that satisfies single assignment form."
"Every register is assigned at most, once."
Let's take a look at an optimization that depends on single assignment form.
"So we're going to assume the basic blocks are in single assignment form, and if they are, then we're going to know That a definition of a register is the first use of that register in th e block, And so, in particular, we're also ruling out things like this."
"So there could be something like this, where X is read."
"And then later on, X is used."
Okay.
"Sorry, X is read and then later on, X is defined."
So we're not going to allow this.
"This register here would have to be renamed to something else, say Y, And then uses of X later on here, are renamed to Y. Alright, so we're going to insist that whenever we have a definition Of a register in a basic block."
That is the first use of that register in the block.
"Alright, and if, if that's true, if we main, if we put things in that form, and that's, that's easy to do as we've seen."
"Then when two assignments have the same right hand side, they're guaranteed to compute the same value."
"So, take a look here, This example."
"So let's say we have an assignment, x=y+z."
"And then later on we have another assignment, w=y+z."
And we said that there could only be one assignment to x in any basic blocks.
"So, all of these instructions that are [inaudible] here, they can't be assigning to X. And they also can't be assigning to y and z."
Y and z already have their definitions.
"So, y and z can't be changed."
And that means that x and w here actually compute the same value.
"And so we can replace the second computation Y plus C by just the name that we already have for it X. Okay, and this saves us having to recompute values."
Alright so this is called common sub expression elimination.
Common it's a rather long name.
Sub expression.
The elimination.
"And this is another one of the, more important compiler optimizations."
This is actually something that comes up surprisingly often.
"And saves quite a bit of work if, if you perform this optimization."
We're not going to do it in the US.
It's just too--it's too creepy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
"Okay, Doctor Schmidt. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Is that where you are? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
It's me. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Oh, there you are."
Sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
Okay.
My name is Doctor Shiga.
"Actually, I just picked up the example of the cathedral."
"Actually, you know, you spoke about the organ of the cathedral."
My mother was one of those who have the chance to play this organ. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Ah, good. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I would like to say, when you come back to Berlin we will offer you a concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Oh, thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I say that because I wanted to discuss a topic, which you haven't discussed with us today, but I heard in the grapevine that there is something behind the curtain which may be of interest for us, but it's up to you to spoke about."
It's about generating and retrieving and working out proper memory.
"As you know, all this digital age we're approaching, we speak about the future."
"But I think maybe some of the most important challenges is not just hosting data, but it's not just giving us the data of our actual life, but actually hosting parts of our past."
"And I know that there are some projects in the way in the background of your big, big, big empire which are working on that."
"Maybe it's too early to speak about that, but maybe you can give us at least some ideas about these things which are less on the future which will have to do with our past and once we are done, we give you the concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
"Well first, thank you, sir for such a kind offer."
We're very interested in getting historical information into Google.
"Usually, that historical information is owned by somebody; a library, or a cathedral, or a church, or what have you, and so we have organizations that go and talk to them and try to get that information to be published."
We want to be very respectful of copyright.
We don't want to do it without their permission.
"But most people, when we talk to them, are very interested in getting their information out because it helps popularize what they're doing."
"The more information we have, the more signals, the more information that we can have that we link things together."
I don't think there's anything particularly special about music or sheet music or any of those things.
We have a number of projects around going on a pro bono basis trying to do digital images of the original vellum of recordings from hundreds of years ago.
But our real objective is just to get all the information digitized.

"In the last June 30, numbers of Egyptians went down on the streets of cairo and other cities to protest against the first elected Egyptian president Morsi"
The army interfered and did a coup against Morsi depending claiming that its decision was a respond to the call of the huge number of protesters on the street as army claimed and their numbers varied
Army used a military chopper to take footage for the protests and market it to the media and the world
And the number of the against President Morsi protesters were like stock market exchange
The numbers race (variations) posed mathematical questions before being political
Some used Google Earth to investigate
"Out of the ordinary, Google made a statement to deny all these claims"
"Wael Fakharany, the regional manager of Google said"
"""All the statistics that were cited to Google about the protest in june, 30th or pro president Morsi are fake"" without going into too much mis-claims about the number of protesters"
"Analysts, specialists and some western media websites tried to use the technology of Google Earth"
"Not to count numbers but to measure the area, hence the capacity of the streets and squares to carry the protesters"
"They found that the space of Tahrir square is at most 53,000 square meters"
"Now, the next thing we have to do is that we've got to relate this probability of backscattering."
We are going to have to relate it to the diameter of those nuclei.
How do we do that?
"Well, the probability of a particle backscattering is simply going to be the total area of this crystal, there's our crystal, the total area of this."
"Now, you've got to ignore these aluminum blocks here because this piece of equipment comes from my laboratory."
And I pressed it into service for this demonstration.
This has nothing to do with the demo that we're going to put here.
It's just structural because this is my manipulator puller-outer from our machine.
"So you've got to ignore those, but that whole area there is equal to 2,148 square inches."
And now the probability of that backscattering is this total area of the nuclei to the total area of the crystal.
"And the total area of the nuclei then is just the sum over all nuclei, and there are 119 of them here."
So i=1 to 119 of the area of each one of the nuclei.
"And so that is just 119 times the cross-sectional area of these nuclei actually, which is pi d squared over 4, and this is all over 2,148."
That's the probability.
This is the diameter of the nuclei.
And now I am going to rearrange that and solve for the diameter.
And when I do that I get 4.79 times P to the one half.
"If I measure the probability of backscattering by this, measuring the number of backscattered balls over the total number we throw at it, then I can calculate the diameter of the nuclei, the diameter of those Styrofoam balls."
That is the idea.
"Now, you're going to do this experiment."
And so now the TAs are going to give you all a ping-pong ball or two.
Come on.
We need to distribute the ping-pong balls.
Here's the deal.
What you have to do is you have to aim to hit this lattice.
That's all you've got to do.
"Then you have to watch your ball, and you have to see if it scatters back to you."
"Now, what doesn't count is if you hit these steel bars and it scatters back."
"That doesn't count, okay?"
It also doesn't count if the ball hits the Styrofoam but it continues going in that direction.
Your ping-pong ball has to actually scatter back at you to count.
"And then, when we get all done, I am going to ask whose ball backscattered."
"Masking tape helps protect your car, your buffing pads, and, of course, makes it easier to clean up at the end of the day."
"Now that everything is taped off, it's time to get to work."
Work in two-by-two areas and complete the rest of the car.
"Now that we've compounded, polished and jeweled the paint, the next step is to seal it."
"Apply paint sealant one panel at a time, then remove with a microfiber towel until every painted surface is covered."
"Once cured, the sealant will protect your freshly restored paint and help hide any scratches that were just too deep to safely repair during the correction stage."
"Now we've sealed the car so it looks spectacular, and it's protected."
"Now, if remember back in the previous episodes, we talked about putting Carnauba wax on top, and that's exactly what"
I'm going to do.
"That's going to bring in a pop, that shine back to this paint."
So let's get started.
"The trick here is to add a light, thin layer of Carnauba wax on top of the cured sealant."
"It's possible to do two or three panels before removing the wax with a clean microfiber towel, and the car should take no more than 15 to 20 minutes to get insane depth and shine."
"Although the Porsche took about eight hours or so from start to finish, it was totally worth it."
"Remember, we started off with paint that was completely neglected and in need of some serious correction."
"And after a bit of testing, we managed to restore the paint to near perfection with a safe and easy-to-use machine."
"All right, guys."
"Well, we finally finished this beautiful Porsche Speedster."
"Now, the one thing that we've learned is that you need the right tools."
"You need the right techniques, and a little bit of patience."
"And you, too, can have your car look as amazing as this."
"Now remember, download your free PDF and product guide at ammonyc.com."
"If you have additional questions, shoot me an email or visit my blog for other how-to videos."
"Well, that's it for you guys."

"A bit overwhelmed and actually humbled, with all the faces I see out here today."
You represent a lot of great memories from my family and I.
So stick with me as I kind of fumble through the next few minutes.
"Writing has always been a form of therapy for me,"
"So, today, I welcome you to the congregation of voices that reside in my head."
Might be a scary thought.
"And he has realized that, as a doctor, he has no business being around a mother when she is giving birth."
So he gave up.
Eating fish is not a medical issue.
"However, when a fish bone gets stuck in my throat, then it can become a medical issue."
"By the same token, it's very important that we don't consider a mother who is giving birth to be ill."
The same way I'm not ill when I'm eating a fish.
Psychiatry and obstetrics are two of the most insane fields within the world of medicine.
"All of us and all doctors were once born, so doctors have their traumas."
"And somewhere it's about 'why should children enter life easier, happier and more loved, than I did when I was born?'"
In a way it's about jealousy too.
"'If it was hard for me, why should I make it easier for these children?'"
"It may sound strange, but I'm absolutely certain that it is part of the deal too."
Semmelweis had scientific results.
He didn't have a microscope.
"He didn't see bacteria, he couldn't prove his case, but the patients of those doctors who had washed their hands didn't die."
He saw things very clearly.
"When he felt doctors were the cause of childbed fever, that they became murderers unknowingly with their own unwashed hands as they assisted with births right after performing autopsies He saw it, he knew it."
"But when he mentioned it, he got expelled."
Doctors couldn't dare to imagine and acknowledge that for long years they had been hurting and killing women.
Semmelweis wrote a letter that breaks one's heart when reading it
"He wrote a letter, in which he was begging doctors to stop the old process immediately and he was asking them not to push this opportunity aside just so they wouldn't have to feel guilty."
"This regime, this mentality causes fear."
"Love is a virus when it spreads, but fear is also a virus."
It is a terrible virus.
"I would recommend obstetricians that they stand up immediately, today and say something."
I don't understand what they are waiting for.
What are they risking?
Is it that they would all be expelled with their licenses revoked?
"Agi's colleagues, obstetricians, experts"
Why are they silent?
What are they waiting for?
"Are they waiting for Agi and a few other brave obstetricians to be punished, and then ten years from now they will find their voices?"
"We're gonna start off by playing some kerbals space program then continue to outlast, so join the fun."

"Hello, my name is Maryanne."
And my name is Ashley.
We are seniors here at Western illinois University.
Majoring in Instructional Design and Technology.
"Also, known as IDT."
Something I really enjoy about our majors the opportunity to be working with the latest technology.
"As well as, experience such diverse and unique careers depending on what we want to do and where we want to go."
"In the IDT field you can focus your future working with government, business, health, military or the educational setting."
It really has no limit where you want to extend this career.
IDT involves learning to use technology to effectively design training and educational material.
Did you know that IDT department is just one of the few departments in the nation?
"In fact, we are the only school in the Midwest to offer a bachelors degree in IDT."
"Also, in the Chicago area alone there is 141 job offerings."
Let's talk about what this field can offer for your future career opportunities.
As Maryanne mentioned before the IDT department offers a variety of career opportunities that are diverse.
"You can pursue careers in government, heath, business, military and educational setting."
These are a few companies that our previous graduates had the opportunity to work with.
Our IDT department offers hands-on learning lesson and experiences from highly world dedicated professors.
"Why don't you take a moment to take a look at the IDT see all the different resources, as well as, the two options of study our department has to offer."
I choose the medium web base development option.
The section of study I love the formal based learning with focus of online course development.
And I choose the games and simulation option.
This option of study is a learn by doing approach.
"And died a week after,  because of a respiratory arrest."
"You can imagine that  the TEDx event, last year, was like a limbo to me."
I went on autopilot.
"I have mental images of that day, but actually I have no emotional  recollection of what happened."
There was one person in charge of filming  everything that went on that day and creating a video with  the highlights of the event.
"For some reason, it took him a whole  year to deliver this video and... as we were getting close  to the first anniversary my idea was to dedicate  this video to my Mom."
But the video was no good.
It did not convey any message.
"It had been done in a hurry -- it felt like a mere mix  of random scenes from that day, and -- did nothing to communicate what  the event was really all about."
"It wasn't that the person who did it  lacked the talent,"
-- he had plenty --  The thing was that he didn't put enough effort  in the making.
It hadn't been done the way
"I like things to be done,  wholeheartedly."
"And so, I could not dedicate  the video to my Mom."
"And what really caught  my attention from all this, was that the editor  took offense for my remarks."
Which got me thinking:
"What is to get offended if not a way to hide from  our own vulnerabilities, to avoid what we  don't want to hear?"
And do so to avoid what  we do not want to hear and to find excuses not to do  things the way we should.
So that's why I'm here  today talking to you:
Because I could not dedicate  that video to her.
And I decided to dedicate  this talk to her.
But it' turns out that this talk  was close to never happen.
"Three weeks ago, an oil spill in General Paz Avenue, almost got me to meet  my Mom right away -- (Laughter)"
"But thanks to a guardrail  that decided not to give in and spared me a twenty meter fall y a que por una enorme casualidad en la General Paz and the unlikely miracle  of finding no other car in 100 meter radius [330 feet], at the time of the crash, is that I'm now standing  here with you."
This talk that might have been about a great idea of a project I intended  to develop in Rosario became what it is right now.
Because I realized that I could've left  this world with a lot of unsaid stuff.
"For instance,  I wanted to tell that this year I was visited  by three women."
"Firstly, to remind me  that everything I do has to be done wholeheartedly."
"Secondly, to show me  the importance of being vulnerable  in front of other people, and the intimate relation  between vulnerability and doing things wholeheartedly."
"The third person, who apart  from all of you now, was the only one on Earth  who had heard me speak about my feelings, taught me that in order to do things right  I must learn to trust."
Trust in my own sensitivity.
"Trust others, who are dealing  with issues and fears of their own."

"As you can see at the bottom, there is the chip."
I'm sorry.
"The middle is the chip, the bottom is in the package."
"It's usually the size of a quarter, which is not too big, sometimes smaller even."
And this does all the work in your computer.
Some key terms that you don't need to know are feature size.
Feature size is the distance between two consecutive wires in the CPU.
"In this case, this computer has feature size of 45 nanometers."
That's so small that it's way too close.
"And nowadays, I believe they have a 22 and maybe sixteen coming up soon."
"Who? other things you need to know about this, that the CPUs have hundreds of thousands if not millions of transistors on them so that they could do all the computation really fast."
"And they have a multiple layers, so just"
looking at the top doesn't make much difference.
That's basically it.
One of the biggest topics when you learn
"Computer Science and when you do research in work in the development is Moore's Law, and, if you take anything away from this lecture, it should be Moore's Law."
"And Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on your chip is doubled about every two years, actually every eighteen months."
"What's Moore did, sorry, Moore is the [INAUDlBLE]."
"What Moore did was that he plotted the computers before his time for like two years and he said, you know, this has been happening so far and I'm going to predict that it's going to happen in the future and so far it has."
"As you can see in the slide, you can see a really nice straight line in a linear-log curve."
"It's a line in a linear-log curve, as you, go along it multiplies by two as every increment."
"Again, Moore's Law is super important that the transistors of a chip are multiplied by two and then they're twice as small every eighteen months."
Awesome.
A very common mistake about Moore's Law is thinking that a lot of exponential growth in computers are also relevant to Moore's Law and that's not true.
"So, here are, are a few."
"Moore's Law only talks about transistors, the top graph, And you can see that over the years, say, you can see more data points that it's held true."
Other things that have also held true is the power consumption How much power you take?
And that has basically doubled over time.
"So has the frequency, how fast your computer runs, the clocksped."
"What happens to this computers, go, have steps and every time the clock changes, they take another step."
"And as you raise the clockspeed, you make the computer faster and that has gone up."
"And the single thread performance, the speed of the computer doing one thing has also increases exponentially."
"And when we solved this equation, we would know exactly where the two bodies would be at all times."
"As long as we know where the bodies were when they started out, using that force law and this equation of motion, we could tell you what r would be for all future times."
That's called deterministic.
That's classical mechanics.
"Well, we're not going to do it, but we could actually set up a differential equation and solve for what r(t) is using that force law."
We could do that.
"And if I did that and if I started out the electron and the nucleus at one angstrom from each other, like they are, roughly speaking, in an atom, what would happen is that that electron would plummet into the nucleus in 10^-10 seconds."
"If I solved these equations,"
I would find that r would be equal to zero and t equal to 10^-10 seconds.
We've got a problem here.
"The problem is that this classical physics,"
"Newton's second law and the force law, it is predicting that after 10^-10 seconds the electron and the nucleus are on top of each other, they've neutralized each other."
We no longer have an atom that has a diameter of 10^-10 meters.
That's contrary to our observations.
This is saying the atom collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
But what we see is that the atom seemingly lives forever.
"So we've got a big problem here, as they did in 1911, 1912."
And the problem is that this kind of classical way of thinking does not predict our observations.
"It does not predict the fact that the atom lives together, it lives forever."
It says the atom falls apart.
"So it could be that the Coulomb force law is wrong, or it could be that this equation of motion is incorrect."
And of course what's going to turn out is that this equation of motion does not work for electrons in atoms.
You cannot use classical mechanics to describe the electron within the atom.
"We need a new kind of mechanics, and that new kind of mechanics is going to be quantum mechanics."
That is where we will pick up on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.
"When I was growing up in Montana,"
I had two dreams.
"I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur."
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
"""This isn't a party and we're not here for fun."
"We have a problem and we have to solve it like this and this and this"", with a very coded language, a very traditional political narrative, very endogamic..."
"And suddenly the square and the internet is full of messages that deactivate any assault that they can set on you from the outside, and they deactivate the social depression we're in."
Suddenly the people were happy.
There were marvellous phrases.
"I can't remember any right now have a terrible memory, but they're in the archives."
There are people doing a great job archiving material and in 30 years we can look over the jokes and irony of 2011.
For me Twitter is irony.
Except when you have thousands of followers and you can't say anything because everything can be misunderstood and they make a #whatshisnamefacts hashtag and they crush you.
"But when you're in a manageable state, Twitter is pure irony."
And irony works better than any other register.
And soon I saw tweets on banners.
After I'd seen the May '68 book maybe it's the other way around.
But I've laughed so much
All along the walls starting from the underground access gate all full of the most creative messages.
They were also very rich.
And very enrichening.
"Like, even though this goes nowhere, although it comes to nothing, or it doesn't fulfill people's expectations, at least it will have given those who were there a chance to detoxify themselves from the typical political discourse."
"Because it's so boring, political language is so grey and suddenly irony pops up in political language without being demogogical, it's great."
ST:
Even when we have to laugh at ourselves.
There were moments in which I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
"Whether to go or stay... and thanks to the tweets and three posters, I chuckled and was able to go on."
It's curious.
I was marvelled.
"And after a phenomena like this, the satire."
"Like @acampadapolicia, or @putohelicoptero, which is minimalist, but every time I got one of his messages I laughed so much..."
JL: tacatacatacatacatacatacataca...
[laughter]
"There was also a really funny thing that happened whenever I saw a helicopter anywhere in Spain I took a photo and said ""Look! @putohelicoptero is here!"""
Creativity has no limits. @acampadapolicia has made us laugh.
"And that opens so many doors to so many things, so much creativity, you just can't say it's a bad thing."
That's why we try to reduce our footprint.
Maybe you know this joke;
"One planet meets another planet, and says, ""You really look terrible today""."
"And the other planet says, ""Yes, I have Homo sapiens""."
"The first planet answers,"
"""Don't worry, I had this before;  it will disappear somehow""."
"We feel so bad, we think it's better we are not here."
"With all these environmental disasters, we lost a whole generation of good scientists."
"We have lots of smart MBA's, we have brilliant lawyers, but we don't have enough engineers."
"We don't have enough good scientists because how can you study chemistry, when you see Bhopal?"
"How can you study physics, when you see Chernobyl?"
And the one who studies to be a scientist did with a bad conscience..
"So that's why they try to be ""less bad""."
He apologizes everyday for being here.
That's the reasons that we're trying to minimize our footprint.
"We walk, and when we are in Sweden, for example, your footprint means destruction, that's why people try to minimize their footprint."
"But, when you are here, your footprint means the water stays longer."
"So why do we want to minimize our footprint, when we can have a beneficial footprint?"
So we can make things completely differently.
But this is what we do.
"Here, it stinks, this is PVC."
Never designed to go in biological systems.
"This is our catalog, it stinks; never designed for toilet paper."
It's hazardous waste.
"We need to reinvent our products, and the products need to look different, completely different."
"Everything that gets consumed; food, detergents, backpacks, need to be designed to grow up into biological systems."
Everything that is just used as a service needs to go back to the technical system.
"You cannot consume a window, you don't consume a washing machine, you don't consume a TV set, you only use it."
"So, we need to distinguish between two different cycles."
"Things which get consumed, like shoe soles, need to be designed to go to biological systems."
"Things which are just used, like the washing machine, need to be designed for the technical cycle, but right now,  they are just hazardous waste."
"So, we need to reinvent our products, completely from the beginning."
"April and May were bursting with flowers,"
"July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves."
"It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical."
"If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day,"
I would have thought you were crazy.
"But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet."
"And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed."
But why?
A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit.
It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago.
His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements.
"While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is."
"In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle."
"However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year."
Ah-ha!
"So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun!"
"Well, no, not so fast."
The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.
January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north.
Still not convinced?
How about this:
Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet.
"When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand."
"So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be?"
"Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up."
It actually tilts.
And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons.
The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.
"At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space."
"Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter."
"So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up."
"After the sun sets, it has time to cool down."
"Still, I think it's important to go to the hospital and get the diagnosis, for a record."
"Ah, for a record."
Right.
"Even if you think the diagnosis is off the mark, the fact that it's off the mark may later serve as an evidence of some kind."
The diagnosis can prove that a symptom similar to it did happen to you.
So I think you should go to the hospital.
I see.
But I hear many mothers have had bad experiences with doctors.
That's true.
"I know doctors have said various things to mothers, such as ""overreacting,"" ""too nervous,"" or ""that may be pollen allergy."""
But this is something Japanese doctors should learn as well from now on.
"We, too, often had bad experiences with doctors in Chernobyl."
"When they hear the words ""radiation exposure,"" they only think of cancers or leukemia."
"However, the health problems of children living in the contaminated areas are relatively minor and cannot be diagnosed."
"They have a whole range of such symptoms, which is called ""a bouquet of symptoms."""
The Japanese doctors who went to Chernobyl as part of the relief effort didn't examine such children.
They only treated children with more serious diseases.
"But you know, the children who got cancer is just the tip of an iceberg."
"Under the tip, there are innumerable children who have such minor symptoms as, say, fatigue."
Fatigue is a typical symptom of thyroid disorder.
Or eye swelling.
I frequently heard from mothers their children suffered from eye swelling after they fell in the contaminated places.
I hear there's a similar case recently.
Yes.
I often hear the story of how children fell in a sandpit with high radiation and their eyes get swollen the next day.
Sometimes swollen in purple.
"Also, quite a few people claim that bruises have appeared, or that moles have appeared or disappeared, which seem to have nothing to do with stress or physical conditions."
Some women claim the menstrual period has stopped or the menstrual cycle is irregular.
Others are saying their allergy has gotten worse.
Or their diseases have recurred.
These are the symptoms I noticed when looking at the emails.
"Another problem right now is people are eating contaminated food, because the Japanese radiation safety limit for food was raised."
Generally speaking there's not a real problem for health if we have much lower meat consumption.
And there are potential benefits.
I mean after all colon cancer is one of the commonest cancers in high income countries.
And the risk of colon cancer is higher with high meat consumption.
"So there would be a real benefit in terms of colon cancer risk, for example."
Going from our level of consumption to something that's just a bit below half of that would not involve any significant health harms and would almost certainly bring health benefits.
"As you have probably already guessed, I'm a vegetarian."
I actually used to like eating meat quite a lot.
"But that was until around twelve years ago when I saw a Dutch TV documentary called ""What the cow wants""."
It contained some really bizarre footage.
This hole was made a few years ago.
Cows can live very long with this.
Sometimes more than ten years.
This is a hole with a diameter of around 4 inches.
Inside there is a silicone ring.
With inside a lid.
"When I push, it should be possible to open it."
Now it's open.
The lid comes out.
Here we have a part of the grass the animal just ate.
"When I saw this, for me that was the very limit."
"Animal diseases, animal suffering, animals that were no longer treated as living beings."
I had seen it all and I thought:
"""No, not in my name!"
"I want no part in this any more."""
And that's how you put the lid back on.
"In the factory farming industry, animals are adapted to the food that we choose to give them and the massive stalls in which they are forced to live."
"They are mutilated, they are given antibiotics to stop them getting sick."
Pigs are now sometimes even given anti-stress pills to help them cope with their unnatural living conditions.
"Yet the fact that it turns out that livestock makes an enormous contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by belching, farting and defecating doesn't necessarily mean that we'll start keeping fewer cows, pigs and chickens?"
"No, the industry will simply dream up something new."
"Would you believe it, they now even make fist-sized pills to stop cows from farting so much?"
"So given that this is theta and this is 90 - theta, what is our angle going to be?"
"Well they all, collectively, add up to 180 degrees."
So you have theta + (90-theta) + our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees.
"The thetas cancel out (theta - theta), and you have 90 + our mystery angle is a 180 degrees,"
We subtract 90 from both sides.) - and you are left with your mystery angle equalling 90 degrees.
So that all worked out well.
So let me make that clear.
That's going to be useful for us.
So now we can say definitively that this is 90 degrees.
This is a right angle.
"Now what we are going to do, is we are going to construct a trapezoid."
"This side 'a' is parallel to side 'b' down here the way its been constructed and this is just one side right over here, this goes straight up and now let's just connect these two sides right over there."
So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid.
"One is we can just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area,"
And then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components.
So let's just first think of it as trapezoid.
"So, what do we know about the area of the trapezoid?"
"The area of a trapezoid,is gonna be the height of the trapezoid, which is (a+b) times, the way I think of it, the mean or average of the top and the bottom."
"So, ar(trapezoid) = (a+b) x 1/2(a+b)"
"In the intuition there you are taking the height times the average of the bottom and the top, gives you the area of the trapezoid."
"Now, how can we also figure out the area with its component parts?"
"So as far as we do the correct things, we should come up with the same result. so how else can we come up with this area?"
"Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles."
The area of each of them is one half of a times b.
"But there's two of them, Let me do that say in blue colour,"
"But there's two of these right triangles, so let's multiply them by two."
"So 2 times half ab, that takes into consideration this bottom right triangle, and this top one. and what's the area of this large one, that I'll colour in green"
"Well that's pretty straightforward, it's just one half c times c."
"So, plus one half c times c, which is one half c square."
"Now , let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with and you might guess where all of this is going."
"So, we can rearrange this."
"So this one half times (a+b) squared is going to be equal to two times one half, well that's just going to be one, so its gonna be equal to a times b plus one half c squared."
The new basis is orthonormal.
"Therefore, β0 is equal to v0 inner product with x. β1 is inner product of v1 with x."
"In compact form, we can write β0, β1 as a matrix vector multiplication with a matrix R, which is a rotation matrix."
"A key fact of the rotation matrix, that you can easily verify, is that R transpose times R is equal to identity."
Let's compute a square norm in the canonical basis.
"So, the square norm of x is equal to α0 squared α1 squared."
"In the rotated basis, it's equal to β0 squared plus β1 squared."
Let's verify Parseval.
"So, β0 square plus β1 square is equal to the vector β transposed times β."
This is equal to Rα transpose times Rα.
We reorder the terms.
"We find R transpose R in the middle, but this is equal to identity, so, we have α transpose time α, which, indeed, is equal to α0 squared + α1 squared, verifying Parseval's formula."
Let us now look at approximation.
The problem is the following.
"We have a vector x that belongs to a space v, and we have a subspace S, that is included in v."
"We would like to approximate x with xhat, which belongs to S."
"Of course, there are various ways to do this approximation."
"We are going to be interested in approximation that minimizes the quadratic error, meaning, the difference between x and xhat should be minimum in quadratic norm."
"If we have an orthonormal basis for S, so Sk, k going from 0 to K-1 is an orthornormal basis for S."
"Then, the orthonormal projection will simply be x hat is equal to the summation of the inner product between x and Sk times Sk."
"This orthogonal projection is the best approximation over S, in the sense of least squares."
"So, the least square approximation has properties that it will give a minimum, quadratic error norm."
"So, among all y's that belong to S, the ones that minimizes the quadratic error is x hat, and the error is orthogonal to the approximation."
"So, x minus x hat, inner product with x hat, is equal to 0."
We're going to see this graphically now.
"So, we are in R2, x is a vector in R2, the subspace s is a one dimensional subspace."
And we start exploring what would be the closest point to x belonging to s.
"So, we put circles, we let them grow."
"And as they grow, at some point they touch s, that will be our point x hat, that's given by the blue vector."
And the difference x minus x hat indeed is orthogonal to x hat.
"To make this more concrete, let us look at an example, namely, polynomial approximation."
"So, we look at the Hilbert space, PN, from -1 to 1."

Please wind stop blowing.
Now it's all in the past.
What should I do if I miss you.
I'm just crying like a fool.
Please wind stop blowing.
All right so QuickFind is too slow for huge problems.
"So, how are we going to do better?"
"Our first attempt is an alternative called, Quick-union."
This is so called lazy approach to algorithm design where we try to avoid doing work until we have to.
It uses the same data structure or array ID with size M but now it has a different interpretation.
We are going to think of that array as representing a set of trees that's called a forest as depicted at right.
"So, each entry in the array is going to contain a reference to its parent in the tree."
"So, for example, 3's parent is four, 4's parent is nine."
So 3's entry is four and 4's entry is nine in the array.
Now each entry in the array has associated with it a root.
That's the root of its tree.
"Elements that are all by themselves in just, in their own connected component, point to themselves, so one points to itself but also nine points to itself."
"It's the root of the tree, containing two, four and three."
"So, from this data structure we can associate with each item a root, which is representative, say, of it's connected component."
"So that's the root of three is nine, going up that root."
"Now, once we can calculate these roots, then we can implement the find operation just by checking whether the two items that we're supposed to check with are connective where they have the same root."
"That's equivalent to saying, are they in the same connective component?"
"So that's some work, going to find the roots of each item but the union operation is very easy."
To merge components containing two different items.
Two items that are in different components.
All we do is set the ID of P's route to the ID of Q's route.
"Let's make P's tree point to Q. So in this case, we would change the entry of nine to be six to merge three and five."
The components containing three and five.
And with just changing one value in the array we get the two large components emerged together.
That's the Quick-union algorithm.
Because a union operation only involves changing one entry in the array.
"Fincher would always say, ""It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."""
"And thing our process and the technology couldn't do, is they couldn't understand intent, the intent of the actor."
So it sees a smile as a smile.
"It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile."
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
"But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology ""emotion capture,"" as opposed to just motion capture."
Take another look.
Brad Pitt:
"Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon, but ... maybe not."
EU:
That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.
(Applause)
"A couple of quick factoids; it really took 155 people over two years, and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut."
"But, that is Benjamin."
Thank you.

A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
"Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore."
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
"This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy."
"You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything."
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
"Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town."
"Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on."
What does it look like if that's not the case?
And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
"As a friend of mine says, ""Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."""
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
"From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world."
We're getting a lot of interest from government.
You are not alone.
I will be with you.
"Then, Jesus's commandment is:"
"""Go and make disciples."""
"So, Jesus has disciples."
Jesus wants christians.
"And so, the confusion in this verse,"
"I can't talk about the whole book, but at least in this verse, the confusion is there."
"""I do not wish to make you christians."""
Because Jesus WANTS people to become christians.
"A christian, a disciple, a disciple of Jesus."
"""Polak's Question:"
"Round 3"""
Earlier at the UN COmmission on Narcotic Drugs
"In 2008 Vlenna, Frederick Polak, a Dutch psychiatrist asked Antonio Maria Costa, HEAD of UNODC a simple question:"
"How does Costa explain the fact that the cannabis consumption levels are not higher in the Netherlands than in the neighboring countries, although in the Netherlands cannabis is available for consumption by adults?"
"Costa silenced his ""NGO Partner."""
"Embarrassed by our video, he decided to make his first official visit . . ."
"Mr. Polak asked Mr. Costa again at the International Harm Reduction Conference in Barcelona on May 15, 2008."
Good morning.
"Fredrick Polak, psychiatrist from Amsterdam, well, this is a continuation on the question I already posed, which I will very shortly repeat, the relationship between the availability of cannabis in the Netherlands, and the relatively low or average level of use, which in my view is contrary to the theory of prohibition."
"But now I would like to ask Mr. Costa, we heard that you made a visit to Holland and you visited a coffee shop and a consumer room, and I would like to ask you, what did you learn in Holland, and what are your impressions?"
Regarding Mr. Polak's sort of a continuing of questioning on the relationship between availability in Holland and high Availability of what? level of use.
"Availability of drugs, and the level, availability of alcohol and the level, availability of tobacco and the level."
I'm surprised Mr. Polak there is no focus as well on tobacco and alcohol.
"Here is the thing, for a number of reasons"
I am getting close to the Netherlands emotionally and culturally and many other reasons a country that I respect
"I decided in order to address the errors as scientifically as we could possibly do,"
"I decided to travel in a study mission to Amsterdam, the core if you wish of initiatives which are obviously quite problematic,"
"like the coffee shops, or for that matter the sex windows, where women are exposed in big windows at street level."
I decided to go there.
"It was a very interesting session, a couple of weeks ago,"
For a few days at least.
"Because they're pacifists and suddenly they get hit, and they're insulted and they're treated so degradingly and so unnecessarily."
"That makes us really skeptical of the system represented by these policemen, those agents who maltreated them so incredibly."
"So I think it's not very intelligent to let the police, even though it's just a few individuals, to let them do those things."
It's not very intelligent at all.
You're turning people against you.
"Against you as a system, as a state, as whatever."
"I think it's unnecessary, absolutely unnecessary."
"And that night was very unpleasant, and it was unpleasant not to be there to see it and talk about it."
"That day I was on holiday and I didn't go to Madrid, like other times, to the demonstration."
And it was unpleasant not to be there and not to be able to inform about it.
ST:
Let's change topic to something radically different which has helped me to process my emotions.
In my experience of the 15M there's one thing that's really important: humour.
"Whether it's humour in the shape of stories like @putohelicoptero, @acampadapolicia, the posters or even my own tweets."
From time to time I had a kind of humour registry that helped me.
"I'd like you to tell me what you thought about the use of humour within the 15M, and how important it has been."
JL:
The other day I went to a bookshop and I saw on one of the shelves a book of banners from May '68.
I was confused so I took the book and I was surprised to find tweets.
"They were what I would have regarded as great sarcastic phrases for Twitter and banners, very much in line with the 15M."
But suddenly they were there.
"Obviously the cultural and terminological references are different, but there was so much creativity."
"That's for starters, because I remember seeing it the other day."
"And I've laughed so much, from the very beginning in the Puerta del Sol because there were such good phrases."
"Some were devastating, and others were very funny."
"You ended up laughing, copying them down and tweeting them, and sharing them because they're so creative, and the 15M has always considered creativity and humour way above aggresiveness and affiliation."
The richness of so many different messages.
"Some people think they're naive, and that just making jokes is a far cry from organising a revolution."
There are people who think so and say so.
People who think that in the Puerta del Sol there is no party.
"I've heard it in assemblies: ""we're not here to celebrate anything"""
"And as your velocity changes, the distance and time also change."
That's the equivalent of rotating the coordinate system.
"But there is something that doesn't change, and let me write that down."
This is usually given the Greek
letter Tau [T] squared.
And this is equal to (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)) + (Δ Z^(2)) - c^(2) (ΔT)^(2).
And this is invariant.
"This is an invariant interval, sometimes called proper distance."
"And as you change your velocity--as the space, as the mass, as the time all change--this quantity, describing the separation of two events--so, this describes the separation of two events, that quantity changes--doesn't change."
That quantity is invariant.
"Okay, so now, this answers one of the questions that was asked before."
Why does one use c^(2) or c to transform the space coordinate into the time coordinate and back?
It's because you need the c^(2) out here in order to make this invariant.
"If you're calculating the distance, if you use x^(2) plus 1/2 y^(2) or some other constant times y^(2), you're not going to get something that's invariant."
"And it's only when you use the c, here, that you end up with something that's invariant."
"And so, if you think about these as representing the four coordinates of the system, it's clear this one coordinate is x, one is y, one is z, just as you would expect."
"And then, there's this other coordinate, which is c times T, but it's negative so it has to be times the square root of -1."
"So, the four coordinates in space-time can be thought of as x, y, Z and i cT, if you want to think of it that way."
"And the time coordinate is imaginary, because when you square it, you have to end up with a negative number."
Don't worry about the details of that.
"But the presence of the c^(2) here is why you have to use c, in particular, to get from time to space and back."
And that's necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with velocity.
All right.
"So, this is actually kind of a weird expression."
"Because unlike the distance between two points--and you'll notice, these three terms put together, that's just the distance squared, ordinarily, but that is not invariant anymore, because there's this other term here, which can vary."
"Unlike the distance, this doesn't have to be positive."
You've got three different cases here.
This interval can be zero for different points.
"In ordinary distance it can only be zero if the two points are the same, but this can be zero for different points, for different events."
"It can be zero, it can be negative, and it can be positive."
"So, what does that mean?"
What happens when it's zero?
"If they're not equal, then you have too much of one and not enough of the other."
"So basically, what we can do is we can solve in this example-- in this example, we could say the marginal product of labor is 1/2 k over the square root of k times l."
The marginal product of capital from this production function is-- once again I'm using this production function q equals square root of k times l.
Marginal project of capital is 1/2 I over square root of k times l.
So the ratio of the marginal products is simply k over l.
"The marginal rate of technical substitution, given this production function, is k over l."
That's the marginal rate of technical substitution.
"So this says that given this production function and these prices, at the optimum you should set k over I equal to w over r, which equals 1/2."
"So what this says is given this production function, these price ratios, the optimal thing to do is to use half as much capital as labor."
"Half as much capital as labor is the optimal thing to do, and that's what we see in figure 9-2, is the optimal thing to do is use half as much capital as labor."
"Now, in other words, let's say, to now develop the intuition."
"Imagine you told me no, I should use as much capital as"
I should use labor.
As much capital as I should use labor.
Imagine I told you that.
"Imagine I said no, in fact, the efficient thing to use is why not have one machine for every worker?"
How would you tell me intuitively why that's wrong?
Why would I be wrong to say use one machine for every worker?
"Why would that be wrong, given the prices prevailing in the market?"
Someone can tell me this.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"Well, renting machines is a lot more expensive than paying more workers."
JON GRUBER:
Twice as expensive to rent a machine as get a worker.
AUDlENCE:
So it would be more cost-effective to have the workers share machines rather than get a whole new machine.
JON GRUBER:
"The key point is the machine costs twice as much, but the machine doesn't do twice as much."
The machine and the worker do the same thing.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is one.
"You're indifferent between one more machine and one more worker, but the machine cost twice as much as the worker."
"Well, it turns out that a lot of us forgot somewhere along the line that are actually all of knowledge is connected."
"When you hear someone remarkable, whoever they are, share something of their passion or what they do, not only you're inspired by them personally, but you start to see connections that you didn't see before between what you do and what they do, or someone else does."
"So, we spend our lives digging these trenches."
"That's we get really good at one thing, and that's where we live, that's where we're focused."
"TED is the moment when you come out of your trench, and you ascend up a slope, and you see how what you do connects with whatever else does."
It can be really eye-opening and thrilling.
It can fill you with a new sense of possibility.
"So in, let's see, 11 years ago, I was certainly digging my own trench."
"I was trying to build this technology publishing company, magazines, websites."
I was in it deep.
"This was the year, I first went to TED."
I was smitten.
"You know, I'd always thought of myself  as this slightly ""Odd Man Out."""
"Like I always struggled to make conversations about house and God and family gossip, movies, celebrity, and all the things I think normal people talk about, do they?"
(Laughter) (Audience) We don't know.
CA :
(Laughing) 'We don't know'.
That was a great comment!
"At TED, I found myself surrounded by this motley crew of geeks, sort of passionate entrepreneurs, inventors, creators."
"Really, they didn't have a whole lot in common except that they were all very curious, they were all absolutely eager or willing to talk out-of-the-box ideas and to engage in conversations that depending on your view point, rather a little bit crazy or might turn out to be really important."
"I loved it, I thought I'd come home."
"And, the media entrepreneur in me noticed something as well."
"So, media were obsessed with this."
Attention is a currency.
"We measure it in lots of different ways: we measure eye balls, how many are there, ratings, circulation, and so forth."
"We also look at demographics, who owns those eye balls."
Bill Gates is worth more than Billy Blogs.
"And, there is a third measure of attention that is much harder to measure."
"So, we don't often talk about it."
We should because it is the most important of the three.
It's the measure of thequality of attention.
Is it focused or casual?
Let's do one more.
I think that's all I have time for.
Let's do minus one ninth minus one over four.
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six.
So that's equal to thirty-six.
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?
"Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six."
We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.
"So we have negative one, so it becomes negative four."
Then minus one over thirty-six.
"Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine, or we have to multiply the denominator by nine, so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine."
One times nine is nine.
"So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six, which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six."
I think that's all I have time for right now.
And I'll probably add a couple more modules.
But I think that right now that you might be ready to do the adding and subtracting module.
Have fun.
Now we are ready to begin talking about actual program optimizations and we begin with local optimizations.
"Local optimization is the simplest form of program optimization because it focuses on optimizing just a single basic block, so just one basic block and, in particular, there is no need worry about complicated control flow, we are not going to be looking at the entire method or procedure body."
Let's dive right in and take a look at a couple of simple local optimizations.
"If x is an integer valued variable And from here on, we'll assume that x has type-ins."
So let me just write that down.
We're going to assume that x has type-ins in all of our examples on this slide.
"Then the statement x=x+0, well that doesn't change the value of x."
Zero is the additive identity for +.
We're just going to assign x the value it currently has.
And so this statement is actually useless.
It can just be deleted from the program.
"Similarly, for x=x*1."
"Multiplying by one will not change the value of X, and so that statement can also be removed."
And in this case these are great optimizations because we actually save an entire instruction.
"Now, some statements can't be deleted, but they can be simplified."

"In 1919, ""My Antonia"" had been out for a year."
And Cather was getting a lot of attention.
People loved this book.
She wrote her mother in December of 1919 and you can just feel on the page how excited she is to share with her parents how famous she's beginning to become.
MUSlC
CATHER'S VOlCE:
"In addition to painting the bathroom and doing the house work and trying to write a novel,"
"I have been becoming rather famous lately, and that is an added care."
"In other years, when I was living like a lady, with an impressive French maid, I could have been famous quite conveniently, but then I had only to receive a few high brows."
Now the man in the street seems to have got onto me and it's very inconvenient.
Reporters come running to the house all the time and keep finding me doing housework.
They demand new photographs and I have no new clothes and no time to get any.
"Yesterday, when I was washing dishes at the sink with one of Mother's long gingham aprons tied around my neck, I've never had time to shorten it,"
I heard a knock at the front door and didn't stir.
Then a knock at the kitchen door; such a dapper young man asked if Miss Cather the Author lived here that I hesitated.
"He said, ""Tell her I'm from the New York Sun and want to see her on very important business."""
I told him that miss Cather had gone to Atlantic city for a rest.
I simply couldn't live up to the part you see.
He left saying there was to be a big article about her on Sunday.
That was just the beginning for Cather.
She's still popular to this day.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he's ordered new restrictions on airstrikes targeting Taliban militants hiding in residential homes.
The directive from General John Allen prompted the Afghan government to claim the U.S.-led NATO occupation force has agreed to stop bombing residential areas and homes altogether.
"But U.S. officials say the attacks will continue but now under stricter guidelines for airstrikes, not ground operations."
"The new policy was unveiled amidst widespread anger over the latest NATO attack that killed 18 civilians, including nine children, last week."
"On Friday, Allen emt directly with some of the victims"" families and apologized to the Afghan people."
"This was a joint Afghan and U.S. force, they were taken under fire, a hand grenade was thrown, three of our people were wounded."
We called for the people who were shooting to come out and then the situation became more grave and innocent people were killed.
"On those occasions when our forces accidently kill or harm Afghan people, we are very sad."
These kids are being medicated as routinely as we had our tonsils taken out.
"And on the same whimsical basis, and for the same reason - medical fashion."
Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth.
"They're being besieged with information, and force their attention from every platform, computers, from iPhones, from advertising holdings, from hundreds of television channels."
And we're penalizing them now for getting distracted.
"From what, boring stuff, at school for the most part."
"It seems to me it's not a coincidence, totally, that the instance of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing."
"Now, these kids are being given Ritalin and Adderall, and all manner of things, often quite dangerous drugs, to get them focused and calm them down."
"But according to this,"
Attention Deficit Disorder increases as you travel east across the country.
People start losing interest in Oklahoma
[laughter].
They can hardly think straight in Arkansas
[laughter].
"And by the time they get to Washington, they have lost it completely."
"And there are separate reasons for that, I believe"
[laughter].
It's a fictitious epidemic.
"If you think of it, the arts, and I don't say this exclusively of the arts."
I think it's also true of science and of maths.
"But let me, I say about the arts particularly because they are the victims of this mentality currently, particularly."
The arts especially address the idea of aesthetic experience.
And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak.
When you are present in the current moment.
When you're resonating with the excitement of this thing that you're experiencing.
When you are fully alive.
And anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what's happening.
And a lot of these drugs are that.
We're getting our children through education by anesthetizing them.
And I think we should be doing the exact opposite.
"We shouldn't be putting them asleep, we should be waking them up to what they have inside of themselves."
"But the model we have is this, it's, I believe, we have a system of education that is modeled on the interests of industrialism, and in the image of it."
Congratulations.
You've finally gotten through the discussion about the different parameters and the desired Googlebot behavior.
And now you can go back to your site and repeat this process for the different parameters that you have.
You don't have to do this for every single parameter.
"But just including a few, and specifying the right Googlebot behavior can really help with your crawl efficiency."
We're almost done.
But you might be asking one last question.
"Which is, ""What about multiple parameters in one URL?"" For example, ""sku equals 234 page equals three and sort by equals price"" etcetera."
How does URL parameters work when there are multiple parameter settings?
The answer is to remember that URL parameters is about crawling your site more efficiently.
So you can imagine that all URLs that we know about for your site.
"So if you're the Google store, all 380,000 URLS begin as eligible for crawling."
And then we work as a process of elimination.
Not inclusion.
So we take our knowledge of your site.
Combined by each of your settings in URL parameters to slowly weed away the URLs that shouldn't be crawled.
"Until at the very end, we have a smaller subset of good URLs."
To recap.
"If you're now more comfortable with the URL Parameters, please utilize this feature for more efficient crawling of your site."
You can start with specifying the parameters that do not change page content.
Those should be easier to do.
"And then after you have done that step, the next step is to specify parameters that change the page content."
"And remember, if you can't determine, don't guess."
"Please ""let Googlebot decide."""
"One more time, the sorts parameter."
"If the sorts parameter for your site never exists in a URL by default, then ""Crawl No URLs."""
"Or if site-wide, the same sort value is always used, then ""Crawl URLs with value x."" For ""Narrows"" if your ""narrows"" parameter causes non-useful filtering for searchers, like size or price, then you might select ""Crawl No"
"URLs."" Just be sure to double-check that none of your important pages will be affected."
"For ""specifies"" it's usually ""Crawl Every URL."" And the same applies to ""Translates"" and ""Paginates."""
Yay!
I think we've covered a lot of information about URL parameters.
Here are links to more resources if you want further help.
"There's some science behind it, but it's within a range of what we have historically done."
"We have looked at other properties that have a lot of page views, and much of the social networking things, for example."
And they don't monetize that well.
And they don't monetize nearly as well as text search.
"So we're unlikely to do major changes there, although we're trying a few things."
"The next--another way of asking your question is, where is the next source of revenue?"
"And the next source of revenue is the current business functioning better with better conversion, more traffic, more advertisers, which is our core business."
"The next, and adjacent, business, is a set of display businesses and an exchange that are being built as a consequence of the Double Click acquisition."
The display business is as large as the text search business.
It's relatively balkanized??
(30:39).
It's not a uniform in any particular way.
"The systems are complicated, the way the display ads are managed, is done, in many cases, by hand or by poor quality spreadsheets."
"So we see an opportunity to apply the Google magic, you know, the measurement and the scaling, in that business."
And that's probably the next big one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Any other questions?
"Yep, right here."
We'll move beyond the first three rows at some point. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thank you.
I wanted to get your thoughts on Twitter.
"There's been a lot of discussion there that potentially it evolves as a real time search engine, and in an un-Google-like way, you haven't really responded with any sort of application or product there, outside of, maybe, Blogger."
How do you foresee that product in the next few years?
And is that a potential or a threat for Google? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We're in favor of all of these new communications mechanisms.
Google just put up a Google Twitter site.
Google can tweet to you.
It's called At Google.
And so you can go ahead and listen to our ruminations as to where we are and what we're doing in 160 characters or
less.
"Speaking as a computer scientist, I view all of these as, sort of, poor man's email systems."
"In other words, they have aspects of an email system, but they don't have a full offering."
"So, to me the question about companies like Twitter is, do they fundamentally involve as sort of â€˜note' phenomena?"
What kind of.
What are some tips can you give people who are in that stage of the publication process?
"Well first of all although acceptance of the revision is not, is not guaranteed that we will see so in the letter."
Yeah.
"I think he should take that as, as encouraging."
Yeah.
In fact that had got has that first reviewing stage is really a good sign and you should work hard to.
Improve the paper so it will get accepted.
Yeah.
"And The First of all, either whatever the you know, first of all, list each comment that the reviewers make, and respond to that."
"It makes it much easier as an editor to, to, to be able to see that the author took into account every comment that e, that, that both reviewers, or as many reviewers were involved, made."
"And the editor will often make comments too, and list them, and respond to each one separately."
"And Either, whatever the comment says."
"Either fix it, fix what the problem is."
"Or explain why you, you don't think that, that criticism is, is valid or important."
Explain why you don't want to fix it.
"And make, you know, give a good argument for that."
Show And also please show the editor where you made the changes in the manuscript.
They'll.
"You know if someone says I just change th-, the method section to reflect this."
"That's sort of hard for us to find wh-, what exactly you did, so, either highlight the change, list the changes in, when you respond to the comments, either highlight them in the manuscript and say, you know, say where they occur, highlight them, or use track changes supply in addition to the, The version where you get rid of the track changes also provide the version that has track changes, so that the editor can see exactly what you did."
Yeah.
"Or sometimes, sometimes a paper will be sent out for further, review, further peer review."
"Sometimes the peer reviewers have really strong concerns, and I as an editor will say, will send it back to them and say did, did the author really satisfy your concerns about this?"
And be polite.
[laugh].
"Yeah, don't like he just said that."
"You know, that, that, oh, this, this reviewers stupid."
You know.
[laugh].
But he didn't really.
"We just say, oh, we thank the reviewers for their constructive criticisms."
(Applause)
"You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something."
"Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, ""I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"" they would say, ""Thank you very much, we have other things to do."""
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
"You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, ""I am this, I am that, I am that."""
No.
It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
"And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through."
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
"And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth."
"And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts."
For me it came very early.
"When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her."
"It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families."
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
"He came to talk to her and said, ""What is this about?"""
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
"Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in ""The Mahabharata"" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences."
"Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, ""Hey girl, that's it!"""
"And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,"
"""Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça?"
"Ça!"""
"And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, ""This is it!"""
"And I thought, ""This is what we need, as a language."""
We had somebody from public health.
And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
"Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year."
"And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation."
"So, what do they do?"
What about a?
"Well, this one is big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's also a, big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's a, a and all diseased."
"This one's a, a and almost all diseased."
"So clearly in this case, A, the genotype at the A marker, is more predictive of whether you have the disease, than, than the genotype at the B marker."
"So we can assume that A is probably closer to this, disease causing [inaudible]."
And we haven't said whether it's between A and B or not.
"It could be in that little area above A, as I said before."
All we can do if and this is assumption if this is a simple genetic trait that is fully explained by a single gene having a very large effect.
"What we can do is we can split this section up, this whole section over here and just infer what's going on at the disease causing mutation."
So we are saying these ones are healthy and this one is diseased.
"Or if you only get the disease when you have the mutation then this one must necessarily be little C and little C. And this one over here, must necessary be big C, little c, right?"
"Because these ones are carriers, they're healthy, these ones are diseased."
"So, let's break that up."
"Again, we have another gene causing disease, so we're just splitting this row up."
"So we're taking this original problem that we were looking at two markers and basically now looking at three, the third being what we're inferring to be happening at the disease-causing gene."
"I split this up relative to disease status, and that was it."
"So what we can do is we can split up all these other ones, like this one right here."
"These ones, necessarily are there aren't any."
These ones would be and we can continue the same process that I just did.
So I just broke up everything here.
From the previous slide into this set of individuals.
"And again, we're assuming all big C little C are healthy."
"They're carriers of the disease but they do not exhibit, actually exhibit the disease."
"And little C little C in this case are, are, are all healthy.'Kay?"
"So, without doing any math."
"Without doing any math at all, I want you to tell me the order of the genes here."
"Is the c of disease causing mutation between a and b, is it off past b, or is it off past a?"
It's very simple.
What you do in this case is you just try to figure out which one is the double recombinant.
And from that and since you know the phase you can figure out which one is in the middle.
You had to get back in touch.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Can we get back to the question?
MAN 1:
Yeah how do you see that type of thing growing up in a network connected society changing?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
It's a very good question.
"I think for a lot of people it's an entirely good thing to be able to stay in touch but there are certain people who, as you said, have always throughout history had a possibility to make a clean break and reinvent themselves."
And I head Jaron Lanier recently talk about Bob Dylan when he went from being
"Robert Zimmerman in the town in Minnesota, left, totally reinvented himself and became"
"Bob Dylan in New York City, great artist."
"You know what would happen today, if Facebook was around and there is Robert Zimmerman goofing off in Minnesota and everybody when he goes to Greenwhich Village and says your that guy, you're not Bob Dylan."
"And so for a certain segment of people, it does lock us into an identity, I think, much earlier than we're ever locked in before."
"And, for those people, which might be just, you know, the great majority of people might not mind being locked into an identity and might like having perpetual contact with their co-kindergarteners or whatever, but I think there is a segment of society which is going to find it much much tougher and these might be great artists as well, since they tend to go through this will find it much tougher to reinvent themselves."
PETER NORVlG:
"Okay as a reminder to our audience, this program has been provided by the"
Commonwealth Club's Inforum Division.
"Tonight we are hosting Nicholas Carr, author of the Shallows:"
What the Internet is Doing to our Brians.
"And I'm Peter Norvig, director of research."
Lets go to a question on this side.
MAN 2:
Okay I know from my personal experience that I tend to agree with you.
"My ability to read a book is diminishing every year, whereas I could read one a week, now I'm about one a year."
So I know that its happening.
One thing that I would be interested in is your feelings about the future affect of this.
I think you are underestimating the affect.
"I think that it is actually worse because we have an accelerating rate of change in society so the number of channels that we have to deal with, the number of modes of communications that we have to deal with continue to accelerate and change."
"So I'm wondering if it'll actually become a worse affect over the next 5 years, ten years and so forth?"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I'm already kind of pigeonholed as a commergent, so I'm a little nervous about answering that question truthfully, but I think that's right."
I mean I think that we're facing a continuation of this trend.
"Its not a physically invariant object, Lorentz transformations change it and indeed this distance means nothing physical and reading it off the graph produces no useful information."
"So, it is not true that I can measure off distances."
"They see and on the same scale as I did over there and thus, we figure out where the t prime equal to two save point is."
"So, how do I do it?"
"Well, if I really want to plot where along the t prime axis, the point say t prime equals to one is, what I need to do is the following construction: remember there is something that is preserved in this weird and is physically meaningful in this low ends relativistic world, and that is that c^2 t^2 - x^2 is the same as c^2 sorry for the color violation here, minus x prime squared."
"And along the t prime axis well, that's the point where x prime = zero."
So
I can erase that.
"Furthermore, along the t prime axis, x = vt because this describes the motion of the left side of the ladder which is moving with speed v. So I get that c^2 - v^2."
T squared is equal to equal to c squared t prime squared.
"I am going to eventually figure out exactly the time dilation, relativistic time dilation formula which is that t prime is t times square root of one minus v squared over c squared."
What does that mean?
"That means that the time here, t prime at this point is less than one."
If I draw the point t prime equal to one.
It will be somewhere over here.
And the point t'= two is somewhere over there.
Notice that the scales of the two axis are different.
This is confusing and troubling.
"It has to do with the fact that what is physically meaningful is this Lewenstein Distant, distance if you want this sort of weird distance with the minus sign rather than the Euclidean distance that were."
Is the distance that we observe in the graph.
And you can perform with negative value for the interval a similar calculation.
And you will find that the scale of the x-axes also is extended.
And in general in any space-time diagram the scale is smallest.
And the Observers.
For the observer that is addressed.
"In other words if I draw here the lines of constant x, the constant t prime and the lines of constant x prime then I find indeed that if I drew."
"X equals one, two, three and CT is one, two, three."
"And I then want to draw the lines of x prime equal one two, three."
Then I need to draw them approximately here.
And then x prime equals three would
"lie, lay, lie way over there."
"And likewise, t prime equals to one would be way up here, and two and three and so on."
"In some sense, being aware of context -- that things look one way from one perspective, you look at it from another perspective, it can be a whole different thing."
"What ""certainty"" is, by definition, is something that is, that's SUPPOSED to make us feel very comfortable and satisfied and certain about life."
"But you've said ""certainty"" is ""counter learning."""
Yeah.
"All this search for ""certainty,"" is in some sense, again, like shooting ourselves in the foot."
I think the strategies that we've been taught about how to learn
lead to the overwhelming feeling of incompetence that so many people have.
To boredom and depression.
And in that people are searching and some of the things that they come up with as a way of explaining this I think get them into more trouble.
"The application of mindfulness extends, as you've made the point, you know, throughout life."
Let's start with children.
"You're saying that we have to start doing in our schools, we have to start teaching them to be active deciders, not passive deciders."
What's involved with that?
"Well, again, it goes back to this notion of certainty."
Most people are afraid of uncertainty.
And
I think what we have to do is learn how to exploit the power of uncertainty.
"Um, let me give you an example."
I don't know if this will be meaningful to you.
"But when I was in school, I was taught The Battle of Hastings was 1066."
"Now, that's all I know about The Battle of Hastings."
This doesn't seem to me a very important piece of information.
"You almost get the sense that people were saying, ""OK, we'd better get ready because The Battle of Hastings is about to begin."""
"Rather than realizing that somebody decided that we're going to call this ""The Battle of Hastings."""
It doesn't begin that way.
"When does a conflict become, you know, a skirmish;"
A skirmish become a conflict; a conflict become a war.
When do we want to call it a war?
"All of these labels that we have, all of our categories are given by people and it hides all the ambiguity.\"
Attentiveness:
"Most teachers, they are doing a good job, and you and you would (I would) probably concur if I was looking into their little window, into their classroom, if all the students had their hands on the desks, sitting in a straight line with rapt attention."
"Yet you said ""creative distraction"" can be helpful in the classroom."
But the rest of them I just make on the fly because they usually don't have any data in them.
- Also Wonder Helper functions.
- Wonder Helper functions?
- Nice.
Just a couple of quick examples on how to write very simple formatters.
This one here just takes an NSArray and puts it with a bunch of page breaks between it.
"You can easily deal with a little WORepetition and a string, but then you've got another component with a WORepetition and String or you've got part of your component that is less reusable than it could be because it's inside of it."
"That ""return buffer.append"" in the format command is the entire implementation of the formatter, and it's not particularly difficult."
We're not going to bother parsing this so I just throw an exception.
"But, those are the only two methods you actually have to implement to make a formatter."
"If you're doing output only, it can be as simple as one line long."
A little bit more complex example.
This one here converts between separators in a string.
"I'm working on a system now as a bunch of legacy stuff, and some things are comma separated and some things are tab separated."
I use a formatter to move things back and forth.
"You can also do the same thing if you've got a string of text that somebody's typed in a text box and you want to format it out in HTML to keep the page breaks, it'll do that."
"If you've got a bunch of HTML like from an XML file or something and you want to convert it back into a paragraph, it'll do that."
"Again, there's really only two lines in it that do anything."
"The format one just does, just calls a replace along the string from the internal to the external."
The parsing just changes it backwards.
That's all you need to do.
"The only thing special, if you notice the first line in the parsed object, it was position set indexed string length."
You just have to set it to something.
"If you leave it at zero, Java will throw an exception for you."
"Just set it at something, keep Java happy."
There you go.
"Formats and parses, there's only really two lines of code."
"If you start using them, you'll find all kinds of places you can use them."
I like them a lot.
No comments?
- Position set index can be or even important if you're chaining format is to give one inside the other because you don't know where you're starting and ending in the paths for the next one.
"- Yes, but usually I try to keep them fairly simple."
Okay.
"So the war is a real presence, even on the college campus: drilling students, fighting men, guns stored in the Yale library, people having a hard time getting food and supplies."
1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year of violence in New Haven; that is the year when the
British invaded New Haven.
"And Ezra Stiles, who was President of Yale at the time, noted in his diary the events as they unfolded-- and again, it's really interesting to see his diary entries."
"He later wrote another account that had full sentences, but to me what was more interesting-- and I'll read some of them here--were some of his diary entries because they're really immediate, and he's kind of recording his reaction to events as they're happening."
"So on July 4,1779, he says he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been seen near"
"Bridgeport, and supposedly rumor said it was heading to New Haven."
"So again, being the responsible president of Yale, he asks for militia to be sent."
"In case this is actually true, they're going to need some real soldiers, but he writes in his diary:"
"""Would not believe the enemy intended landing."""
Okay.
He hears the rumor and he takes action but he actually literally cannot believe that the British are actually going to get off the ships and attack.
That can't be real; can't be really happening.
"The next day, July 5, Stiles, using a telescope, says that he ""saw the ships distinctly from the steeple of College Chapel"" and, he continues,"
"""Began to remove all property...."
Militia meeting.
Tories calm.
"With telescope from the tower or steeple clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little after sunrise."""
"He sees the smaller boats going off of these ships, with soldiers, to land on the shore."
"""Immediately, I sent off College records and papers ... and a bag of my own things,"" sent his family away."
"The next day, July 6, Stiles writes:"
"""Enemy paraded."
"Sailors came on shore and took their turn at plunder."""
"I'm going to continue a couple days here and then go back to the actual invasion, just because the series of things he writes here are interesting and they become weirdly personal, which again reminds me that this is a real person's experience."
He says:
"July 7,11 o'clock p.m., ""enemy landed and burnt Fairfield."""
"July 8, ""Removing my furniture""-- (he's now moving his furniture out of Yale) --"
"""Removing my furniture broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer which I have had since 1762."""
[laughter]
"I was like: oh, okay, I feel sorry you're moving your furniture and he broke his thermometer."
"July 12, ""the whole town moving,"" and then July 23 this little, tiny reminder that Yale is still an institution that exists."
The story started when Dr.
"Jaggers, who was Jessica's surgeon, received a phone call by the New England"
Organ Bank in the middle of the night.
The New England Organ Bank offered him the organs for another one of Dr. Jaggers' patient.
"Dr. Jaggers felt that the organs were inappropriate for this as a patient, But in part of the phone call, asked if they could use them for Jessica."
The New England Organ Bank somehow assumed that if Dr. Jaggers was asking for the organs for
"Jessica, they would match the blood type."
Vice versa is the work flow at the Duke
Transplant Center and Dr. Jaggers explicitly assumed that if the New
"England Organ Bank were offering the organ for Jessica, they would check the blood type."
"At the end of the day, nobody checked."
"In the aftermath of Jessica's death, a group experts were put together to assess what went wrong in this process."
They estimated that about one dozen caregivers had the opportunity to notice a mismatch.
"Typically, a single mistake in this type of process would have been caught."
"If one person forgets to check the blood type, well, there are eleven others who could have noticed."
"But if twelve people, at the same time, all make a defect at once, the outcome is tragic."
"British psychologist, James Reason, has developed a model to explain accidents and disasters."
This model is referred to as the Swiss cheese model.
The idea of the Swiss Cheese models is as follows.
Think about a slice of Swiss Cheese.
"In the slice, we have a couple of holes and we think of a hole as a defect."
"Now, the Swiss Cheese model, which doesn't look at one slice of cheese in isolation, but asks what happens when you stick multiple slices of cheese on top of each other."
"With a certain small, but positive"
"likelihood, you can stack up the slices of cheese and all the defects line up and the outcome is tragic."
This is the idea of redundancy.
As you add multiple layers of cheese on each other.
"It is less and less likely that you can see though all the slices at once,"
"But, again, the outcome probability is still not zero."
So what's the probability of a defect in a situation like this?
"Now, if we draw this as a process flow diagram, redundant check typically corresponds to a parallel path in the process flow diagram."
I've illustrated this here with these three paths that are all happening on the way of producing this flow unit.
"Now, the orange boxes here are the redundant test point."
I wasn't very good at reading things.
"In fact, I don't read much of anything."
"I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do."
"But instead, I go out and I find things."
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
(Laughter)
"And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things."
"And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones."
"And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years."
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
"And so, at that time,"
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
"We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds."
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
"In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults."
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
(Laughter)
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
"And in his book, he talked about the social animals."
"And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures."
"The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of ""Jurassic Park."""
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
"You all know the story, right."
"I mean, I assume everyone here has seen ""Jurassic Park."""
"If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out."
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
(Applause)
"""Open Architecture Network"" is an amazing project that brings together the world's designers and architectures to collaborate and do stuff that anyone could not do."
It's a beautiful site that gets better every month.
"We had ""Pangea Day."""
James Nachtwey brought the story about TB.
"""The encyclopedia of Life"" has been built, that's a massive project that TED was part of."
"""Once Upon a School"", ""Next Einstein in Africa"", and this ""Charter for Compassion"". are just some of the ones that have been done."
"So, the kerfuffle was over, you know,"
"TED numbers started to grow, and it really started to feel like there was something good going on and the puzzle was, how could you get these ideas that were exciting people in the conference?"
Could you get them out into the world at large somehow?
"So, if you wind the clock back a bit to when I started the foundation that owns TED,"
I was really obsessed with this question: how do you make a difference?
How do you leverage money spent to really have maximum impact?
"And, I thought about these 5 things, all of which have massive amplification of human attention."
"And, then, it hit me that there was really a bigger thing that encompasses them all."
"And if you focused on that, you know, that might be the way to go."
"Think about ideas, you know, they start off as these little electrical patterns in someone's brain, you know, they weigh nothing. but they occur in the right circumstances, can spread to another brain, they can excite the body that houses that brain to do stuff, and if you're lucky, pass on the pattern to other people."
The ideas do the work for you.
That's a really amazing thing.
"And so we wondered how we could let the amazing ideas that happen at TED, which are after all the most infectious ideas I have ever seen, boy, if you could see those into the world, what might happen?"
And how to do it?
"I hired a woman, June Cohen to help me figure out the answer to this question."
"She is an experience media executive, long-term TEDster."
"And our first shot was television, you know, big audience."
We thought TED talks would look fantastic on TV.
"Unfortunately, all the TV executives we spoke to didn't see that."
We got nowhere.
"And so in 2006, we thought we do a little experiment, and just try putting a few of them up ourselves on the web, and see what happened."
We were worried that they would have none of emotional impact of the live event.
We were worried that TEDsters would be annoyed that stuff would be given away.
"But so, it was just an experiment."
"Majora Carter, Hans Rosling and Ken Robinson, these were three of the first ones we put up."
So in just this little sort of case study of New Haven and
"Yale, you can see how citizenship and"
"leadership came to have different meanings, how people were understanding what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in a different way as they lived the experience of fighting a Revolution."
Okay.
I ended that on time.
I even read my--I'm so impressed with myself--[laughs/laughter] the instant lecture.
Okay.
"And I ended two minutes early, so you have time to get your midterms."
"Have a wonderful spring break, and I will see you after."
"My name is Bacar Fati and I am vice president moreover, I am a founding member of the NGO Senim Mira Nassequê, and I am vice president."
"So, these people have been working from its creation for the training, information and awareness of people to abandon the pratices of... mainly female genital mutilation."
"But there is a broader activity of cutting, in the sense of putting an end to the practices especially with the NGO Saber Bom."
As we know of course that in our country there are many ethnicities that have those practices as part of their culture.
"So, in this moment we are doing a good work with the participation of other NGOs I think we are making an effort in that sense, and we are in the right way."
I am here today to take part of a training so that we can start producing and spreading our activities through blogging news.
"And today it is my second time in this activity so I think I am already learning and I have learned many things that allow us, from Senim Mira, to start spreading information about the activities we are promoting in different parts of the country."
"Right now we are in Bissau, but soon we will have another partnership indeed, the second partnership with the NGO (?) and that will help us a lot on implementing the activities in the field."
How do you show  two and three-digit numbers on a number line?
"In this lesson you will learn how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."
Let's review :
You know you can model 45 using place value tools.
If we used a place value board we know we would need four tens and five ones to show 45.
We can do the same thing with a three-digit number such as 253.
"We would need two hundreds, five tens, and three ones."
Two hundred fifty three.
A common misunderstanding when using number lines is thinking that number line models always count by or use units of one.
If we were to put fifty two on a number line...
Let's see what that looks like.
"Five tens, we know is fifty."
"And, we have two ones..."
Two jumps of... two more jumps?
"One, two."
"Cauliflower, when you get it, comes with this green stuff around and it's kind of hard to get in to."
"So, what I do is just peel back some of these leaves - get my knife in there and once you get a few pieces out, it gets easier."
"So, just pull those out."
"Once you slice one of them, you want to make sure to take one out because it will dry out."
"And since I slice this top off here, I want to take those as well, and the rest of it you can put back in its plastic bag and save."
"It is better if you can use the whole thing at once, but this is lunch for Phil and I, the entire cauliflower would be a bit much."
This is going to get dry out a little bit but just do the best you can.
I'm going to put it back into the plastic bag that it came in and pop it back in the fridge.
"So, you want to wash up your cauliflower, just make sure that there's not dirt or anything like that on it."
"One of the things that I really love with this kitchen is the first place that Phil and I had been that doesn't have a microwave, which is awesome because we don't use microwave and it kind of gets in the way of the use of space in the cupboards."
"The last place we lived in we used the microwave for storage actually, but cupboards are much more efficient, so we were excited about that."
"Alright, so get your cauliflower cut up and"
I'm going to cut it into bite size pieces.
"At his point, is you want to, you can steam this or boil it."
"I'm just going to have it raw because we're having it for lunch and lunch is when I like to get raw vegetables because it's the warmest part of your day and the most active and most able to handle those cooling raw foods, especially in winter time in Ottawa - it's pretty cold here."
"Alright, so there is Phil's bowl, he always eats more than me - he's a guy and bigger than I am."
I'm just going to pour some of the sauce over the top.
"You can use as much or as little as you like - that's look pretty good, some on mine."
Here you go my lovely simple garlic herb sauce recipe over cauliflower.
You can have a few chopped onions or some parsley on top there if you a garnish - it's very easy to make if you have a bean dip already made.
Hey!
Starting another The Moustache In The Kitchen!
Say hi to everyone.
Moustache:
"Hi, everyone."
The Moustache In The Kitchen
"Today we're going to make the vanilla sugar, which I had said to you..."
"That we would make with the remaining vanilla, which was supposed to stay drying,"
From the Confectioner's Cream episode.
"It can be used in cake, in Palmier's dough, can be used in dough's pie,"
It can be used in lots of things you want!
It's delicious and you reuse the vanilla.
It turned out they used it for animation.
If you wanted to move something over and over again you would do it on idle.
"It worked for that generation, but when the next generation of Macintoshes came out that were faster, suddenly all the animation went crazy and didn't work very well."
"The lesson from that was: if you don't provide a right way to do something, the street will figure out its own way."
"It turns out the browser learned from that, and so we've got set interval which was a correct response to this problem."
So HyperCard had a huge impact on the evolution of the browser.
"Basically, the Netscape 2 browser was an attempt to put HyperCard functionality into the browser."
"Not surprisingly, JavaScript is well suited to this model -- not surprisingly because JavaScript was invented specifically to do this."
"In fact, it does it really well."
"So as awful as the DOM is, JavaScript with the DOM is an effective programming environment."
You can actually get stuff done.
"If you put on top of the DOM an Ajax library -- say a good one like YUI 3- it's even better, it's way better."
One of the ways we're blessed here is that JavaScript does not have READ.
"It does not ordinarily break or halt, and that's a good thing."
"It's always been seen over its lifetime as a huge deficit -- 'JavaScript is bad because it can't READ' -- but it turns out that we're actually better off for it, because it's easier for us to think about event loops than people coming from other languages."
"It turns out you can do an event loop in any language, but we're better at it in JavaScript because we've never had this two mind thing where sometimes you block and sometimes you don't."
Being in a world where you never block just makes life easier.
"READ is bad because it blocks, and blocking is bad for event loops, and that's where we live in the browser."
JavaScript programmers are just smarter about using event
"loops than programmers in other languages, it's just a fact."
You guys are just smarter.
Event loop is just one approach to concurrency.
There are lots of others.
The most popular approach today is threading.
"Everything has trade-offs, everything has pros and cons, and these are some of the pros and cons of threading."
"First off, everybody knows what threading is, right?"
I don't have to define that?
Right.
"The first pro, and it's a huge one, is that no rethinking is necessary."
"Any time you come up with something and say 'and you don't have to rethink' it's like great, sign me up."
"I'm ready to do that, I'm ready to not have to think."
All of your bad habits work just fine under threading.
I recall the fish biting several hours later.
"But those times alone with him in a boat, on a lake, sharing thoughts, memories and laughter... no Christmas morning could top them."
I'm grateful for my Dad instilling within me the recognition of the value of a family.
"Upon marring my wonderful wife Katie and raising our three children,"
I gravitated to spending as much time as possible with them.
That meant perhaps sacrificing time with my Dad.
"None the less, I know he understood because he did the same with my mom, sisters and I."
He helped build a bond with a strength that was no more evident than our presence during the final days of his life.
"Finally, I'm grateful for my Dad for instilling within me the love of the Chicago Bears."
"As my friends who in attendance today will attest,"
I chose during my adolescent years to spend fall Sundays beside my dad agonizing the Bears losses and celebrating their wins.
"As I grew older, the phone would be our connection to chastise a poor play or simply yell into the phone to each other following a Bears touchdown."
"During my sport writing days I summarized the Bears Superbowl victory with a column confessing simply, that my love of the Chicago Bears was hereditary."
"I wrote at the time, ""As I think about the emotion that swells within me as I watch"
"'Brian's Song' for the umpteenth time,"
I see my father sitting in his easy chair.
Heredity is a difficult facet of life to ignore.
"My love for the Bears, I have come to realize, is all in the genes."
Chicago Bears - Superbowl Champions.
It has the ring of a Christmas wish.
"Well, Dad, here's to our wish finally coming true."""
"Dad, my wish today is that you have a heart-to-heart with the good lord."
To ensure a certain team from Chicago performs to the level that provides us and you with the satisfaction of another Superbowl victory in 2013 in your honor.
"And dad that you also find your peaceful lake, accompanied by Uncle Bob and Kevin, enjoying in the laughter and your limitless catch."
"And that you look down upon us in peace, knowing that your success on this earth has been measured by the love you family shares."
"And from that regard, no one in this room could be considered richer."
"My friends, the information you are about to witness from all of my years of research is the most important."
Its been hidden in plain view the entire time.
This is the ultimate secret and its about to be exposed.
THE ULTlMATE SECRET EXPOSED.
FOOD.
"I have hundred of government document, text books, white papers where for over 80 years the Elite of the western world have talked about adulterating food and water to sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics its all covered in the book "" Ecoscience "" written by the White house science czar John.P.Holdren."
"I've got a lot of time on my hands, but I don't, you know what I mean?"
"So, anyway... open mic. michaelthomas_2: ...three hours a day Monday through Friday."
"I'm looking at the prices here on Paltalk and Ghost, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you have the premium plan, which cost you $250 a month, or $249 a month."
"That means over four years Ghost spent over $12,000 giving us this time of his life and I didn't get a nap until today but that is a lot of money, man and we really appreciate you doing that for us."
"Well, yeah, $12,000 even for a rich man, that is not a small chunk of change."
That's not somethign you sneeze at.
"No, I really appreciate it man, thank you."
"Well, yeah, he can afford it, that's not the point."
It's still--
Ghost:
"Hey, this is what I""m talking about, man."
"Unappreciative, man."
You can give everything to everybody for free but they don't appreciate a goddamn thing.
"I mean, this is pretty much the synopsis of what people can get from this little Internet exercise here."
All right?
"I mean, this is much like the po' in America."
"You can give them a free house, a free car, a free job, free healthcare, free everything, but you know what?"
"They're still gonna bitch and they're still gonna be like,"
"""Yeah, man."""
GuitarNinja:
"It's a sad fact, but a lot of people are really unappreciative about everything."
"But, you know, I gotta agree with Mike Thomas, a lot of us here are very appreciative of everything you've done and the time, effort, and capital you have put into this."
"I mean, I was a bleeding heart liberal until about January of 2011,"
"I was like, had Occupy started earlier,"
I probably would've been in there and a big part of what kind of changed me into the
"I guess, call me a capitalist, you know, into the capitalist conservative, not conservative, but the kind of person I am now."
"A big part of it was listening to your show and getting the information from someone who wasn't you know, liberally slanting it and you knwo,"
"I definitely appreciate everything and don't ever think that the past couple years have been for no-- you know, there are those of us who are appreciative of it, but it is unfortunate there are a lot of people who aren't."
Never think that you wasted your time or money.
YOu have created a lot of capitalists out of this.
Ghost:
"I appreciate all the kind words in the chatroom, man but I don't see this as a --- you know, I feel bad for the people that really appreciated the show and appreciate what we were trying to do here that , you know, it's a little disappointing for them but it's good for me man, 'cause believe it or not man, my wife always told me taht this was a combination of it, man."

The college of Arts and Sciences is there for students to seek who they are and to become who they can be
Narrator:
It's the largest college at the University of Alaska Anchorage the College of Arts and Sciences a place where world class instructors are exposing students to possibilities that will begin to define their future
"David Edgecombe, Ph.D. Theatre Professor:"
I was talking to a student about directing and directing is all problem solving
"It's all making decisions, sometimes spontaneous decisions to change and affect what you are seeing in front of you and those problems, I think, can be very easily transferred to real world situations"
Eric Murphy:
Ph.D. Associate Professor of Psychology:
Whether one approaches the problem from an arts perspective or a natural science perspective what we are giving them is pretty much the toolkit on asking the important questions and then pursuing the answers to those questions on their own.
"Charles Crew, CAS-Psychology Student:"
How I decided
"I really wanted to get into helping to teach as well as helping to conduct research here on campus,"
I started to conduct my own research project in 2009.
I was definitely pointed in the right direction from faculty
like Dr. Murphy
"LeeAnn Munk, Ph.D. Depart Head-Geological Sciences:"
We feel like we've succeeded most when the student gets to the point where they are making their own discoveries.
"Hillary Jochens, CAS-Geology Student:"
"This semester, for example,"
"I'm taking an economics class, which is so pertinent to geology, and all the English that I've done, and the art, and everything"
It does.
He's going to drive down the price even more.
You can see it over here.
"If they increase quantity beyond this market quantity of 75, 37.5 each, if we go beyond that, the price that they would be selling at, at that quantity over there, is lower than the average total cost."
"You're going to be, the total economic, the average economic profit per unit is going to be negative."
There will be a total of negative economic profit.
Neither of them will want to produce more from this state either.
"All of a sudden in this topless state, holding others constant; if you hold A constant, B can't gain by changing his strategy, and if you hold B constant"
"A can't gain by changing his strategy, so we are, up here, in a Nash equilibrium."
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"Like the prisoner's dilemma, it was not the optimal state."
"The optimal state was here, but because they both wanted to cheat, they both wanted to do this one-upmanship, they both broke their contracts, they could end up in this state over here."
But this state is stable.
There's nothing holding the other party equal.
"There's nothing that they could do to change, to optimize."
"What they could do, and this is not what Nash applies to, they could say okay, we've been really ruining each others' business."
Let's go coordinate again and I'm going to decrease production if you decrease production.
"That is not, and they could maybe try to go back to this state, and that does not mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium because by coordinating again we're not holding the others constant."
We're saying I'm changing my strategy while you're changing your strategy.
Maybe only through another agreement they could go over here.
That still doesn't mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium.
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"If there's no coordination, if you hold one player constant, the other player cannot change their strategy, or change their production, for a gain."
Cameraman:
We are from God and to him we return.
Put him on his back.
Cameraman:
These are the mercenaries.
"First man, out of shot:"
These are the people he is using to help him.
He's been shot in the chest.
Another man:
"They wanted to burn him, disfigure him."
(laughter)
"No, I say that jokingly, but its true."
I get a huge luxury that when I make my videos
I pretend that the students are so enthralled by what I have to say that I can just imagine it.
And what's good about that is that it gives me energy...
"It's much harder to sit in front of a room full of 30 kids and you're not sure whether some are getting it, some are there, some are here."
"What happens is that.. that energy gets conveyed in the videos and when the students watch it, they can pause and repeat as many times as they want."
I just got a letter from a kid who watched one video 30 times and it took him 30 times to get the idea.
And what he said was that there no one on the planet that he could have paid to tutor him that constant 30 times without judging him.
And I think that's what students really like.
Tom:
"You do have a non-profit, you're out there in the universe of cyberspace but are any of the educational systems in this country"
- the districts - either at the local or state level - coming to you and saying 'how can we strengthen the relationship between what we need and what you do?'
Sal:
"Yes, we started some pilots last year, just almost on a whim and its gotten pretty exciting."
"Some of the local schools in the Bay Area, they said: 'what would you do if you could do anything you wanted with a 5th grade classroom?"""
"We said that we'd have every student working at their own pace: watching videos, doing the self-paced exercises."
Only moving forward once they'd mastered concepts.
Right now you get a 'B' or a 'C' on a topic.
"That's fine, you passed, even though you don't know 10 or 20% of the material."
And then you move on to more difficult topics.
"So we are saying everyone at their on pace, master concepts first and then what happens to the teachers is that they get all of this data: who is working on what, what videos are they watching."
What exercises are they doing.
So the teacher no longer has to give these 'one size fits all' lectures.
The teacher can actually get the data and say:
"""Hey look, Tom's having trouble with negative numbers, and everyone else is working at their own pace,"
"let me sit down next to Tom and actually have a 1-1 intervention with Tom."""
What we've found in the classrooms has been pretty crazy before maybe 10% of the teacher's time was spent on that really deep 1-1 mentorship.
Now it is 90% of their time.
So what we consider to be the relevant metric which is the student-to-time-with-the-teacher ratio.
That's gone through the roof.
Tom:
"Now here, you can use their attention to see your ad and take some action."
"Of course you need the human resources, the people, the talent to do that."
- It mostly depends on brains.
You don't need to build or to invest heavily in factories.
"- It could be an area where Portugal could invest in, and make a large return, without needing a very big investment in machines."
"- From the early stages, we decided to divide the company in business teams, without departments."
"There is no department of design, or department of development, ... all that stuff."
"All the teams are businessteams that have business people and technical people together, working for the same purpose and for the same team."
"So all you see around our office, is businessteams of 12-15 people maximum, working together in a circle shape."
So everyone works together.
- We got a digital label to work with us and we'll be on a compilation that has different bands from all over the world that play garage rock.
And we were selected to represent Portugal.
- My day job is in school.
I teach Portuguese to foreign learners.
- I'm a designer ... ... of machines.
- I'm an architect.
"- Wel, when I'm not playing in a band, I like to be a photographer."
- Portuguese are people with a high degree of imagination and a high degree of flexibility.
"Both of these aspects have helped us in building a good IT system, adapting it to the needs of our customers."
"- Centre of innovation, of technology."
"It's the centre of tradition, of history, of modernity, of wonderful people. of good food, of good weather."
Everything!
"Oh, Lisbon, it's one of the favourite cities for having international congresses."
So we are at the top.
"- So we're in a group, and there are several other companies there as well, tourism-connected or communication, and event-makers."
So it's all a big synergy of competences.
"It's easy, when you know what you're doing."
"And if you have time enough in advance to prepare all the details, because it's a business built on details."
"And to be prepared for all kinds of ""unexpected""."
So if you are already prepared for what you know is going to happen then you also have time and availabiity to take care of those things that you don't know.
"It's fingerspitzengefuhl, yes, that's for sure."
"This specific congress, as is the case for most of them, is marketed primarily through the website."
Do you have any advice following the Arab spring that just hit the middle east?
For the rest of black Africa that is still facing some sort of oppression?
"We see a year later what's happening with the Arab Spring and now in the Arab world, in Egypt we see how difficult it is to really allow freedom to take hold, but you've got to start the process."
You can't romanticize or demonize Africa.
You've got to take it for what it is and then engage the larger world and use every resource available to try to change it.
"Well, Dr. King said injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
"So he would have embraced people in the Arab Spring, he'd talk about Occupy Wall Street"
"To hammer home the point that people should not be oppressed, and that we must open the doors of opportunity for all."
His words seem to have the sort of premonition that is so poignant upon every relistening.
"Every time we hear them again, well I don't know what will happen to me now, but it really doesn't matter because I've been to the mountain top."
And you can hear the people responding.
Ha ha!
"And he said I've looked over and I've seen the promised land stretching, seeing out in a melismatic Sam Cooke like [singing] that's old school."
That's for the old people.
Don't worry.
Dr. King would have warned against the kind of vigilant hyperbole that existed in the aftermath of Barack Obama's ascent to the presidency.
From King's assassination to Barack's inauguration
"We know that the impact of King's death is monumental, opening up space for the very conception that the black man could lead this nation."
He also would've been critical of him.
That was his role.
That was his job.
"He was a prophet, not a politician."
Some people think that Barack Obama is Moses when his job description says he's pharoah.
Which means then that you're in the business of occupying political space to bring about the greatest outcome for the most citizens in your nation.
That means compromise in a way that prophets find problematic.
I think that Dr. King would have been deeply troubled by the persistence of inequality and he would've pushed rather vigorously for the relief of the most vulnerable in our society.
Neither the democrats of republicans speak about poverty.
They keep talking about the middle class like everybody middle class.
There are millions of poor people in this nation!
And Martin Luther King Jr. loved them and died with poor people!
Martin Luther King Jr. opened up this rhetorical resistance to American culture.
At its best hip hop tells the truth.
"Salts, you know, sodium, all of that will damage the soil and damage your plants."
"You want to avoid boron or borate, that's also going to damage your plants."
"And chlorine bleaches obviously, you know, kills things; you don't want to send it outside."
The next thing to kind of just get a little more informed is there's a lot of chemicals in our personal care products that are really just not good for us.
"And it's not really a plant issue or a Greywater issue, but it's often a good time when people are going to reuse their water, they want to think about well, what's in this stuff I'm using?"
"And so, if you're interested in doing a little more researches to database, it's called cosmeticdatabase.org."
And you can enter any product and they'll tell you what's in it.
"You know things are, oftentimes, it's kind of shocking to do this."
Any of you guys tried this?
Not yet? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"I think it's frightening, so be ready if you want to go down that route."
But it's definitely informative.
You can find out all sorts of things about the products.
And then the other thing is there's products that are recommended.
"So if you don't want to do lots of research, you know, we can tell you what products that we've researched and found to have no salt, no boron and not a lot of other carcinogenic things that are in a lot of products."
"So here are just a few examples like Oasis, Biopac, Ecos, Aubrey"
"Organics, there's more too."
"So, I'm going to talk about kind of some basic things with"
Greywater and this is just for the first way that outdoor simple systems.
"And a lot of times, it's really--Greywater is this unique source of irrigation."
So that's kind of common sense knowledge with other types of irrigation don't really fit with Greywater.
So it's important to kind of understand it and see the different kind of do's and don'ts of Greywater irrigation.
"So the do's, the things you want to do is mulch."
It's a really important component of a system.
You guys know what mulch is?
"Yeah, it's just like woodchips, you know, things covering up your landscapes so it's covering the soil."
Mulch is really important for Greywater.
You also--you always want to have a way to go back to the sewer.
"It's called a three-way valve, and Greg's going to show you one example in a sec."
You want to use plant-friendly products because it's going outside.
"And then you want to use--I put a proven designing clothes because there's, you know, so many different ways you could get your water outside."
"And there's lots of ways people can tinker and, you know, get it to go out there."
So thank you and thank you for listening.
(Applause)
"Hello, and welcome back to Introduction to Genetics and Evolution."
In the previous videos we looked at how to study the process of recombination.
And specifically how we can leverage recombination to actually map genes associated with diseases.
"And again, as I've said several times, we are looking for an association."
"Between alleles at markers, such as these hapmap SNP markers that we discussed, and a phenotype such as disease status."
That is essentially the what we're trying to do with genetic mapping.
"Now what we're gonna do in this video is, we're gonna actually try to map simple genetic traits."
So traits controlled by one gene that have a very large effect on that trait.
Relative to genetic markers [inaudible].
So.
We can actually use hat map markers just
like we use it for soft limitations in previous videos to map simple genetic [inaudible].
"So remember we did these problems using these three [inaudible] markers, a, b and c."
"And we did the case of the test cross with an individual that was heterozygous for all three, so it gave little a, big b, little b, big c, little c."
"Crossed to somebody who, who's homozygous."
"Little a, little a, little a, little b,"
"little c, little c, little c."
"Now we can imagine that A and B are snip markers with, you know, so they necessarily have two or more oleos, and that they have a known location in the genome."
Now what we can say now is maybe C is the disease gene.
"So what we're trying to actually do with a lot of genetic mapping, this isn't all of mapping but part of mapping, is to determine whether C, the diseased gene is between a certain pair of markers."
"And secondarily, about how far is it?"
"Like is it, for example, between A and B?"
"And if so, is it closer to A or is it closer to B?"
"Or is it off to one side, maybe out passed"
A and further away from B?
That is genetic mapping.
"So let's, let me illustrate this with an example."
I will be using concepts very much like what we did with [inaudible] mapping of genes.
Let's use cycle cell anemia.
"Now this disease is recessive, meaning you have to have two copies of the mutant type to exhibit the disease."
ladder.
"Remember, this was the instant when the right side of the ladder pokes out of the right side of the garage, and so I look at this equation and I say x prime two is equal to L, so I say L over here."
"And that is going to be equal to'x',"
'x' is'g' because it's at the right side of the garage and then minus'v' times't2' and then divided by the square root'1' minus'v' squared of over'c' squared.
"And okay from this I can solve, everything here is known, except for T2."
"So I multiply by the square root as I'm always doing, move the square root over to here."
"Notice I get the foreshortened length here, and what I find moving things around is that vt2 is G - L * the square root of one - v^2 / c^2 by construction we said that this is less than G so vt2 is positive because I was running fast enough."
"This number is small enough, the Lorentz constructed ladder fits into the garage."
"That means its right end will emerge from the garage after the left end entered. perfect that's what we set up in the garage's frame, the ladder fits into the garage."
How does this look in the ladder's frame?
Well and indeed there is this whole time as I said between the time the left end enters and the time that the right end exits that the ladder is completely contained in the garage.
Good for us.
"On the other hand, what happens if I look at the same thing from the point of view of the ladder, what I want to know is at what time did as measured by the"
"ladder, did the right end of the ladder exit the garage, so I want't' prime at this same event."
That turns out to be easier to extract from the inverse transformations.
So again x is equal to g.
So I put it g over here.
Over here x prime is equal to l.
"And I want T prime, so again I can solve for T prime."
And I find that V T prime again multiplying through the square root.
"I find that'vt' prime is one over, the square root of one minus'v' squared over'c' squared times'g' minus'l'."
"Now, G is less than L, this is a number less than one."
"T2 prime is negative. remember that T2, T prime = zero and also, Tzero, = zero was the time when the left end of the garage entered the garage."
"But here, the right end of the garage emerged before."
"So indeed, in the I adder's frame of reference, the ladder was never in the garage."
You couldn't close both doors.
"Because, as far as the ladder is concerned, before the tail end of the ladder entered the garage, the front end of the ladder was protruding."
"So what happens you ask if the garage owner in his frame when the ladder is completely as he sees it contained in the garage, swiftly closes both doors."
"Well, lets follow that in a graphic representation which will give us a chance to play with space time diagrams and see some of their strengths and limitations."
We could also do the calculation this way but I wanna demonstrate a graphic method of solution.
So hopefully.
"What we, what did we get from here?"
I pay nothing.
If there was some initial membership charge then maybe we would add that membership charge and you would pay the monthly fee after that.
"But here this looks about right, that the dollars paid is equal to 40 times the time in months."
The time in months is the independent variable.
"It drives the dependent variable, the number of dollars you pay."
"So these are turkeys, and this is electrified also."
This is space age stuff.
There's a little stainless steel filament.
See it running through the horizontals?
"These, the verticals, are dead."
The horizontals carry the spark.
This is really a major breakthrough in pastured farming.
"This poultry net material, we get ours from"
"Premier in Iowa, it's only been around for about 20 years and it took computer chips to be able to shorten the spark length down to 4 thousands of a second, to get the resistance"
load low enough so it wouldn't melt the polyethylene.
"So this is why I say, I am not a [indistinguishable] by any stretch, we embrace technology."
"But it's cool that this netting comes in a 150 foot roll, weighs 12 pounds, one person can take it up and put it down in 10 minutes, and it keeps out bears, coyotes, wolves, possums, skunks, racoons, and keeps the turkeys and chickens in, and all those predators out."
Who would have guessed that you could have that eighty years ago.
I noticed that there's no covering
like we see with the chickens.
"Is it because at this stage, at their size, the aerial predators don't become an issue."
"Exactly, at this point the aerial predators are not an issue."
"The group over there is three weeks younger, than this group here, this group is eleven weeks old, that group over there is eight weeks old."
Are they getting ready to harvest?
"No, they'll go to sixteen weeks."
"Again, what keeps us awake at night is trying to figure out how to scale these things, and all that."
"So this is a ""gobbledy go"", this is the latest ideology of a portable turkey structure."
"This thing is 32 feet long, 12 feet wide, these are roosts here."
"But the thing to notice is, they're just lodged boards."
So these purlins up here are just lodged.
"The point is that in five minutes you can pop all these off, pop the purlins off, fold up the shade cloth, now you're down to just eight feet, hook up to a pick up truck, and you drive down the road at 55 miles an hour."
And why do you have these in here for?
"And we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech, with a big, long pole."
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
And we were very effective.
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
Half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time.
"But it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like."
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
"One, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark."
"We also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well."
These are archival tags.
What they do is store the data.
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite.
"And sharks and fish are underwater most of the time, so this tag actually works out the locations of shark, depending on the timing and the setting of the sun, plus water temperature and depth."
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
"What happens is, you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period -- in this case, eight months -- and literally to the day, the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use."
This is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they're underwater.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.
"In that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry."
"Basically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters."
"On Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge."
"Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet with sea-surface temperature and water depth, but again, the second shark spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea."
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
Nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened.
Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
His tags didn't really work.
"All he knows is where he tagged them, and where they popped off."
"His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil."
"We thought basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in our latitudes, but in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well."
"So very simple things like that, we're trying to learn about basking sharks."
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
Although one of them has been mildly successful in early stage of Alzheimer's.
"So, clearly, Alzheimer's therapy has a very long way to go."
Next time we will continue or discussion of neurodegenerative diseases by talking about Parkinson's disease.
"Here's another nearest neighbor example, and now I'm going to ask a different question."
"Given all the black data points,"
I want to make sure that the red ones are classified as indicated and I am free to choose a different value for K.
"Say I can choose K to be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9."
Check any or all of the K values for which you believe these 3 data points are classified correctly relative to the black training data set.
"In the celebrated example of Prisoner's Dilemma, we have this general scheme where the two prisoners can either cooperate or not."
"Defect, as it's called."
"If they both cooperate, they get some payoff A."
"If they both defect, they get a different payoff D, where A is greater than D."
"However, if they miscoordinate and one of them cooperates and the other defects, then the cooperator gets the lowest possible payoff and the defector gets the largest possible payoff."
And that's true symmetrically here as well.
And this very well known example has a rather counterintuitive paradoxical properties.
Most games are not as conceptually confusing.
Here's an example that's conceptually very clear and these are games of pure competition.
"The situation here is limited to two players, where one player's payoff is exactly the compliment of another player's payoff."
"So, they always add to some constant c."
Often that constant we use is zero.
"And we call it, for that reason, zero sum games, as opposed to constant sum games."
"And since they do sum to zero or to a constant, we only need to remember one number, the pair to one of these and we can infer the payoff to the other player from that."
Here's the most simple version of it.
This is a game of matching pennies.
So you and I each need to pick heads or tail for the coin.
"If we pick the same side, either heads or tails, I win."
Which means that I get a payoff of one and you have minus one.
"If we miscoordinate, and so I pick heads and you tails or the other way around, then you win."
A very straight forward game of pure competition.
"Here's another very well known similar game with three actions from both of us and that's the game of rock, papers, and scissors, also known as rochambo."
"So, if we pick the same action then it's a draw."
And otherwise there are rules for who wins.
Let's pour some drops of methylated spirit in a bottle and spread them on the inside wall so that the methylated spirit well vaporise.
"Blow a lot of cigarette smoke into the bottle by using a straw, until the content becomes opaque."
"Light a match, and throw it in the bottle containing smoke and alcohol vapours."
Alcohol vapours burn instantly.
"Right after, there's no more smoke inside the bottle."
Alcohol combustion produces very hot gases which expand and escape through the bottle opening.
Smoke particles are carried away by gases that escape.
Smoke disappears instantly from the bottle.

I have in fact until 21.12 2012 to awaken the slumbering inhabitants of the earth and get them to take care of their self-made crises.
"21.12 2012 is, as you know expectence of the transition to the big change, the change of paradigm, in knowledge vision, as the ancient Mayan Indians talking about and it may well be the beginning of a new era, scary and a little exciting, especially for you perhaps, and I will therefore every week until 21.12 get visits by an expert in earth and space, and together we must try to identify and solve the world crises and today's crisis in the studio is philosophy."
Wisdom was a very popular concept in ancient greece.
"It was so popular that a man named Pythagoras said that he was ""Filosofía"" infact that he loved the goddess of wisdom, Sophia."
"So the philosophy was born and it was the beginning of a large number of schools from which all science stems from, but in time science was parted from philosophy and then personal development and spirituallity was parted from philosophy, and final death blow the philosophy got in the present which means we know all philosophers by heart but completely we forget to think for ourselves."
"People forgot that philosophy means ""love of wisdom"" and not just knowledge itself."

Q: what are the obligations of GAP up nowadays?
A:
"Gap is based on reach middle school and recently, we also open with universities."
"Our core is in Fortaleza, Sobrau, Joào Pessoa, and Moçorò."
"Gap exists to create a means by which the Church can exercise his vocation, exercising the gifts that we have received by the grace of God."
"Therefore, this passion allows us to to influence young people, which nowadays are continually bombarded by the sinful seductions of this modern era and help them maintain their fire for Christ."
This helps them a lot.
"So we're on the road with tent giving space to the work of Christ bearing witness of lives transformed, the recovery of those who have gone astray, and in rebellion to God."
Q: how long are you in business?
A:
By 12 years.
Q: how's the dialogue with the Church?
A: it is difficult.
We are sometimes hesitant.
"Unfortunately there are many churches where leaders are interested in other things, thus deluding their members ... so we are sometimes unsure in making the first step."
"Mostly when it comes to activities, sometimes distrust of us because sometimes it seems that we are depriving them of their members."
"There are pastors who admire what we do, and pray for us, but more often than not we are left alone."
"We have pastors that we depend on, obviously."
The Ministry is under the pastoral care of a church.
Q:
"In these 12 years, how many missionaries have maintained?"
"A: we have never supported anybody, only now we are sending the first missionary."
"But as far as preparation is concerned, we have prepared about 400 young people."
The fact is that our joy in Christ is giving the possibility to people to vote according to their vocation.
"This serves to keep people from what is ""Babel syndrome"", i.e. making a name and putting himself in competition with Christ."
"Then there are Christian missionaries movements at universities, ranging from Ministers that have been prepared by Gap."
This is something that makes us very thankful to God.
"Q: talking about you primarily, in these 12 years, you are devoted mainly to Gap?"
A:
"In these 12 years, many things are interlaced between my personal life and Gap."
"I have a doctorate in theology, and I am the Director of Gap, but"
I had to delay my studies due to commitments with Gap when we were at the beginning.
Go back over here to this side and I've got to make everything now consistent with what's going on there.
Okay.
"Let's start off with our constructor, which is a good place to make sure you get into a valid state."
"In this case, we're going to use the empty list so the head pointer points and tells us we have no cells whatsoever in the list."
"So we don't pre allocate anything, we don't get ready."
What's kind of nice with this linked list is to allocate on demand each individual cell that's asked to be added to the list.
The delete operation actually does show we need to do some work.
"I'm actually not going to implement it but I'm going to mention here that I would need to delete the entire list, which would involve, either iterates or recursion my way down to kind of do all the work."
And then I changed this from size to iterate.
I'd like to know if my list is empty.
"So I can just test for head is equal, equal to null."
If it's null we have no list.
Let me work on push before I work on pop.
I'll turn them around.
"The push operation is, make myself a new cell."
"All right, let's go through the steps for that."
New cell equals new cell
T. [Inaudible] the size to hold a value and an X link.
I'm going to set the new styles val to be the perimeter that came in.
"And now, I'm going to splice this guy onto the front of my list."
So the outgoing pointer I'm doing first to the new cell is allocated and
leads to what was previously the front row cell.
And then it is now updated to point to this one.
"We've got pointer wired, one value assigned, and we've got a new cell on the front."
"The inverse of that, taking something off my list, I'm going to need to kind of detach that front row cell, delete its memory, get its value, things like that."
So the error checking is still the same at the very beginning.
"Like, if I've got an empty staff I want to be sure I don't just kind of do reference no and get into some bad situations."
"So I report that error back using error, which will halt the program there."
"Otherwise, right, the element on top is the one that's in the value field of the head cell."
So knowing that head's null is a safety reference to do there.
And then I'm going to go ahead and get a hold of what that thing is and I'm going update the head to point to the cell after it.
So splicing it out and then deleting the old cell.
"And it's not like a rule book as much as guidelines so you can understand, this is why this will make your application better as you follow these various guidelines."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
It's some kind of another instance of
line stuff up.
Don't reinvent a new way to do a list unless there's a really good reason to.
"Unless it really changes the character of your thing and there's a purpose, there's no reason to invent a new kind of scroll bar."
AUDlENCE:
"For the Android design style guideline, I was wondering what you guys foresee in terms of how its evolution is going to be over time, especially with phone devices, mobile devices."
"The screen size is getting larger, and a lot of times"
"I've heard that you want to keep things closer to your thumb, but with things like the Action Bar Menu and the"
"Overflow Menu, it's so far away on a large device that you no longer have the ability to easily do single hand actions."
ALEX FAABORG:
Yeah.
"Well, on large devices you have the radius of thumbs on the edges."
You want to definitely think about that.
"And the style guide, it's evolving as fast as the ecosystem and the devices are."
"We're constantly pushing out updates, considering new patterns, things like that."
So it's not like this sort of fixed thing that everyone has to adhere to as much as a kind of organic living document as we all collectively learn more.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you for the phone number slide.
I really like that.
It reminded me of one of the horrible failures of iTunes that I've just been annoyed by.
"If you have a date, and you format it with four numbers, a dash, two numbers, a dash, and two numbers more, that should be in ISO format for year, month, day, and no other order."
If you're having sort of the other random orders that some
"locales like, then use the slashes or whatever is sort of standardized for that."
And it helps users so much.
ALEX FAABORG:
"Yeah and especially thinking about your users, because you're going to have your own date format that you're familiar with, but knowing who you're designing for is really important."
AUDlENCE:
I do have a question this time.
Can you talk about tools a little bit?
"I mean, Photoshop is the obvious one, but what other tools can you talk about?"
"Now, I think the parties are afraid, because people are so outraged."
"I would say, on the left and the right, knowing this presidential election is going to cost $2.5 billion dollars--obscene--the--if you add the congressional races, you're up to $5.8 billion--that just says that our system is broken."
"And I think that the two parties are worried about it, because the American people are starting to realize that it's very hard to keep calling our system a democracy when it's being run by a very small elite that is the shadow government."
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
"I don't have much money, but boy if I did"
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
"If I was a sculptor, but then again, no"
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
"I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do"
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
"Well, a few of the verses"
"Well, they've got me quite cross"
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see
I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
"Very, very exciting challenge."
Absolutely.
"So many possibilities. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think, at this point,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;with so many contestants,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's really about strategy, right? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yeah.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is the devil in the box.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really the only thing&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that you couldn't&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; put with the duck breast."
"I'll tell you what I want to keep, okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So Christine has an aide,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Under no circumstances can her aide interfere with the dish.
"I want to keep the kale,"
"I want to keep the sweet potato,"
I want to keep the duck.
"I think she's at a bit of a disadvantage, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;till they learn&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;how to work together.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With the 18 now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;this is your first chance&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to really scare&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and intimidate people too&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and be like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"""this is what I'm all about."""
- What would you do?
- I would start off by rendering &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that duck fat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;off the duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I would blanch the kale and then sweat that off in duck fat, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bake the sweet potato,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and do a really nice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;caramelized rhubarb&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with aged balsamic vinegar sauce."
"I am gonna pan-sear a duck breast with a sweet potato puree and sauteed kale in the duck fat, but the fact that there's no elimination on the end of this does help me feel a little more relaxed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Take full advantage of your 60 minutes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One stunning dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"At first, I saw that duck breast, and it was stunning, and I was really excited, but then I started thinking that I have a great dish that I thought"
I kind of want to hold onto and bring that out later in the competition.
So I'm thinking right now
"I just do what I know I can handle, which is a rhubarb little tartlet."
It's kind of like a crostada.
"I'm confident, because there's a few people who I think might be a little wet behind the ears, who might be trying to put too much on their plate."
"Yes, sir."
"Scott, what are you cooking?"
- A profiterole.
- What?
A larger profiterole with yams and a little bit of duck in there.
"This is, like, a serious competition."
I'm being very serious about this.
"A duck profiterole doesn't sound serious to me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
A five-spice pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree.
"Sweet potato and rhubarb, they go together?"
- I think so.
- Have you tasted before?
"Urgot's role is really, ""tanky fighter ranged carry who assassinates other carries"" and we didn't want to change that about him."
We just went too far with the last nerf on Acid Hunter.
"Cho'Gath is one of our oldest champions and he needed a tune-up, so we're making three upgrades:"
"We're quickening his cast times, fixing an issue where Rupture's delay before hitting was random, and making his Vorpal Spikes scale in size as Cho'Gath himself grows."
What do these changes mean for Cho'Gath?
"Sometimes we want to give longer cast times for gameplay reasons, like with Karthus's Requiem, but Cho'Gath is not one of those champions."
We found out that his cast times are really long so we're bringing them down to about a half second.
This is going to make Cho'Gath feel a lot better about chaining his abilities together.
"For Rupture, it was basically hitting somewhere in between .5 and .75 seconds randomly."
We fixed that bug and now Rupture's timing is consistent right in the middle of those two values.
Now Cho'Gath players can actually plan for the delay of the ability just like other skill shots in our game.
The Vorpal Spikes change really is more for fun.
"They do get bigger and hit more targets as he grows, and not with just Feast but skills like Lulu's ultimate or the Summoner Spell Surge."
This is going to make him a little bit stronger but mostly it's going to make him feel a lot better.
The Tribunal is about building a more sportsmanlike community.
"If you find hostile players in your game, remember to report them after the match."
"When a player receives enough reports, the Tribunal builds a case against him/her for community review."
"If you're level 20 or higher, head to the Tribunal to vote on cases and help shape the community for the better."
We're experimenting with new ways to reform players more effectively.
"We'll be distributing ""Reform Cards"" to players who receive punishment in the Tribunal."
Players who get punished will get a link in their email that shows them the case that the community reviewed.
This case has full chat logs and stats of the games so they can identify the behaviors they need to improve.

Hi there.
"I'm Tucker Balch, and this is Computational Investing, Part one."
"I hope you're doing great. this module is about information and the efficient market hypothesis and we're going to begin taking a look at something called event studies. objectives for this module we're going to look at what are the most common sources of information that you can leverage for investing. learn how information relates to company value and we're going to look at the three versions of the efficient markets hypothesis that are important and the, the, the effect of what we're doing here. and finally in this module we'll look at event studies, how they work and talk about the next assignment for you involving event studies. okay. now, nearly all quantitative-based investing is based on some kind of arbitraged model."
"And, and in, in particular, what we are looking at is an arbitrage between what the price of the equity is on the market and what we believe its, its true value is. so I'm going to draw a blue line here and let's, let's presume that that's the true underlying value of the, of the equity."
"How we, how we get that true value, that's a different topic, but let's assume somehow we know what it is."
"The, the arbitrage comes about when we well, we, we presume that the price on the market should be very close to that true value."
And if it diverges significantly that's an opportunity to either buy or sell the stock on the presumption that it's going to return back to its true value.
"So, if the quoted market price is significantly below the true value, that's a buying opportunity."
And we know the price is going to revert back to the true price or if it's significantly above the true value that's a shorting opportunity.
"And we presume that it's going to go back down to that true value. now another important thing to remember is let me save that real quick. another important thing to remember is that we're always talking here about, about market, market relative in the new image here, okay we're, we're looking for market relat ive value, you know, and, and in particular let me let me draw a line here where the, the, you know, the, the, the price of the market and by, by that I mean S and P 500 varies over time. we're looking for a value relative to that."
You can see that it actually doesn't technically take us to the error.
It takes us to the line after.
Sometimes these kinds of tools will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.
"So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues."
So let's go ahead and fix that one.
Okay.
"So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect parenthesis after them where the perameters are."
Even if it doesn't take any perameters it still expects parenthesis here.
Let's go ahead and add those in.
And again reload the page.
And we get to our next error.
And this one is way down on line 207.
"Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem is right here, ""this:currentTick"" should have a dot, as see down here, rather than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables."
"Okay, so now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318."
"And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we would use a colon to specify a member method."
"So, if we fix that and then reload the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left."
"And, those are the only ones that we put in."
"So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually."
"So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand."
...
"I've kept my eyes open and seen that a new time is coming and that something is happening to the people, that has never happened before."
And you see people walking around like you've never seen before.
"That's because all that was at the bottom, is now rising."
"And where there were one individual and another individual, there is now the mass, the mass- man."
"And one will stick together, and not go home to oneself any more."
"I can guarantee you that you'll get food while you're waiting, and that you'll get through this, safe and sound."
For now we are on the threshold of the land that belongs to us.
I don't fight anymore!
Take the chance!
"To the left, asshole!"
Get in behind Fatzer
Forwards!
"Những vụ trụ nảy lại sinh ra những vũ trụ khác nơi mà có thể có 1 bản copy chính xác của hệ mặt trời ,trái đất ,hay thậm chí của mỗi người trong chúng ta nơi mọi thứ cực kỳ giống nhau hoặc có 1 chút khác biệt nhưng những vũ trụ khác ở đâu vậy ? tại sao chúng ta không thể nhìn thấy chúng ?"
Bởi vì chúng ta ở 1 chiều không gian khác
Liệu đó có phải là sự thật ? nếu có các chiều không gian khác về hình dạng và kích thước cuộc thử nghiệm này sẽ tìm ra chúng câu hỏi không phải liệu chúng có tồn tại hay không mà là chúng có 1 2 3 hay 4 kiểu khác nhau
This sensationally means the universe sits in a sea of parallel universes.
"Imagine another world, a whole other universe... with a solar system and a planet exactly like ours."
"On this parallel Earth, there lives an exact copy of you."
You could be leading exactly the same life... but in another universe.
"Now, imagine an entirely separate universe... where you could be living a slightly different life... at the same time as you live this life."
"It may seem fantastic, incredible, and impossible... but there could be many other universes out there."
And now some of the world's leading physicists... believe that they have evidence to prove it.
We are experiencing an existential shock.
"Our worldview has been shattered... with the realization that, yes, there could be parallel universes."
"I mean, it's just a mind-boggling idea... that there may be, essentially... exact replicas of us out there in the vastness of space."
The idea of a parallel universe is part of our popular culture.
People all around us think of it every day... but usually in terms of fiction.
One of the real exciting things... is that scientists today are trying to see... whether parallel universes are a physical reality.
Amazing new discoveries about the true size of the universe... seem to indicate that all that we see... is not all that there is.
We humans have assumed...
"like ostriches with our heads in the sand... that just because we can't see something, it ain't there."
"When my grandma was a little girl, for instance... they still didn't know that there were other galaxies."
Now we know that there are... billions and billions of other galaxies out there.
"Remarkably, there may be four types of parallel universe out there."
"One kind could exist in the same exact space we're in... but it is so far away, we cannot see it or reach it."
"In another scenario, multiple other universes... could be in giant cosmic soap bubbles... adrift in a cosmic sea of giant bubbles."
Revolutionary developments have changed the entire landscape.
Data from outer space have given us a new look at cosmology... and satellite data indicates there could be parallel universes.
"In yet another scenario, many parallel universes... occupy the same space and time as our universe... but because they are in different dimensions... they are invisible."
"In yet another, all the laws of physics are different... so everything looks completely different."
New theories called string theories... are giving us worlds of higher dimensions.
Quantum physics at the microscopic scale... is also revealing to us the fact there could be parallel universes.
"To keep things simple, physicists have divided parallel universes... into different levels."
Meet the level-one parallel universe.
"So you want more workers and fewer machines, right?"
"Given the machines and workers, this is a perfectly substitutable production function."
The marginal rate of technical substitution is k over l.
"You're perfectly indifferent between these two, given that-- not perfectly substitutable, but at this point you're indifferent between the two."
"So given that you're indifferent and the machines cost twice as much, why not buy half as many machines?"
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"But then, if the machines cost twice as much, why buy any machines?"
JON GRUBER:
"Oh, that's very good point."
Because it's not a perfectly substitutable function.
My bad.
"If it was, if the production function-- great question."
Let's say the production function was of the form q equals k plus l.
That's perfectly substitutable production.
"Then you're right, in that situation you should only buy workers because they do exactly the same thing."
But that's not the case here.
This exhibits diminishing marginal product.
"So if you only bought workers, eventually each worker would do so much less that you'd be better off getting a machine."
"It's not perfectly substitutable, I misspoke before."
At the margin they have an equal effect.
"But as you get more and more laborers, they'll be less and"
"less productive, so eventually you're going to want to buy a machine."
But you're only going to buy half as many machines as workers.
You never want to buy one machine per worker.
"But you also don't want no machines per workers, because the workers won't have anything to do then."
"Here you'd want no machines per worker, right?"
"The optimal thing to do, if you have a perfectly substitutable production function, you'd only just buy the cheaper input."
"But that's not the case when you have diminishing marginal products, then you're going to use a combination of inputs."
But the combination used will be determined by the prices in the market.
Other questions about that?
"So now we can ask, just as we asked in consumer theory, how does a price change in the price of goods affect your consumption decisions, we can ask how does a change in the price of inputs affect your production decisions?"
"How did not bother with their own fame, and what they left behind."
look at these men as a reference to people who have preached the Gospel of Jesus and how they gave their lives for King.
"Although few have known their names, Christ was known by them."
Then the Ministry wanted to be blessed in the sight of God.
"Not importatevi if you were to give the failed, but worry about heavenly things."
"All your suffering will be rewarded in heaven, along with the prize that Christ gives to those who serve with the heart."
"I would that all the brothers that I listen to, who are Ministers of the Gospel, are encouraged by the fact that the Lord God is immutable."
"Present in any church, whether large or small, and if God exists, is a glorious Ministry, because it is God who invites us to parectipazione."
"I think that in heaven there will be big surprises with those names that are great in the Earth, which could also be there ..."
"But those serfs who give themselves in Amazonia, they push in places undreamed of ..."
Well those are the men of real success!
"The Ministry is not determined by the amount of people that you're hearing, but for the quality of the action of the Holy Spirit in their hearts."
Don't get discouraged if you're not under the limelight ...
Be aware that the message we preach is powerful to save both Jews and Gentiles.
"Preaching boldly, and believe that God will do this."
"And if God exists, certainly the Ministry shall be blessed."
Escape from the limelight even as if they wanted to show that you can be more important than God.
"Whether you're famous, eloquent, whether you're known, none of this is important."
The only important thing is that you his faithful in delivering what the word
"God says, and not what we want the word of God says."
The human results are not important.
Sermon and sowing the word of God.
"One day the Lord will reward your efforts, your comfort heart, and we rejoice in him."
"Between listening to a great preacher, unfaithful to God, but with a good rhetoric and eloquence, and listen to a simple preacher who is not very eloquent, does not have the gift of speech, but is faithful to Scripture."
Well I always listen to preferirò the second to the first.
"Be faithful, preaches the word ama Scriptures, loves Christ."
And you'll have success.
In the eyes of God.
Some time ago I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Carson in the United States.
I was very touched.
"Told by his father, who had written a book: ""memoirs of an ordinary Pastor"" In that Conference, there were about 8000 persons there present."
"Carson with great frankness told him that many of the shepherds who were listening, are pastors of small churches and anonymous, with poor growth and does not have his own chance to speak to an audience so large."
"Alternatively if you only have one copy, we, if you're heterozygous we refer to you as a carrier."
"That means that you probably had a parent that had the disease for example, not necessarily but you probably did."
"Now let's imagine you're, you're serving a"
"lot of families and you have multiple cases of carriers, these individuals that we know are heterozygous for the disease, having kids with affected individuals."
When I say affected individuals I mean ones who actually have the disease.
"So you're crossing somebody heterozygous for the disease, the carrier, with somebody homozygous for the disease."
So this is again just like the test cross we did before.
Well lets say you have the gene attached for the parents and for the offspring.
But you don't know what the gene is causing the disease.
This is a very important point.
You do not know what or where the gene is causing the disease.
When I say you have the gene attached to the parents and offspring I mean you have their genes attached for a bunch of genetic markers.
You don't know where among those markers the disease-causing gene is.
"So let's, let's focus on two genetic markers on chromosome eleven."
"Let's say that you've already, from something else you already have some idea that, that this disease is caused by mutation on chromosome eleven."
Which actually is true by the way for sickle cell anemia.
Let's say you have two markers.
Let's say the A marker is at this point.
There's a picture of chromosome 11's chromosome Let's say the A marker is that this location.
I just made this location up.
Don't worry about that.
Let's say big A big A might be an individual's homozygous for the letter C for the nucleotides C in that position.
Big A little A has T at one copy and C at one copy.
Little A little A has T at both copies.
"This is, this is irrelevant."
I just wanted to give you some idea what I mean when I'm saying these snip markers and big A and little A. So this something just to make it more real in the context of a DNA sequence.
The important thing is that A is over here on a chromosome and B in contrast a little bit lower down on the chromosome.
So what are we trying to do?
We're trying to see is the gene causing
Sickle Cell Anemia between A and B?
Is it down below B or is it at that little area above A?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
"So everybody is being slowly poisoning, with artificial coloring, artificial tastes, artificial flavoring."
Nothing will be artificial.
Everything in the future will be organically grown.
"The Venus Project calls for building cities in the sea, which would include research and learning centers dedicated to bettering the ecological conditions in our oceans."
We do have cities in the sea of many different designs.
The purpose of the city in the sea is an university at sea.
"It's to train marine scientists, marine biologists, and what they do is they restore the reefs, restore the damage."
The cities in the sea have units out away from the city.
It's called a wedge.
"It's made of concrete, and it's got cells in it."
And the concrete is towed out and mounted about a mile in front of an island.
"So, if a tsunami occurs, the waves are parted a mile out in heavy seas, you understand?"
That is how we deal with tsunamis.
Earthquakes are generally based upon pressures in the Earth that build up over time.
We will have sensors.
We can dig holes six miles deep today with mining equipment.
We could put sensors deep in the Earth that can let us know well in advance when the pressure build-up is occuring.
How much will it cost?
We don't have that problem in the future.
Do we have the resources to do it?
"Yes we do, and that is all that counts."
"The Venus Project's headquarters is located in a pristine area of south central Florida, USA, on a 9 hectare parcel of land."
The site features a research center and a number of other buildings designed by Mr. Fresco and Ms. Meadows.
"Within the structures are housed many models, illustrations, blueprints, and exhibits related to The Venus Project."
"The center runs informational workshops for the public, where participants are able to discuss Jacque Fresco's ideas face-to-face with him."
There will be many different types of buildings in the future.
Different people with different interests will want to select different types of buildings.
"But in most instances, most of the buildings are curvilinear."
They have curves or bent lines.
And that makes the building much stronger and uses far less material.
"So there would be lots of deck space on buildings so that people can relax, as you notice all the deck space on these buildings."
But people will pick a building that suits their profession and their interests.
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now.
This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
"And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor."
And it worked.
And it gave the studio great relief.
"After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie."
"And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us, to say the movie was a go,"
I actually threw up.
(Laughter)
"You know, this is some tough stuff."
"So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this."
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
"And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem."
(Laughter)
So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
"Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money."
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
"So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down."
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so.
"And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen."
"And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions."
"He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up."
"Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things."
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
We did about 325 shots.
Yes.
Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?
Mozilla was in those days a technol..
"Sorry, the question was ""Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?"""
Mozilla in those days was seen as a technology development organisation.
And Netscape liked to think that it was building the browser.
[Question]
Did everyone hear Dan?
"The initial theory was like the Linux kernel, where Mozilla would be the technology development asset that builds the kernel and other organisation would build the commercial products from it."
So we had this ongoing tensions and one of them was Mozilla was becoming a product in its own right.
"It turned out that as the Netscape and AOL management began building their product to drive traffic to AOL, more people started using the Mozilla version than the Netscape version."
That was going on in the background and let to some of these tensions.
"So I was fired and the belief at Netscape at the time was that by getting rid of me,"
Netscape management would then have the ability to control the Mozilla open source project and could convert it into a set of people that helped Netscape build the product that they wanted.
"Essentially, to view the community as a free work force that would help build the Netscape product."
"Of course, the competing view is that we're all building an open source project that has to meet the needs of the community and that people who contribute and build the product have some say in what happens to it."
"What happened at that point was that the two groups of people, the small group of people that had been mozilla.org staff and the larger group of people which were all the engineers contributing to Mozilla reunited to form one shared outlook."
What happened was that essentially the engineers working at Netscape were very clear that the leadership that they were following was Mozilla.
And it was me.
And it was not their management.
"So, everyone involved voted to continue to try to build an open source project."
So I remained the General Manager of Mozilla.
"I remained the leader of the Mozilla project and the spokesperson for the development of the Mozilla project, much to the surprise of the Netscape and AOL management."
We learned a lot of lessons out of that.
We learned from that that leadership depends on who will follow you.
You need to lead people.
"My own view is that you have to be leading in the right direction enough of the time, that enough people follow or enough people also lead in that direction."

I was fired in 2001 and yes...
Yes.
Yeah.
"Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term ""Mersenne number"" to where ""n"" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below."
"Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if ""M"" is a Mersenne prime then ""M""(""M""+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (If it exist, it would have to be greater than 101500)."
"It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number."
"The binary representation of 2""n"" - 1 is ""n"" repetitions of the digit 1."
"For example, 2""5"" - 1 = 11111 in binary."
"The first four Mersenne primes were known by the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks and algorithms to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest known primes are also Mersenne primes."
"As of December 21, 2018, 51 Mersenne primes have been found. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, formula_1."
Super Monkey Ball
"Super Monkey Ball is a platform video game. It was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan in January 2001 as an arcade game titled ""Monkey Ball"". It had a joystick in the shape of a banana. It was later released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Titled ""Super Monkey Ball"", it was released in Japan on September 4, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, and in Europe on May 3, 2002."
Gameplay.
"""Super Monkey Ball"" has three modes of gameplay: Main game, party games and mini-games."
Main game.
"In the main game, the object is to guide a monkey in a hamster ball across a series of platforms in the air and through a goal at the end of the level. Four monkeys are available for the player to play as. Each level is timed; with a level running for either 30 or 60 seconds. The player controls the main game with the GameCube controller's control stick. By moving the stick, the whole level moves, and the ball rolls in the direction that the level moves. Each level has bananas that the player can collect. Bananas give the player points, and collecting a certain amount of them gives the player an extra life. Should the player fall off of the level or the timer reaches zero, the player loses a life. There are three main difficulties: Beginner, Advanced and Expert. Beginner is ten easy levels, Advanced is 30 non-easy levels, and Expert is 50 harder levels. Should the player meet a certain condition after completing a difficulty, they will be able to play the difficulty's ""extra"" levels. A fourth difficulty level, Master, can be unlocked by completing the Expert and Expert Extra levels without using a continue. Master is the hardest difficulty level, with ten levels."
Party games.
"There are three party games: Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey Fight. In Monkey Race, players race on one of several racing levels, competing for the best rank. In Monkey Target, players roll their monkey down a ramp and open the monkey's ball to fly in order to land on one of several islands. Three levels are available to play on. In Monkey Fight, players punch other monkeys for points. When time runs out, whichever monkey has the most points wins."
Mini-games.
"There are three minigames that can to be unlocked with points gotten in the main game: Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards and Monkey Golf. Each minigame is based on the real life sport."
Prudence Crandall
"Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 28, 1890) was an American teacher. She was born on September 3, 1803 to Quakers. She went to the New England Friends’ Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. In October 1831, she opened a private girls’ school in Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1833, an African American girl was admitted to the school. The parents of the white girls in the school wanted the black girl expelled. Crandall refused. She opened a school for African American girls in April 1833."
"The Connecticut legislature passed the ""Black Law"". This law made it illegal to open a school that taught African American pupils from a state other than Connecticut. Crandall was arrested, tried, and convicted of violating this law. She was put in jail. A higher court reversed the decision. Crandall was freed, but neighbors harassed her. They smashed the windows in the school. Crandall feared for the students’ safety. She closed the school in 1834."
"Crandall married Baptist minister and abolitionist Calvin Philleo. In 1835, the couple and his three children left Connecticut for Philleo’s farm in New York State. They later moved to Illinois. Here Crandall ran a school from her home. She also took part in women’s rights activities. When Philleo died in 1874, Prudence moved to Kansas to live with her brother. In 1886, the Connecticut legislature gave her a pension. Crandall died on January 28, 1890. She was buried in Kansas. Her old school house in Canterbury is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. In 1995, Crandall was named Connecticut's state heroine."

"His first film, in 2002, was ""Thamizh"", with Prashanth and Simran. Film critic Balaji commented that it was ""one of the few movies in recent times where a lot of importance seems to have been attached to the script. In spite of the flimsy story and routine screenplay where a youth grows to be a ""dada"", the dialogs elevate the quality of the movie and make it very enjoyable"". His second film ""Saamy"", under the Kavithaalaya banner, starred Vikram. It was named the year's biggest hit, grossing 160 million.

Zimmer's conjecture
"Zimmer's conjecture is a statement in mathematics ""which has to do with the circumstances under which geometric spaces exhibit certain kinds of symmetries."" It was named after the mathematician Robert Jeffrey Zimmer. The conjecture states that there can exist symmetries (specifically higher-rank lattices) in a higher dimension that cannot exist in lower dimensions."
"In 2017, the conjecture was proven by Aaron Brown and Sebastian Hurtado-Salazar of the University of Chicago and David Fisher of Indiana University."

People can break DRM. If someone breaks a DRM technology then copying is possible. All common DRM technologies have been broken. Making a DRM technology that can not be broken is very hard. Some people say that all DRM technologies can be broken. In the United States it is illegal to break a DRM.
DRM is a way for companies to keep their profits while sharing their content online. A good example of this is BBC iPlayer. They do this by keeping their content online for a certain amount of time.
Cement
"Cement is a material that hardens and sticks to other materials to hold them together. Portland cement is a common kind, and made from quicklime (heated limestone) and clay. Cement is used to make concrete and mortar."
Brown algae
"Brown algae are a large group of multicellular algae. All the brown algae are multicellular. Most brown algae have fucoxanthin, a chemical that gives them a brown color. They include many seaweeds in colder waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat."
"There are 2000 species of brown algae. Most species live in the ocean. They are important as food and as homes for many animals and marine life. Some brown algae are gathered by humans for food. The giant kelp ""Macrocystis"" is a brown alga that forms underwater forests, and it may grow to 60 meters. The Sargasso Sea gets its name from the ""Sargassum"" seaweed that floats on the surface. Many brown algae grow on rocks at the seashore."
Brown algae are unique among heterokonts in developing into multicellular forms with differentiated tissues. But they reproduce by means of flagellated spores and gametes that look like the cells of other heterokonts. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae).
Classification.
This is a list of the orders in the class Phaeophyceae:
Bacillus
"Bacillus is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer."
"Bacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are everywhere in nature. ""Bacillus"" includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species."
"Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods."
"Some species of ""Bacillus"" are worth noting:"
Milk powder
"Milk powder is a powder made by dehydrating milk. When water is added, it becomes liquid milk again. Milk powder is often used in countries that lack widespread access to refrigeration. As well, it is often used in recipes that call for milk."
Vaccinium vitis-idaea
"Vaccinium vitis-idaea (also called lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry) is a small evergreen shrub from the heather family that makes edible fruits."
Dehydration
"Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something. The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, ""hydor""."
"People get dehydrated when they lose more water than they take in. The human body needs water to survive. If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way. Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death."
What causes dehydration?
A living organism will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water. The most common causes of dehydration are:
Who gets dehydration?
"Any living being can get dehydrated. Some people are more at risk of dehydration. Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration."
Bristle
"A bristle is a stiff hair or feather. Also used are synthetic materials such as nylon in items such as brooms and sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning uses: common examples are the toothbrush and toilet brush. The bristle brush is a common household cleaning tool, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans."
Le Roy le veult
"""Le Roy le veult"" (""The King wills it"") or ""La Reyne le veult"" (""The Queen wills it"") is a Norman French line used in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to show that a public or private bill has received Royal Assent from the Monarch."
History.
"The practice of giving Royal Assent came from William the Conqueror to show that the King intended for something to be made law. Norman French came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used with it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327–1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422–61, 1470–71). Royal Assent was sometimes given in English, though more often in French. The practice of recording Parliamentary statutes in French or Latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since."
"During the period of the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to remove it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 ""for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice."" The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was later abolished in 1731, Parliament's practice was not affected."
Usage.
"The line is used to show that the Monarch has granted their Royal Assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor with the Lords Commissioners, has read out the Letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliament responds by saying the line 19 times towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House. The line is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the Monarch granted Royal Assent to the bill."
"The line has been used wrongly on other bills, same as the wrong line has also been used for government bills. There are a few occasions where this has happened, most notably on the Act of Supremacy 1558 where """"Soit fait comme il est désiré"", the line used for personal bills, was used instead of ""La Reyne le veult""."
"If the Royal Assent is refused, the line ""Le Roy / La Reyne s'avisera"""" would be used, though in practice no British monarch since Queen Anne has not given royal assent since a dispute over militia in Scotland in 1707."
George Herriman
"George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist. He is best known for his comic strip ""Krazy Kat"" (1913–1944)."

"Samuel James ""Sam"" Champion (born August 13, 1961) is the weather anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and weather editor of ABC News. Champion was born in Paducah, Kentucky. He has a B.A. in broadcast journalism from Eastern Kentucky University. He worked on ""Good Morning America"" as a weatherman, making reportedly $1.5 million per year. On April 7, 2012, he debuted as host of ""Sea Rescue"", an educational and informational television program that focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of animals back into the wild."
"Champion is active in many charitable organizations in the New York City area including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, March of Dimes, and ""Stopping AIDS Together"". He co-hosted the New York City Project's 2002 ""Courage Awards"". On 20 February 2013 ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported that a former Mets teammate of baseball player Mike Piazza's said in 2000 that Piazza and Champion were involved in a homosexual relationship. Piazza denied this in 2002. Champion and his longtime partner Rubem Robierb were married on December 21, 2012."

"Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (Breslau, 6 July 1818 – Breslau, 13 March 1879) was a German chess master, and a teacher of mathematics. He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 and 1870."
"Anderssen won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen lost matches in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.p16"
"Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60."
"He is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration."
His status.
"Anderssen was never world champion because ""there was as yet no concept of a formal championship, or of the means by which one might be awarded... The world championship proper was the creation of Wilhelm Steinitz (18361900)... The first match for the world championship was in 1886""... Also: ""Wilhelm Steinitz... was the first person to use the title of Champion of the world...""."
Mathematician.
"Anderssen was a teacher of mathematics in Breslau (now Wroclaw). He became a professor in about 1862, and in January 1865 was awarded honorary degrees of PhD and MA. These honours were not for chess, but not much is known about the teaching part of his career."
Bayesian network
"A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent random variables. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other."
"Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of (unassisted) machine learning. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval."
It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740s called Bayes' theorem.
History.
"The term ""Bayesian networks"" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:"
"In the late 1980s, the seminal texts ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems"" and ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems"" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study."
"Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913. Another variant, called path diagrams, was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models)."
"In 1974, the Wailers broke up because three of the band members wanted to pursue solo careers. Marley continued calling his band Bob Marley and the Wailers and joined together with new members to continue playing music. In 1975, Bob Marley had his first international hit called ""No Woman No Cry"". In Jamaica, he is considered a folk hero. Some other hits of his include ""Three Little Birds"", ""Africa Unite"", ""Buffalo Soldier"", and ""One Love"". His most popular studio album was called ""Legend"", which includes his greatest hits."
"Bob Marley died on 11 May 1981, at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami, Florida, of melanoma. He was one of the followers of Rastafarianism"

Erwin Rommel
"Field Marshal Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel, The ""Desert Fox"" (born : 15 November 1891 in Heidenheim Württemberg/died : 14 October 1944 in Herrlingen,Free People’s State of Wurttemberg) was an officer of the German Army in World War I and World War II. He died in 1944 at the age of 52 ."
"In WWII, he commanded the German Army in North Africa during the North African Campaign (1940-1943) in a long struggle against the British 8th Army. He was finally defeated at El Alamein. Later in the war, he commanded the German forces defending the French coast against the Allied Normandy invasion (1944)."
"Rommel was well liked by the German public and respected by the Allies. He was thought to be chivalrous and humane, when other German leaders were not. His famous ""Afrikakorps"" was not accused of any war crimes. Soldiers captured by his army were treated well and orders to kill captured Jewish soldiers and civilians were ignored."
"Rommel knew of the plan by senior officers to assassinate Hitler in 1944. When it failed, all concerned were tortured and executed. Hitler offered him the choice of suicide or court-martial, and he committed suicide. His death was announced as the death of a hero in battle."
Early life and career.
"Rommel was born in Heidenheim, Germany, 45 kilometers (28 mi) from Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg which was then part of the German Empire, on November 15, 1891. He was baptised on 17 November 1891. His father, Erwin Rommel (18601913) was a math teacher, and later a secondary school headmaster at Aalen. His mother was Helene von Lutz, the daughter of a local government official. Rommel was the second of four children; Karl, Gerhard, and Helene. Rommel wrote that his ""early years passed very happily."""
"At the age of 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider that was able to fly short distances. Young Erwin thought about being an engineer, and he showed a talent with technical work; however, because of his father, young Rommel joined the local 124th Württemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and, shortly after, was sent to the Officer Cadet School in Danzig. He graduated on 15 November 1911, and was a lieutenant in January 1912."
"While at Cadet School, early in 1911, Erwin Rommel had met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia Maria Mollin (also called ""Lucie"") (b. 6 June 1894 in Danzig; d. 26 September 1971 in Stuttgart). They married on November 27, 1916, in Danzig, and on December 24, 1928 had a son, Manfred, who would later become the mayor of Stuttgart. Manfred died in 2013. After having met Lucie, some historians think that Rommel also had an affair with a woman called Walburga Stemmer in 1913, and they had a daughter named Gertrud."
World War I.
"In World War I, Rommel fought in France, as well as in Romania and Italy, first as a member of the 6th Württemberg Infantry Regiment, and then in the Württemberg Mountain Battalion of the ""Alpenkorps."" While serving with that unit, he gained a reputation for making quick tactical decisions and taking advantage of enemy confusion. He was wounded three times and awarded the Iron Cross; First and Second Class."
"Rommel also received Prussia's highest medal, the Pour le Mérite after fighting in the mountains of west Slovenia, in Battles of the Isonzo–Soca front. The award came as a result of the Battle of Longarone, and the capture of Mount Matajur, Slovenia, and its defenders, numbering 150 Italian officers, 9,000 men, and 81 pieces of artillery. His battalion used gas during the battles of the Isonzo and also played a key role in the victory of the Central Powers over the Italian army at the Battle of Caporetto. While fighting at Isonzo, Rommel was taken prisoner by the Italians. He escaped, and because he spoke Italian, he was back to the German lines within two weeks. Later, when the German and Italian armies were allied during the Second World War, Rommel realised that their lack of success in battle was due to poor leadership and equipment, which when fixed, easily made them equal to German forces."
World War II.
Poland 1939.
"Rommel was a commander of the ""Führerbegleithauptquartier"" (Führer escort headquarters) during the Poland campaign, often moving up close to the front in the ""Führersonderzug"" train, seeing much of Hitler. After the Polish defeat, Rommel returned to Berlin to organize the Führer's victory parade, taking part himself as a member of Hitler's entourage. During the Polish campaign, Rommel was asked to help one of his wife's relatives, a Polish priest who had been arrested. When Rommel asked the Gestapo for information, the Gestapo found no information about the man's existence."

Saving Private Ryan
"Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American war movie directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat. Set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, the movie is known for its graphic portrayal of war and for the intensity of its second scene of 24 minutes, a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy landings. The movie follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of a family of four, with his three other brothers having been killed in action."
"In 1996, producer Mark Gordon pitched Rodat's idea, which was inspired by the Niland brothers, to Paramount, which eventually began development on the project. Spielberg, who at the time was forming DreamWorks, came on board to direct the project, and Hanks joined the cast. After the cast went through training supervised by Marine veteran Dale Dye, the movie's photography started in June 1997 and lasted two months. The movie's D-Day scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland and used members of the Irish Army as infantry for the D-Day landing."
"Released on July 24, 1998, ""Saving Private Ryan"" received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances (particularly from Hanks), realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's direction, and was placed on many movie critics' 1998 top ten lists. It was also a box office success, becoming the highest-grossing movie of 1998 in the United States with $216.8 million domestically and the second-highest-grossing movie of 1998 worldwide with $481.8 million worldwide. Additionally, it grossed $44 million from its release on home video in May 1999. The movie won several accolades, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Golden Globes, Producers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, and Critics' Choice Awards. The movie was nominated for eleven Academy Awards at the 71st Academy Awards, where it won five: Best Director (Spielberg's second), Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though it lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to ""Shakespeare in Love"" in a controversial Oscars upset."
"Since its release, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has been considered one of the greatest war movies of all time and has been lauded as influential on the war movie genre. It is credited for renewing interest in World War II media. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked ""Saving Private Ryan"" as the 71st-greatest American movie in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and in 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress."

Abortion laws
"Abortion laws specify under what circumstances a woman can get an abortion. Getting an abortion means that the pregnancy is ended early, without the birth of a child. These laws vary widely, by country, and sometimes by area. They have also changed over time."
"As of 2022, about 60% of the people live in a country that allows abortion, under some circumstances. When abortion is legal, it may mean that only part of the reasons are recognized, or that it is only legal for part of the pregnany."
Options for regulation.
"Generally, there are the following options, from the most liberal, to the most restrictive, when a pregancy can be ended:"
Common reasons for allowing an abortion:
Discussions about abortion.
"Abortion is a controversial subject in many societies: People argue in favor or arganist it, using argumrnts from religion, moral and ethical values, or practical or political reasons. Note that legally outlawing abortions will not stop people from getting an abortion: They may get an unsafe abortion, which is riskier than a legal abortion. A study done in 2007 found that abortion rates were similar in countries where abortion was legal, and those countries where it wasn't. Very often, people get an abortion, because they do not have easy access to modern contraceptives. According to the same study, the number of abortions is decreasing, because contraceptives are more commonly available."
Timeline.
"The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of July 2022, 65 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request."
"Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included (e.g., leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States). Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved."
Johann Adolf Hasse
"Johann Adolf Hasse (also spelled Johann Adolph Hasse; baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was a German composer, singer, and music teacher. He was an important opera composer in the 18th century."
Life.
Early career.
"Hasse was born in Bergedorf, near Hamburg. His father and grandfather were organists. He studied in Hamburg from 1714 to 1717. In 1718 he joined the Hamburg State Opera. He was a tenor singer. In 1719, he started working in Brunswick. He performed operas written by Georg Schürmann, Francesco Conti and Antonio Caldara. His own opera, ""Antioco"", was performed in Brunswick in 1721. It is his only opera which is written in the German language."
"He might have left Germany in 1722. He went to Naples. In Naples, he converted (changed his religion) to Catholicism. He studied writing music and counterpoint with Alessandro Scarlatti. Hasse's first opera in Italy was ""Il Sesotrate"". It was performed on 13 May 1726. The opera was a success. It made him a famous composer and musician."
Dresden and Venice.
"In 1730 Hasse visited Venice. He married Faustina Bordoni, an opera singer. His opera ""Artaserse"" was performed there. It was his first opera which uses Metastasio's text. The opera was a success."
"He became the ""Kapellmeister"" of the Dresden court in around 1730. He arrived at Dresden in 1731. His employer was King August II of Poland. He wrote operas and church music in Dresden. In Dresden, he wrote the opera ""Cleofide"". The opera uses text by Metastasio. Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach may have watched the opera's first performance. On the next day, Bach performed on the organ. Hasse might have watched Bach play the organ. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach said that his father and Hasse were good friends."
"As part of his job, Hasse did not have to stay in Dresden. From 1733 to 1734 he stayed in Italy. He wrote music for the Ospedale degli Incurabili, an orphanage in Venice. He also went to Vienna. He taught Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria how to sing. Hasse came back to Dresden in December 1733. He wrote new operas. He also wrote some church music. In 1734, the king of Poland went to Warsaw. Hasse went back to Italy. He stayed in Italy until 1737."
"He went back to Dresden in 1740. He wrote the operas ""Antigono"" and ""Ipermestra"". The text for these operas were written by Metastasio. Hasse and Metastasio became good friends. They wrote many operas together."
"Wine making begins with growing red or white grapes. Wine grapes have thicker skins and bigger seeds compared to table grapes for eating. After the grapes are ripe, they are picked off the plants. There are different ways of picking (for example, using machines, or picking by hand, in the day, or at night)."
"After harvest, the grapes are crushed to release their juice, which is very sugary. Before, this was done by people stomping on grapes with their bare feet. Today, machines are used, but people sometimes use their bare feet in festivals. The person making the wine also decides now if the wine will be red, white, or rose:"
"Next, the sweet grape juice is fermented, by adding yeast. In a few days, the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol, and also releases carbon dioxide."
"After fermenting, the wine is stored for a while (called ""aging""). The person making the wine can make different choices, which will change the flavor of the wine. They can choose to store the wine in a steel container, or a barrel made of oak wood. If they choose wood, the wine will absorb some of the wood flavor, which wine drinkers call ""oakiness"". This process can take only a couple of weeks, up to several years, depending on what kind of flavor the wine maker wants."
"Lastly, the wine is bottled and sent to a customer, restaurant or store to be enjoyed."
Wine and people.
People have been making wine for about 5000 years.
Wine is a popular drink in many countries. The countries that drink the most wine (using numbers from the year 2000) are:
"However, if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine, the list is different:"
"Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay, and Slovenia."
Wine is made in many countries. The countries that make the most wine (using 2015 numbers) are:
"Italy, France, Spain, USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, South Africa, China and Germany."
Width
"Width or breadth is the side-to-side length, measuring across the object at right angles to the height."
"For example, the distance between the left side and right side of a chair is its width."
Water
"Water () is a transparent, tasteless, odourless, and almost colourless chemical substance and covers over 70% of Earth's surface. No known life can live without it."
"Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very cold (below ), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very hot (above ), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor. It is moved around in the water cycle. Water is essential for life."
Physical chemistry of water.
"Water is a fluid. Water is the only chemical substance on Earth that exists naturally in three states. There are over 40 anomalies (strange things) about water. Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water freezes, it expands by about 9%. This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes."
Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O.
"Like other liquids, water has a surface tension, so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface."
"Things having something to do with water may have ""hydro"" or ""aqua"" in their name, such as hydropower or aquarium, from the Greek and Latin names for water. It is also called the ""universal solvent"", because it dissolves many other compounds."
"In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color."
Uses of water.
"Plants and animals (including people) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place, and is the main part of blood. It keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin. Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive. Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body. Saliva, which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make urine. Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water, but this value differs with age; i.e. a foetus is 95% water inside."
"Water is the main component of drinks like milk, juice, and wine. Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients, things like sugar, fruit, and sometimes alcohol. Water that a person can drink is called ""potable water"" (or ""drinking water""). The water in oceans is salt water, but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water."
"Many places, including cities and deserts, don't have as much water as people want. They build aqueducts to bring water there."
"Though people can survive a few months without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few desert animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink."
"Water has no smell, taste, or color."
"It is often reported as a number of deaths per 1000 individuals per year. For example, a mortality rate of 9 in a population of 1,000 would mean 9 deaths per year in that entire population."
Ricotta
"Ricotta is an Italian fresh whey cheese made from the whey of sheep's milk or cow's milk. Whey is a watery liquid that separates from curds when cheese is made. Ricotta is soft, grainy and white. It can be used in Italian desserts like cheesecake or cannoli or in dishes like lasagna. It contains protein and is a dairy product."
Whey
"Whey is a watery liquid that comes out of milk when it has been curdled and strained. It is also called milk plasma. It is a by-product of cheese making. ""Sweet whey"" is made during the making of rennet types of hard cheese like Cheddar or Swiss. ""Acid whey"" (also known as ""sour whey"") is made during the making of acid types of cheese such as cottage cheese. Whey also forms as a liquid on the top of yoghurt."
Uses.
"Whey can be used to make whey cheeses like ricotta. It can be added to processed foods like bread, pastry or crackers. It can also be used to feed animals."
Curd
"Curds are a dairy product made by ""curdling"" milk with rennet or yeast so that it separates, and taking away the liquid part (called whey). Milk that has been left to go sour will also naturally separate into curds and whey. Curds are used to make cheese. Curds and whey can be eaten together as a dish."
Pokhara
"Pokhara is the second largest city of Nepal. It is the main tourism centre of Nepal. It is 200 km away from the capital, Kathmandu."
&lt;br&gt;
Seal of Colorado
"The Seal of the State of Colorado is an adaptation of the ""Territorial Seal"" which was adopted by the ""First Territorial Assembly"" on November 6, 1861. The only changes made in the Territorial Seal design being the changing of the words, ""State of Colorado"" and the figures ""1876"" for the corresponding words on the territorial seal. The first ""General Assembly"" of the State of Colorado approved the adoption of the state seal on March 15, 1877. The ""Colorado Secretary of State"" alone is authorized to affix the Great Seal of Colorado to any document whatsoever."
Flag of Maine
"The Flag of the State of Maine has the state coat of arms on a blue field. In the center of the shield a moose rests under a tall pine tree. A farmer and seaman represent the normal reliance on agriculture and the sea by the state. The ""North Star"" represents the state motto: Dirigo (""I Lead"")."
Seal of Maine
"The Seal of the State of Maine was adopted in June 1820. There have been different kinds in the details of the seal, but the overall design and images remain true to the first. The center of the seal is a shield with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods, pine tree stand tall directly behind the moose. On either side of the shield, a farmer rests on his scythe, and a sailor leans on an anchor. Above the shield is the motto ""Dirigo"" (I lead), and a North Star. Below the shield is a banner that reads ""Maine"". The legislature of 1919 thought that the design of the seal should no longer vary, and the design is still used today."
Doctorate
"A doctorate is a degree earned by passing a doctoral dissertation. Usually, it refers to a Ph.D., but it can also be an Doctor of Medicine or an Juris Doctor. Colleges often give honorary doctorates to famous people who speak there."
Cluster (computing)
"In computing, a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand. Clusters can have different forms: They can be whole computers working together, or only CPUs. These CPUs can communicate over a fast network, but they share the same hard disks, for example. Depending on the problem, solving it with a cluster of cheaper components can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more."
Grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem. They are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are.
"In 1904, Lorentz showed that electrical and magnetic fields can be modified into each other through the Lorentz transformations."
"In 1905, Einstein published his article introducing special relativity, ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"", in ""Annalen der Physik"". In this article, he presented the postulates of relativity, derived the Lorentz transformations from them, and (unaware of Lorentz's 1904 article) also showed how the Lorentz Transformations affect electric and magnetic fields."
"Later in 1905, Einstein published another article presenting ""E"" = ""mc""2."
"In 1908, Max Planck endorsed Einstein's theory and named it ""relativity"". In that same year, Hermann Minkowski gave a famous speech on ""Space and Time"" in which he showed that relativity is self-consistent and further developed the theory. These events forced the physics community to take relativity seriously. Relativity came to be more and more accepted after that."
"In 1912, Einstein and Lorentz were nominated for the Nobel prize in physics due to their pioneering work on relativity. Unfortunately, relativity was so controversial then, and remained controversial for such a long time that a Nobel prize was never awarded for it."

Lilly Pulitzer
"Lillian Pulitzer Rousseau (Lillian Lee McKim; November 10, 1931 – April 7, 2013), better known as Lilly Pulitzer, was an American fashion designer and socialite. She is known for founding Lilly Pulitzer, Inc., which makes clothes with bright, colorful patterns. Because the brand has been very popular with rich people, Lilly has been called the ""Queen of Prep""."
Personal life.
"In October 1945, she married Fritz Hartnagel (1917–2001). Fritz had been Sophie’s fiance, and after the execution Fritz and Elisabeth had been brought together from their shared grief at their loss. Together the couple had four children. After the death of her sister Inge Aicher-Scholl in 1998, Elisabeth began to speak about her siblings at schools and other educational institutions. She was commited to keeping the memory of her brother and sister alive. She died on February 28, 2020, one day after her hundredth birthday."
Fritz Hartnagel
"Friedrich ""Fritz"" Hartnagel (born February 4, 1917 in Ulm; died April 29, 2001 in Stuttgart) was a lawyer and soldier of the Wehrmacht during World War II. In the 1950s, Hartnagel, then a judge in Stuttgart, campaigned against the rearmament of the Federal Republic. He was Sophie Scholl's (unofficial) fiancée."
Early Life and Relationship with Sophie Scholl.
When Hitler first came to power Hartnagel was entranced by him and his vision for Germany. He volunteered for an officer career in the spring of 1936 after an early Abitur and was a professional officer of the Wehrmacht until the end of World War II.
"In 1937, Hartnagel met Sophie Scholl at a dance event. Under Scholl's influence and after experiences on the front (including in the Battle of Stalingrad), Hartnagel changed from an enthusiastic soldier to an opponent of war and Nazi dictatorship. He supported the resistance activities with news about the course of the war and war crimes and with amounts of money (including 1000 Reichsmarks) although he never officially joined any reistance movements."
"After the execution of Hans and Sophie on the 22nd February 1943 Hartnagel assisted the Scholl family. After the remaining Scholl family members were put into Sippenhaft (clan arrest), Hartnagel appealed for clemency for the Scholl family. After they were released, he supported them financially."
After the War.
"On April 14, 1945, Hartnagel was captured by US troops and kept as a prisoner of war until September 1945. In October 1945, he married Sophie's sister Elisabeth Scholl, who he had grown close to after Sophie's execution."
"In 1946, Hartnagel began law studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich (the same college Sophie Scholl had gone to.) He completed his studies and became a judge. He died on April 29, 2001, at the age of 84."
Atlanta Compromise
"The Atlanta Compromise was an informal agreement, between the black people of the cotton-producing states of the United States, and the government of these states. It came after a speech by Booker T. Washington, given in 1895. The compromise is the following: The black people would tolerate means of racial segregation, most notably the Jim Crow laws. In exchange the white government of these states would allow them to get some basic education for free; this education was focused on technical jobs or basic training in jobs the industry needed. This would also improve the living conditions of the black peaople. Black people would no longer focus on fighting for egality, integration into society or justice. White people would finance educational institutions for black people, such as Tuskegee University. Even though people agreed on these points, their agreement was never written down."
"Shortly afterwards, arounf 1900, African-American leaders, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter, said that black people should instead focus on the stuggle for civil rights. It was Du Bois who coined the term to Atlanta Compromiise to refer to the speech by Brooker T. Washington."

African plate
"The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as the oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes the African Plate and the smaller plates to its right, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole."
"Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift."
One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards.
The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean).
"Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate."
"The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great southern supercontinent Gondwana, as was the Indian subcontinent."
OpenStep
"OpenStep was an operating system by NeXT. It is an x86 version of the NeXTStep operating system, which was also by NeXT."
Rhapsody (operating system)
"Rhapsody was the name given to Apple Computer's next-generation operating system. Apple got the Rhapsody operating system when they bought NeXT Inc. from Steve Jobs for $425 million. The same year Apple released Rhapsody to software developers so they could create versions of their software for the next release of the Apple operating system. But a key software vendor, Adobe Systems, did not like Apple's plan for the new OS. Without Adobe supporting them Apple decided not to go ahead with Rhapsody. Rhapsody was replaced by OS X, scheduled for 1999."

Arabian bustard
"The Arabian bustard (""Ardeotis arabs"") is a bird native to North Africa and the Middle East. It lives in the Sahel region (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan), South Sudan, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen."
"As in all bustards, the male Arabian bustard is much larger than the female. Males have been found to weigh , while females weigh . The record-sized male Arabian bustard weighed . These birds stand from tall in females to tall in males."
National Bohemian
"National Bohemian Beer is an American beer first made in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it ""Natty Boh"" as a nickname."
History.
"In 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn’t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian."
Relationship with Baltimore.
"Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles’ wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called ""the beer of Maryland""."
Mr. Boh.
"In 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh."
Service animal
"""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", also sung as ""Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?"", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"" was part of the 1932 musical ""New Americana;"" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era."
Summary.
"The song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines."
Musical structure.
"The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word ""time"" in the line ""Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,"" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly """"Brother,"" can you spare a dime?"" is replaced with the aggressive """"Buddy,"" can you spare a dime?"""
Update.
"During the bad times in the 1970s, the ""New York Times"" asked Harburg to update ""Brother"" for a new age, and he responded with:"
Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz
SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz is an Austrian football club from Vorarlbergs capital Bregenz.
History.
"The club was founded in 1919 under the name FC Bregenz. The club colours were black and white. Till 1927 they only played friendly matches versus teams from Germany and Switzerland. In 1927 they played for the first time in Vorarlbergs league. Already 1928 they became Vorarlbergs champion. 1938, after the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany they formed with other teams from the region the Bezirksklasse Bodensee-Vorarlberg. Due to the Second World War the league was dissolved in 1942."
"After the War FC Bregenz was refounded under the name SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz. They reached the highest level of Austrian football, the Staatsliga,for the first time in 1954 but was relegated the same season. Till 1999 the club played under different names in the second level of Austrians league. 1999 they were promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga, where they played till the 2004/05 season. At this time they were relegated to the Erste Liga, the second level. Due to financial problems they could not get the licence and the club declare bankruptcy. For the young players a new club was founded, SC Bregenz. Although it is legally a new club the supporters saw it as replacement of the old club. Since 2007 this club plays in the Regionalliga West (3rd level)."
River Shannon
"The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland. It runs mainly in a north/south direction, dividing Ireland geographically between east and west. It is thought to rise in Shannon Pot in County Cavan, and enters the sea in the Shannon Estuary at Limerick. The river represents a major physical barrier between east and west."

"Moulins, Allier"
"Moulins is a ""commune"" in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in central France."
"It is the ""préfecture"" (capital) of the department and the historical capital of the old province of ""Bourbonnais"" (the Duchy of Bourbonnais)."
History.
"Moulins experienced its golden age in the 15th century, when the Dukes of Bourbon lived in the city on the Allier river. The region of the northern Massif Central where is Moulins is called the ""Bourbonnais"" after the House of Bourbon."
Moulins became the capital of Allier on 4 March 1790 with the creation of the departments in France.
Reception.
"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" was praised for having more realistic graphics and story."
Secure Digital card
"A Secure Digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is ""chipped off"". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way."
There are different kinds of cards:
"SD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system. Some devices (for example the Wii) that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update."
"There are also different ""classes"". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are ""Class 2"" - which means 2 MBytes/second, ""Class 4"" - 4 MB/sec and ""Class 6"" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions."
"Still another measurement is called ""rating"". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x."
microSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller.

Dje
"Dje (Ђ, ђ), also known as Djerv, is the sixth letter of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, used in the Serbian language to represent the sound for need to tell , a palatalisation, similar to the English sound of letter ""j"" . It was created on model Cyrillic letter ћ by Vuk Karadžić."
Serbian Cyrillic alphabet
"The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet (, ""srpska/Vukova ćirilica"", literally ""Serbian/Vuk's Cyrillic alphabet"") is the official and traditional alphabet used to write the Serbian language."
The alphabet.
"The following table gives the upper and lower letters forms of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, along with the Serbian Latin equivalent and the IPA value for each letter:"
Rhinoceros (genus)
"The genus Rhinoceros of the family Rhinocerotidae includes the one-horned rhinoceroses, of which there are two extant species: the Indian rhinoceros (""R. unicornis"") and the Javan rhinoceros (""R. sondaicus""). These are characterized by one horn (actually thickly matted hair) on the upper snout."
Sumatran rhinoceros
"The Sumatran Rhinoceros (""Dicerorhinus sumatrensis"") is a member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It is the smallest rhinoceros, standing about 120–145 centimetres (3.9–4.8 ft) high at the shoulder, with a body length of 250 centimetres (98 in) and weight of 500–800 kilograms (1100–1760 lb)."
"The Sumatran rhinoceros is a small, hairy rhinoceros which survives in limited numbers in pockets of Indonesian and Malaysian rain forests. Only three institutions showcase Sumatran rhinos, the Cincinnati Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Borneo."
Cell biology.
"The cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis. Two things happen during meiosis, each of which makes the offspring more variable. That means they are different from the parents and from each other."
Assortment.
"Assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete. Of each pair of chromosomes, ""which one goes into a single gamete is random"". Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same, this means that there is genetic variation between gametes. This process was Mendel's 'first law', the law of segregation."
Crossing over.
"Because crossing over occurs during meiosis, this increases the variety of the chromosomes. This makes recombination possible."
The consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical. Identical twins are the exception. They are identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg.
Advantages and disadvantages.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction, compared to asexual reproduction. The main issues are:"
Origin of sexual reproduction.
The origin of sexual reproduction is an advanced topic which cannot be dealt with here. A source which may help readers who are graduates in biological science may be helpful.
Leprosy
"Leprosy is a contagious disease. It has been known for a very long time. Today, it is mostly called Hansen's disease, named after the person who discovered the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen. It is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. A person with leprosy is called a leper."
"As of 2004, the estimated number of new infections was about 400,000."
"Getting the disease is hard, since it requires close contact with someone who has it, over a long period of time. In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it."
"Most cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries. It has known to have been in the US before. There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world. This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria."
"In former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed."
Symptoms.
"The symptoms of leprosy are irregular spots and patches on the skin. These are either lighter colored than the surrounding skin, or reddish in color. On those patches, hair will fall out, and they will feel numb to the patient. Nerves will form knots there."
"With the illness progressing the sense of touch will become less and less (until the patient feels completely numb). So called leptomes and ulcers will eat away the skin, the flesh and the organs on the patches."
"Usually people do not die of leprosy, but of secondary infections and diseases they get."
For many years there was a leprosy colony on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai called Kalaupapa. Tens of thousands of people from the United States that had the disease were sent there.
Dolley Madison
"Dolley Payne Todd Madison (May 20, 1768 – July 12, 1849) was the wife of US President James Madison. James Madison was president from 1809 to 1817 while Dolley Madison was the First Lady of the United States. She is best known for saving Washington's portrait when the British burned the White House in the War of 1814. Though she is also a famous entertainer, the first to serve ice cream in the White House."
"Dolley was born in New Garden. Now the place is known as Guilford County. It is in North Carolina. Some other account tells that she was born in a village named Payne’s Tavern. It is in Person County, North Carolina."
"Her father’s name was John Payne. As an unsuccessful farmer, he always faced shortage of money. Dolley’s mother was Mary Coles."
"Dolley spent her teenage years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 7, 1790, she married John Todd, Jr. (1764-1793). Todd was a lawyer. They had two sons. Their names were John Payne (1792-1852) and William Temple (born and died in 1793). William died in a yellow fever epidemic. In the same year, her husband also died of the same yellow fever epidemic."
"Dolley Todd married James Madison on September 14, 1794. They had no children, but they raised Dolley's son from her first marriage, John Payne Todd. John Payne Todd was a notorious drunkard and gambler, which caused his mother many financial problems, especially after Madison died."
"In 1814, the British army had burnt the White House. Fleeing from her burning home, Dolley saved many records and papers. Legend states she also saved a painting of George Washington, though had to break it out of its frame."
"On the National First Lady Library she says, ""There is one secret, and that is the power we have in forming our own destinies."""
"He was born on 9 January 1834 at Courtfield, Ross, Herefordshire, England, second son of the fourteen children. Five of his brothers also became priests. Herbert, the eldest, became a cardinal and archbishop of Westminster, and John, the youngest, auxiliary bishop of Salford. Another brother, Reginald, married Julia Shanahan, sister-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings. Four of his five sisters became nuns."
"Because of his health he was educated at home in a religious atmosphere. In 1850 he was sent to St Gregory's College at Downside near Bath. His mother's death in 1853 made him think of a religious life and on 12 September he joined the Benedictines, becoming Brother Bede. In 1855 at his father's request and expense, he was sent to Rome for further study under the guidance of the Italian scholar and reformer, Angelo Zelli-Jacuzzi. He was ordained priest by Cardinal Patrizi in the basilica of St John Lateran on 9 April 1859."
Neighborhood of Make-Believe
"The Neighborhood of Make-Believe is the fictional kingdom where hand puppet lived in. They were characters on the children's television series ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" which aired on PBS, from 1968–2001. Principal puppeteer Fred Rogers created many of the puppet characters in the 1950s for Josie Carey's program, ""The Children's Corner"". It was filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
Characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were portrayed by both hand puppets operated by puppeteers and actors. They would occasionally talk to the viewers in specific episodes.
There is a TV show about the Neighborhood called Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

Allen Dulles
"Allen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). He was its longest-serving director so far."
"Dulles was head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War. He oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, Operation Ajax, the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission."
"Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer. His older brother, John Foster Dulles, was the Secretary of State during the Eisenhower Administration."
Exosome complex
"The exosome complex is a protein complex which can degrade RNA strands (~stop them working). In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus."
"The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the 'RNase PH-like proteins'."
"Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea. In bacteria a simpler complex called the ""degradosome"" carries out similar functions."
Royal National Lifeboat Institution
"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is an agency which rescues people at sea in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, as well as on some large rivers."
"The RNLI is a charity. Two-thirds of its funding comes from money left in people's wills. Most of its crew members are volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and 444 lifeboats. These are boats that travel from the shore to rescue people at sea, rather than lifeboats that are used for escaping from a ship. Their crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. The RNLI also provides beach lifeguards and flood rescue teams."
"The RNLI cannot be called for help directly. In the event that someone is in danger at sea, the coastguard of the country or territory should be called on 999 or 112. The coastguard organize the search for those in danger. They will then call the RNLI if their help is needed. Not all lifeboats in the UK and Ireland are run by the RNLI; there are some independent lifeboat agencies."
Puppeteer
"A puppeteer is a person who makes an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal, legendary creature, or another object to create the illusion that the puppet is ""alive"". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs."

University of London
"The University of London is a federal university made up of 31 affiliates: 19 separate university institutions, and 12 research institutes."
"Its headquarters, Senate House, is in Malet Street in the Bloomsbury area of Camden. This is near University College London and the British Museum."
"The University of London is the largest university in the UK by number of full-time students, with 135,090 campus-based students and over 45,000 in the University of London International Programmes."
"The constituent colleges are responsible for the teaching, the research or the individual students and staff of the constituent colleges; the university is not. The university is an administrative body responsible for standards, degree examinations and certification."
"The university was first established by a Royal Charter in 1836, which brought together in federation ""London University"" (now University College London) and ""King's College"" (now King's College London)."
"Graduates of the University of London may use the post-nominal letters 'Lond.' or 'Londin.' (both from ""Londiniensis"") after their degree abbreviations."
"The university's biggest colleges are Birkbeck, Goldsmiths, King's College London, the London Business School, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, SOAS, LSE and UCL."
History.
"Founded in 1836, the University at first comprised just two colleges. They were University College London (founded in 1826), which did not apply religious tests to its students, and King's College (founded in 1829), which admitted only members of the Church of England. Therefore, both University College and King's pre-date the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for the constituent colleges."
"In 1858 the University expanded its role by offering the University of London International Programmes to candidates outside the colleges, the first of its kind in the country. A new headquarters at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role."
"In 1878 the University became the first university in the UK to admit women on equal terms with men. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country."
Friedrich III of Germany
"Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl von Hohenzollern (New Palace, Potsdam ; 18 October 1831 - New Palace, Potsdam ; 15 June 1888) was the only son of Wilhelm I."
"After his father's death on 9 March 1888 Friedrich Wilhelm became King of Prussia and German Emperor as Friedrich III, but he was already suffering from throat cancer and died after just 99 days on the throne."
"On 25 January 1858 he married Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, eldest child of Queen Victoria and Albert the Prince Consort. They had seven children. The oldest, Friedrich Wilhelm, followed him as King and Emperor."
"Friedrich Wilhelm III died of throat cancer in Potsdam. He is buried next to his wife in the Mausoleum of the Friedenskirche in Sanssouci Park, Potsdam."
King's College London
"King's College London (King's or KCL) is a large university in London, and a college of the federal University of London."
"University College London (1826) was founded before it. However, King's (1829) was the third oldest university in England to get its royal charter."
"In 1836 King's became, with University College, one of the two founding colleges of the University of London."
"King's is arranged into nine Schools of Study, spread across four Thames-side campuses in central London and one in Denmark Hill, South London."
"King's is one of the largest centres for graduate and post-graduate medical teaching and biomedical research in Europe. It is home to six Medical Research Council centres, the most of any British university."
"King's has around 18,600 full-time students and 5,030 staff and had a total income of £508 million in 2009/10, of which £144 million was from research grants and contracts."
"There are 12 Nobel Prize winners amongst King's alumni and former faculty. King's is ranked 5th nationally and 19th in the world in the 2015 ""QS World University Rankings,"" 7th nationally and 27th in the world in the 2015 ""The Times Higher Education World University Rankings ""and 7th nationally and 55th in the world in the 2015"" ""Academic Ranking of World Universities. In September 2010, ""The Sunday Times"" selected King's as its ""University of the Year""."
King's is a member of the European University Association and the Russell Group. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities.
Ganggangsullae
"Ganggangsullae (Hangul: 강강술래) is a 5,000-year-old traditional Korean dance. It was first used to bring a good harvest and has become a cultural symbol for Korea. The females in Jeollanam-do usually dance this the most. Chuseok, the Korean style holiday a bit like the American Thanksgiving, is often known as the special day for this dance."

Bride kidnapping
"Bride kidnapping is when a man abducts the woman he wants to marry. The practice is also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture,"
"Bride kidnapping (which is often shortened to bridenapping) has been practiced around the world, throughout history. Peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe have done it."
Bride kidnapping still occurs in different parts of the world. It is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
"Most countries see bride kidnapping as a sex crime, and not as a valid form of marriage. In some cases, it is seen somewhere beteen a forced marriage and an arranged one."
"In many cases, the woman will cooperate with the kidnapper, to save her face, or to save the honour of her family or her parents."
"Many countries also have laws that say that this is not a crime, if the woman later marries the man. Very often, there are also customs, which see bride kidnapping as some form of tradition."
"In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime because of the implied element of rape, rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws. Even in countries where the practice is against the law, if judicial enforcement is weak, customary law (""traditional practices"") may prevail."
"Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, wealth paid by the groom and his family to the bride's parents, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it."
"Bride kidnapping is when one man (or a man and his friends) abduct one woman. When this is done on a larger scale (a large group of men abducting many women), this is known as raptio, and different from bride kidnapping. In the 21st century, there have been more cases of war rape, which may have elements of bride kidnapping. Women and girls abducted by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors."
"In some countries, there are still rituals, which involve a symbolic bride kidnapping as part of a wedding. Some say that the honeymoon is a relic of such a practice: the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month."

Guilt (law)
"In criminal law, a person is guilty if a court has decided they have done something illegal. If a person has broken a law by stealing, for example, they are guilty of a crime."
A person is guilty if a court says they are. The court has blamed them for doing something wrong. A guilty person is punished. The punishment is called the sentence.
Length
"Length is a measurement. A ruler can measure length. The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing. Short means a small length. Long means much length. Short and long are opposites. For two dimensional things, length is usually the longer side."
Length of Time.
Length also describes time.
Time Example.
"John sits down at one o'clock, or 1h. John waits until three o'clock, or 3h. John stands up at three o'clock, or 3h. John was sitting for 2 hours. The length of time John was sitting was two hours."
Weight
"The weight of an object (or the weight of an amount of matter) is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field. Weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass. For small objects on Earth, the weight force is directed towards the center of the planet. For larger objects, such as the Moon orbiting around the Earth, the force is directed towards the center of mass of the combined system."
"In common language, the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the Earth's surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history, weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing and to use kilograms and pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing."
Units of weight.
"The unit of weight in the International System of Units is the newton, which is represented by the symbol 'N'."
"Other units have been in use in the past but have been abandoned, such as the dyne (the unit of force in the old CGS system) or the kilogram-force, which is the force exerted on a"
kilogram of matter by a 'standard' Earth: a body with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.81 N at sea level.
Measuring weight.
"The weight of an object, or of an amount of matter, is typically measured with an instrument such as a spring scale. The scale includes a spring which provides a force to oppose the gravitational force on the object which is being weighed. The gravitational force pulls down, the spring pushes or pulls upwards. Typically, the scale has a readout which gives not the weight (which is a force) but rather the mass of the object. Spring scales are made with the assumption that they are being used on the surface of the Earth. If a spring scale was taken to the Moon it would give a misleading reading."
A balance style weighing scale is a device that compares the weights of two object in the same gravitational field: it determines whether one object is heavier or lighter than the other.
Weight is variable.
Weight is not an intrinsic property of matter because the local gravitational field that generates the force called weight is variable in space and time:
Truth
The truth is what is true. It may be everything that is true (reality) or just a part of it (a fact). It may also be a statement that is true: a truth. Things or statements that are not true are untrue or false. True things exist (or have existed); false things do not (or never have).
"Aristotle said: ""To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."" However, a statement may be about how things once were; this would be a true statement if it is clear that it is not a statement about how things are now. Most often, the tense of the verb will indicate this, but there may be other ways in which the statement is qualified: for example, by saying when the statement was true."
"Truth is a noun, and the corresponding adjective is true. The word ""true"" also functions as a noun, a verb and an adverb. The English word ""truth"" is from Old English ""tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ"", Middle English ""trewþe""."
Most of the discussion on truth is about one of two things:
Many philosophers have given opinions on these issues.
In Other words.
Besides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions. He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon.
Meyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe. This is why some people hated him.
Meyerbeer’s reputation after his death.
"Meyerbeer’s operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century, but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion. From 1933 to 1945 his music was banned in Germany by the Nazis because he was Jewish. Today there is some interest again, but nothing like the huge popularity he had in his lifetime."
Grand opera
"Grand Opera is a term which is used to describe an opera with continuous music. It is a kind of opera that was popular in the 19th-century. Grand operas are usually divided into four or five acts. There have large casts (many singers taking part) and large orchestras. There is a lot of scenery. The story is dramatic. It is usually a story about a hero from history. The term ""Grand Opera"" has often been used to describe the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850, and sometimes to describe the Paris Opéra itself."
"In a broader sense ""Grand Opera"" can be any large-scale opera from European countries. During the 1830s and 1840s Giacomo Meyerbeer was thought to be the greatest composer of Grand Opera."
Lake Lucerne
"Lake Lucerne is a lake in central Switzerland. It is the fourth largest lake in the country. The German name is Vierwaldstättersee which means: ""Lake of the Four Forested Cantons""."
It is possible to travel all the way round the side of the lake by road. There are several tunnels on the way. It is very popular with tourists. There are many hotels by the lake.
Die Feen
"Die Feen (""The Fairies"") is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. The German libretto was written by the composer. He was adapting a story by Carlo Gozzi called ""La donna serpente""."
"""Die Feen"" was the first opera that Wagner finished. However, it was never performed during his lifetime. It has never become popular, although the overture is sometimes played. The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time. It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas. The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories. The idea of being saved (redemption) is also an important idea that he used in later operas."
Rienzi
"Rienzi is an opera by Richard Wagner. Its full title is Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen (""Rienzi, the Last of the Tribunes""). It is one of the earliest operas Wagner wrote. There are five acts. Wagner wrote the libretto himself, using the story from a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It was composed between 1838 and 1840 It was first performed at the Hofoper, Dresden on 20 October 1842. It was the first time Wagner had a success as an opera composer."
Story.
"The story of the opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzi (1313–1354), a medieval Italian populist figure who manages to trick the nobles and their followers. He helps the people to get power. At first he is very popular, but then he has to use force against the nobles, and the Church turns against him. In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering."
Chess tournament
A chess tournament is a competition between chess players. It can take one of these forms:
"Since the first international chess tournament in London, 1851, chess tournaments have become the standard form of chess competition among serious players. Currently, FIDE holds candidates tournaments every two years to determine challenger to the world champion."
"In 1851, Adolf Anderssen became first unofficial champion. In 1858, Paul Morphy beat him and became second unofficial champion. In 1871, Johannez Zukertort defeated Adolf Anderssen to become third unofficial chess champion. There are three unofficial world chess champions: Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Johannes Zukertort, stemming from first strong international tournament in London in 1851, won by Anderssen."
The Flying Dutchman
"Der fliegende Holländer (""The Flying Dutchman"") is an opera by Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote the libretto himself. The story comes from the legend of the ""Flying Dutchman"", which is about the captain of a ship. It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea, without ever going on to land, until Judgment Day."
"The most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love. It was a favourite idea of Wagner, who used it a lot in his later operas."
"Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843. It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style. It is very different from the previous opera ""Rienzi"" which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing. In ""Der fliegende Holländer"" the drama is very important. Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture. We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with."
"Wagner originally wrote ""Der fliegende Holländer"" to be performed without any breaks (intermission). Sometimes it is performed like that today, but Wagner also made a version with three acts."

The China Syndrome
"The China Syndrome is a disaster movie about a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant. It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term ""China syndrome"" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth ""all the way to China""."
Plot summary.
"News reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team."
Response of the nuclear power industry.
"Upon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as ""sheer fiction"" and a ""character assassination of an entire industry"". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels."
Flag of Aruba
"Aruba's national flag () was adopted on March 18, 1976. The flag has a field of light blue (called ""Larkspur""), two narrow parallel horizontal yellow (""Bunting Yellow"") stripes in the bottom half, and a four-pointed white-fimbriated red (""Union Flag red"") star in the canton."

"The national flag of Curaçao is a blue field with a horizontal yellow stripe slightly below the midline and two white, five-pointed stars in the canton."
Gusinje
"Gusinje (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Гусиње, ), is a small town and municipality in north-eastern Montenegro. In 2011, it has a population of 4,027 people. The town is located in a very thin valley and it is surrounded by mountains. This is due to its location in the Plav-Gusinje valley. The majority of the population are Muslim and profess Islam. It has a mixed population of Muslim Bosniaks and Muslim Albanians. Both of these ethnicities however, live in peace and coexist with eachother."
Name.
"The name ""Gusinje"" (Гусиње) is derived from ""guska"" (goose). Its older name was ""Gousino"" (Гоусино). In the Ottoman period, it was known as Turkish ""Gusna"" (گوسن). In Albanian, it is known as ""Gucia""."

The end of the first third of the year for southern hemisphere DST countries occurs at 11:00 p.m."
Andes
The Andes are a mountain range along the western coast of South America.
"They stretch over 7,000 km / 4,400 miles from the south of Argentina and Chile to the north of Colombia. They are also found in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador."
The Amazon river system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes.
"The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world, and the second-highest after the Himalayas. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia."
"Aconcagua, the highest peak, rises to 6,962 m (22,841 ft) above sea level. The top of Mount Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center. Mount Chimborazo is an inactive volcano in Ecuador, which last erupted over a thousand years ago."
Geography.
The Andes has three sections:
"The northern part has two parallel ranges. They are the ""Cordillera Occidental"" (western) and the ""Cordillera Oriental"" (eastern). The term ""cordillera"" comes from the Spanish word meaning 'rope'."
"In Colombia, north to the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, western, central and eastern."
"In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Snowy Mountain Range of Saint Martha) is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,700 metres above sea level just 42 km from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range."
The western range of the eastern Cordillia Oriental is the only one which reaches Colombia .
"The Andes range is about wide throughout its length, except in Bolivia where it is wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, which lie in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela, represent the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range."
Geology.
The Andes are a Mesozoic–Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
"The Andes are the result of plate tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the South American continental plate. South America, like North America, has been moving west since the Cretaceous period. Thus the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate formed the Andes. This was caused by the westward movement of South America."
"The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic and Jurassic when Pangea begun to break up and several rifts developed. It was during the Cretaceous period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rock of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and weathering."
Climate.
"The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area, the altitude, and how close it is to the sea. The southern section is rainy and cool. The central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm, with an average temperature of in Colombia. The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The snow line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800–15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, going up to 4,800–5,200 m (15,800–17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then going down to on Aconcagua at 32°S, at 40°S, at 50°S, and only in Tierra del Fuego at 55°S; from 50°S, many of the bigger glaciers go down to sea level."
The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes.
Plants.
"Rainforests used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now reduced, especially in the Chocó and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. Farming, deforestation, illegal crops, and population growth has done this."
"A direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. That area, and many Interandean Valles, normally have deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric (dry) vegetation, up to the mostly lifeless Atacama Desert."
"About 30,000 species of vascular plants live in the Andes. About half of those are endemic to the region: it is a hotspot. The small tree ""Cinchona pubescens"" is a source of quinine used to treat malaria. It is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that came from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes."
Isaac Newton was the first person to solve to the general two-body problem.
Three or more bodies.
"Looking at the generalizations, there are two other problems which are related:"
Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution was proposed in Congress on December 9, 1803. It was ratified by the state legislatures on June 15, 1804. It provided new procedures for electing the President and Vice President. Before the amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast a single vote. The candidate who received the largest number of votes became the President. The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes became the Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment changed the process to the current system whereby one vote is cast for the President and one for the Vice President."
Background.
"The Constitutional Convention of 1787 went over several different proposals for electing the President. Some wanted Congress to choose the President. Other suggestions included selection by the state legislatures, by the state governors or by a congressional committee. Near the end of the convention the question was turned over to a committee called the Committee of Eleven for leftover business. They devised a system called the Electoral College. The plan was accepted and was added to the Constitution."
"In 1789 the Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first president. He was reelected in 1792. In both cases he was the only president to receive all of the electoral votes. In the 1796 election, Washington declined to run. His Vice President, John Adams, and his running mate Thomas Pinckney ran for President and Vice President respectively. Alexander Hamilton tried to use his influence to get Pinckney more votes, making Adams the Vice President again. But the scheme backfired when Thomas Jefferson got more votes than Pinckney, but Adams won more of the electoral votes. This made Adams the President and Jefferson the Vice President."
"The 1800 Presidential election showed the deep problems in the electoral college system. Jefferson ran against Adams again. Both had running mates. Pinckney was again the running mate of Adams for the Federalist Party. Aaron Burr was Jefferson's running mate for the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes creating a tie between two candidates from the same political party. Under the Constitution, the matter was to be decided by the House of Representatives. In the House, the two tied again in 35 votes. Only on the 36th ballot was the deadlock broken and Jefferson was elected president."
"The solution to the problem became the Twelfth Amendment. It was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803. Three days later it was submitted to the states for ratification. Fourteen of the seventeen states (at the time) ratified it and the amendment was added to the Constitution on September 25, 1804."
Provisions.
"The Electoral College remained much the same under the Twelfth Amendment. But the process for choosing a president and vice president changed. Under the Twelfth Amendment an elector must cast separate votes for the President and Vice President. If nobody gets the majority of the votes, the process remains the same as before; the House of Representatives decides."
South by Southwest
"South by Southwest (SXSW) is a set of festivals and conferences. They are about movies, interactive media, and music. It takes place every year in March in Austin, Texas, United States. It began in 1987. It has continued to grow in both scope and size every year."
"South by Southwest is run by the company SXSW, Inc."

Past movies that premiered at SXSW include ""Furious 7"", ""Neighbors"", ""Chef"", ""21 Jump Street"", ""The Cabin in the Woods"", ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Insidious"", and the TV series ""Girls"", ""Silicon Valley"" and ""Penny Dreadful""."
"Although the film festival often shows independently produced movies, studios have often shown their comedies there before they are released. They do this to get an idea of how popular the movie will be in theaters."
SXSW Interactive.
"SXSW Interactive is about new technology. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator. According to a festival organizer Louis Black, SXSW Interactive ""has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world"" since 2007."
Hurricane Ida (2009)
"Hurricane Ida was the last storm in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days. After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua. Over Central America, Hurricane Ida weakened very fast, becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5."
"By November 6, Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again. Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama. Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused $5.6 million in damage and caused 2 deaths."
Storm history.
"Ida was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1. A low soon formed near the tropical wave. This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it. There was hardly any wind shear, which allowed for more clouds to form."
"On November 4, the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven. The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that. An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour, which meant it was nearly a hurricane."
"Continuing to the northwest, Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour; at the time, it was put at only 75 miles per hour. Soon after this, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5. Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall. Near the end of the day on November 5, Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression."
"Tropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6. Over the western Caribbean, it quickly became a tropical storm again. After moving north, Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again. &lt;ref name=""update11/7/09""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico; they were measured at 105 miles per hour, making it a category 2 hurricane. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength. so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm."
"For only six hours, it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama. At the time, it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama, this was later noted as incorrect. Its remnants formed a strong nor'easter that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States."
Impact.
"Damage in Nicaragua was near $2.1 million and there were no people killed. In El Salvador, it seemed at first that killed over 100 people, this was discovered as a mistake later on."

"""Los Navegantes"" has a perimeter of approximately . It was founded between 1996-1997. It has a court. The Pichilemu tsunami secure side, starts near the neighborhood."
The Rugby Championship
"The Rugby Championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport's four strongest Southern Hemisphere nations—New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Argentina. It began in 1996, a year after the sport became professional, as the Tri Nations. At the time, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa competed for the Tri Nations Trophy. Beginning in 2012, Argentina joined the competition."
"During the Tri Nations era, the contest began in July, during the Southern Hemisphere winter, and ran through September. For most of that era, each team played every other team twice, once at home and once away. Later on, each team played the others three times. When the competition added Argentina, it returned to a pure home-and-away format, with a total of 12 games played. Also, due to a slight change in the sport's calendar, The Rugby Championship now begins in August and runs through October. This format is used except in years in which the Rugby World Cup is played (every four years, in the year before the Summer Olympics). In those years, each team plays the others only once, with a total of six games played."
"Teams are awarded competition points for a win, but can also earn 'bonus' points. At the end of the series, the team with the most competition points wins the trophy. The team that wins the competition is usually considered to be the best rugby union team in the Southern Hemisphere for that year."
Additional trophies.
New Zealand and Australia compete annually for the Bledisloe Cup. All Rugby Championship games count as competition games for the Bledisloe Cup.
South Africa and Australia compete annually for the Mandela Plate. Some of the Rugby Championship games count as competition games for the Mandela Plate.
Black Forest cake
"The Black Forest cake, also called ""Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte"", is an authentic German cake made up of a chocolate layer cake with cherries in the middle and whipped cream on top. They are traditionally made with fresh Morello cherries, poached in a sugar syrup and pitted. It is a variation of the chocolate cake, and sometimes decorated with chocolate curls."
Jeremy Clarkson
"Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English author, broadcaster, journalist, talk show host. He is best known for presenting BBC television show ""Top Gear"" with Richard Hammond and James May. He is also known for controversial remarks."
He also writes columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun.
Clarkson was ranked 49th on Motor Trend Magazine's Power List for 2011. It is a list of the fifty most important figures in the automotive industry.
"On 26 March 2015, while Clarkson was not allowed to be at work, the BBC announced it will not keep paying him after he said cruel things to and attacked a producer."
Syd Ward
Sydney William Ward (5 August 1907 – 31 December 2010) was an Australian-born New Zealand cricketer.
"Ward was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the second longest-lived cricketer, behind England's Jim Hutchinson, who at the time of his death was 103 years and 344 days old."
Hypothermia
"Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than . Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink."
Mild.
"When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop. The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands. They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well."
"Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest."
Moderate (Middle).
"The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking unsteadily. The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere."
Severe.
"Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies."
Rapids
"Rapids are found on rivers. Rapids are formed by one or more of the following: constriction, obstruction, gradient, and flow rate. For instance, when water is flowing swiftly over a rocky river bed, rapids can be formed. Rapids are typically found in or near the mountains, due to the element of gradient. Formally, the word ""rapids"" is always plural, (like ""scissors"" and ""trousers""), but is often used in the singular when speaking of a specific rapid or when it would be grammatically awkward; e.g., ""Sweet's Falls Rapids vs. Sweet's Falls Rapid). The word ""rapid"" means ""very fast."""
"Because of the splash made by the water going over rocks, rapids are also called ""whitewater"". Some people enjoying whitewater canoeing or whitewater rafting as a sport."
Waray language
"Wáray-Wáray or Warai (commonly spelled as ""Waray""; also ""Winaray"" or ""Lineyte-Samarnon"") is a language spoken in the provinces of Samar, Leyte, and Biliran in the Philippines."
"The Waraynon group of languages consists of Waray, Waray Sorsogon and Masbate Sorsogon. All the Warayan languages belong to the Visayan language family and are related to Cebuano and more closely to Hiligaynon and Masbatenyo."
Usage.
"Waray-Waray is one of the ten officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines and used in the local government. It is spoken throughout the islands especially in the Eastern Visayas region. But it is also spoken in some parts of Mindanao, Masbate, Sorsogon and Metro Manila where Warays went to. There is also a very small number of Filipinos abroad, especially in the United States, that speaks this language."
43 × 0 = 0
0 ÷ 43 = 0
43 ÷ 0 has an undefined answer.
0 ÷ 0 has no answer.
"The following table includes all of the above examples along with other operations in a condensed, generalized form (where ""x"" represents any number)."
History of zero.
"The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon, India and in Central America at different times. Some places and countries did not know about zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics. For example, the year after 1 BC is AD 1 (there is no year zero). In India, zero was theorized in the seventh century by the mathematician Brahmagupta."
"Over hundreds of years, the idea of zero was passed from country to country, from India and Babylon to other places, like Greece, Persia and the Arab world. The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs, and stopped using Roman math. This is why numbers are called ""Arabic numerals""."
The place of zero as a number.
"Zero is almost never used as a place number (ordinal number). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages."
Some other things about zero:
"Any number divided by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:"
"0 ÷ 0 = ""not a number."""
"In time, zero means ""now"". For example, when a person is counting down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off, the count is: ""three, two, one, zero (or ""go"")"". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky."
0 as a number.
Definition.
"0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1, and follows −1. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means ""courageous one"" in hieroglyphics."
"Zero is a number which means an amount of null size; that is, if the number of brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before one counts the first item, and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result."
Debates.
Is zero a number ?
"While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others."
Is zero a natural number ?
A debate asking if 0 is or not a natural number has been discussed over time.
Encyclopædia Britannica says 0 is a natural number. Wolfram MathWorld´says it isn't. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences says it isn't. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics says 0 is a natural number.
"Although the International Baccalaureate thinks 0 to be a natural number. Oxford Dictionary says ""a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3, and sometimes also zero""."
As year.
"There was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More specifically, almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero."
0 as a numeral.
"The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x."
"On the seven-segment displays of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models, it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common."
"The ""number"" zero (as in the ""zero brothers"" example above) is not the same as the ""numeral"" or ""digit"" zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes."
The numerical digit zero.
"Xiphactinus (from Latin and Greek for ""sword-ray"") was a large, 4.5 to 5 m (15 to 20 feet) long predatory bony fish that lived in the Western Interior Sea, over what is now the middle of North America, during the Late Cretaceous. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia in the United States, as well as Europe and Australia."
Description.
"Above all else, ""Xiphactinus"" was a great swimmer, able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time. It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin. It was not however immune from attack. If injured, its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for sharks, Mosasaurs, and other Xiphactinus."
Emperor Kenzō
"was the 23rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Kenzō to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Kenzō""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
Kenzō was a grandson of Emperor Richū; and he was adopted as heir by the childless Emperor Seinei.
Events of Kenzō's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Kenzō's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kenzō.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, Kenzō final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Kofun
are earthen tombs or tumuli in Japan. They were constructed between the early 3rd century and early 7th century.
These burial mounds are referenced in the name of the Kofun period (middle 3rd century - early-middle 6th century).
Many of the kofun have a keyhole-shaped mound () which is unique to ancient Japan.
Chess and computers
"Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea,p87 and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science."
"There are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways."
Chess engines.
"Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner."
"Competitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage."
Fritz.
"Fritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called ""Deep Fritz"" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that ""Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before""."
Shredder.
"Shredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard."
Rybka.
"Rybka, a product by Vasik Rajlich, is Shredder's main rival. Rybka 4 is their latest version."

Venky has night blindness and Varun stutters, however, Venky hides his disability from everyone. Venky, along with his friend, loses a lot of their money after investing in Harika's family restaurant. In a search for money, Varun mistakes Honey (Harika's sister) for a rich woman and plans to marry her. Venky agrees to fund Varun's plan, failing to recognize Honey due to his night blindness."
"Venky and Varun take a huge amount of loan from Pala Baby by pledging their property. After spending lakhs of rupees by giving expensive gifts and cash to Honey, they realize their mistake while Harika's family lose all their money in shares. Pala Baby, who worships women, drops his plans to waive off the loan after realizing the guile methods of Harika's family. They all reach the police station to settle their issue. However, CI Nagaraju, an honest policeman who is on the brink of losing his job, hatches a plan to raid his commissioner's house with them to steal the illegally acquired cash and diamonds. They successfully execute their plan and hide the valuables in the boot of a scrap car. While doing so, they also rescue a kidnapped girl."
"The following morning, they confess their robbery to the commissioner out of fear. However, the car goes missing and the commissioner threatens their life if they fail to return the stolen amount. When Venky, Varun, Harika and Nagaraju are about to commit suicide, they receive news that billionaire Anand Sharma was looking for his prodigal son."
"They all reach his place in Vizianagaram. Venky, Varun, Harika (in a male disguise), and a junior artist hired by Nagaraju present themselves as Anand's son. Unsure of who the right person is, Anand lets everyone stay in his palace. They scheme against each other and utterly fail to impress Anand. All the contenders endure the toughest of the tests given by Anand. As a final effort, Anand announces that whoever brings his F3 toy factory to profits shall be declared as his heir."
"Putting their differences aside, all the contenders team up together to create a new kind of toy in order to achieve profit. They develop a set of interactive toys by merchandising popular Telugu film characters, namely, Baahubali, Gabbar Singh, Ajay Krishna, Veera Raghava, Chitti Babu and . The sales skyrocket and the factory earns a bumper profit. They together elect Varun and present him to Anand as his rightful heir. Anand, however, reveals that his son died by suicide several years ago after earning money by fraudulent means. Since they have rescued his granddaughter, Anand gave them an opportunity to prove themselves and offers them the profit they earned. Venky, Varun and others realize their mistakes and give up the money."
"Later, Anand is kidnapped by his subordidates who demand a ransom of crore. Venky, Varun and others arrive at the place but they are attacked by the goons. Initially, they try to confuse them but when the plan fails, Venky dresses up as Narappa while Varun as Vakeel Saab and thrash the goons together.

Mexico
"Mexico (; official name: United Mexican States , ) is a country in North America. Mexico is south of Texas, California and other American states. Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico."
"People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak Spanish. There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages, like Nahuatl, Mayan, and Zapotec. Most modern Mexicans are descended from Native Americans such as Aztecs and Mayans and mostly have native blood. They are Catholic. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City."
History.
"Before the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the Olmec culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatán peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II."
"In 1519 the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain."
"In 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide. He set up the First Mexican Empire and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic."
"A man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio López de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a dictator, Texas declared independence (1836). The Battle of the Alamo was part of this Texas Revolution. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the southwestern United States. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela."
"Between 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Juárez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After more war he was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again."
"Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio Díaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Díaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910."
"The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down."
"In 1929 President Plutarco Elías Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president Lázaro Cárdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940."
"After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas."
"Mainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years."
Politics.
Mexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Parliament has a Senate and House of Deputies.
Geography.
"Mexico is in the southern part of North America. It is roughly shaped like a triangle. Mexico is more than 3000 km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East. Mexico has two large peninsulas. Baja California in the northwest, and Yucatán in the southeast. In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocatépetl and the Iztaccíhuatl. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are deserts. In the south are tropical rainforests. Some rivers in Mexico are the Río Bravo (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the Río Balsas, the Río Pánuco, and the Río Yaqui."
People.
"Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is also the second most populous country in Latin America (after Brazil). 60% of Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers (mostly Native American); these are called mestizos. Almost 30% of Mexicans are pure Native American and 10% are European. Most Mexicans (90%) speak Spanish. 10% of the Mexicans speak a Native American language, like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Maya or Zapotec. Non-indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico speak another foreign language such as Arabic or Japanese. Most people in Mexico are Catholic (89%) Christians."
Atlantic Ocean
The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean. It covers a total area of about . It covers about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology.
Geologic history.
"The Atlantic formed when the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Africa. This began sometime in the Cretaceous period, roughly 135 million years ago. It was part of the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea."

"Yi I (December 26, 1536–1584) was a Korean Confucian scholar. His mother was a famous calligraphist, Shin Saimdang. He was very intelligent as a child, learning to read at three and being very bright at his studies. He was also devoted to his parents: when his mother was sick, he prayed to his ancestors to heal her; and when his father was sick, he cut his own finger with a knife and let his father drink his blood (at that time, people thought human blood was very good medicine)."
Sunrise (company)
"Sunrise is a Japanese animation company. The staff uses the name Hajime Yatate in all their productions by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but this is not a real person--it is a name that all the people who work for the studio use for themselves."

X-ray
"X-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are waves of X-radiation. X-rays have a shorter wavelength, and therefore more energy, than ultraviolet radiation. They have a much shorter wavelength than visible light (the light that we can see). Radiation with shorter wavelengths (more energy) than the X-ray is called Gamma radiation (γ-rays). These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
The wavelength of X-rays covers a wide range. Most X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. This corresponds with frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV.
"X-rays can go through many solid materials. For this reason, taking photograms with X-rays is used in medicine in order to see bones and other things inside the body. Sometimes the term ""X-Ray"" means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them."
"What these images show will depend on three things: Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering and photoabsorption. The images show bone because it is dense enough that X-rays are not able to pass through it. Instead, the X-rays are either absorbed or scattered. The images do not show skin and muscle, however, because these tissues are transparent enough for the X-rays to pass through them without being absorbed too much. To detect tumors, other imaging devices are used; such as magnetic resonance imaging. A computed tomography scanner combines an X-ray machine and computer to construct a three dimensional (3D) picture. This has some ability to see other things besides bone."
"X-rays are made by hitting metal with fast-moving electrons. They are photons, tiny packets of energy that can move atoms and change chemicals in the body. They are ionizing radiation but the things they do depend on the wavelength of the X-rays (or how much energy they have). X-rays with smaller energies (""soft"" x-rays) cause the photoelectric effect. Mid-level energies cause Compton scattering. High-level energies (""hard"" X-rays) cause pair production. X-rays used for making pictures of people have low to medium energy. Radiation therapy that treats cancer uses Compton scattering and sometimes Pair production."
"There are small amounts of X-rays in the air. Like other energy in the air, X-rays can change living cells. Exposing the human body to high doses of X-rays for a long time is dangerous. It can cause cancer. However, cancer cells are hurt more easily, so X-rays are sometimes used to kill them."
Computed tomography scanner
A computed tomography (CT) scanner is an X-ray machine that takes cross section images. They can help a doctor in diagnosis.
Hanoi
"Hanoi () is the capital of Vietnam. It is also the second most populated city in the country. In 2004, about 3,083,800 people lived in the city. It has been the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) since 1945 and the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (all of Vietnam) since 1976. Before that, it was the capital of the country now called Vietnam for most of the time from at least the 11th century until 1802. The city is on the right of the Red River, and the city's name translates to English as ""inside the river"". Things made there include machine tools, plywood, textiles, chemicals and handicrafts. Hanoi is at 21°2' North, 105°51' East, 1,760 km north of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Popular tourist sites in the city include Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, Hoa Lo Prison, and the Palace of Literature. Nearby Hanoi is also where pho, Vietnamese beef noodle soup, was first created."

Grosvenor Bridge
"Grosvenor Bridge, also called Victoria Railway Bridge, is a railway bridge over the River Thames in London, between Vauxhall Bridge and Chelsea Bridge."
"It is made up of two bridges that were both built in the mid-19th century. The eastern side was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858-60 to carry trains into Victoria Station. This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The western side was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1865/66."
"Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 1963–67, the original piers now being wrapped in concrete. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox &amp; Partners."
"On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west. The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west."
Vauxhall Bridge
Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank.
History.
Vauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.
"The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane."
The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.
"In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames."
Ambrose Burnside
"Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824 – September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, railroad executive and politician. He served as governor of Rhode Island (1866-1869) and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War, he fought successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee but was defeated in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. Burnside commanded the IX Corps, the Department of Ohio, and also the Army of the Potomac for a few months. His distinctive style of facial hair is now known as sideburns, derived from his last name."
List of crossings of the River Thames
"This is a list of crossings of the River Thames including bridges, tunnels and ferries. There are almost 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six public ferries and one ford. The list starts at the downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the start of the river."
"A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed."
"Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so."

Super Mario 128
"Super Mario 128 refers to a series of development projects that were originally to be used only to create a sequel to ""Super Mario 64"". As debuted at Nintendo's Space World trade show in 2000, the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts were gradually incorporated into various games across many years. This includes the rapid object generation in ""Pikmin"", the ""sphere walking"" technology used in """" and ""Super Mario Galaxy"", and the physics of ""Metroid Prime""."
History.
"""Super Mario 64"" sequel."
"The name ""Super Mario 128"" was first used as early as January 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto, as a possible name for a ""Super Mario 64"" sequel. This rumored expansion and sequel to ""Super Mario 64"" called ""Super Mario 64-2"" was said to be developed for the 64DD, but ended up being cancelled due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3's 1997 convention that he was ""just getting started"" on the project."
"In November 1999, Shigeru Miyamoto said, ""Well, for over a year now at my desk, a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor. We've been thinking about the game, and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system."" The game had only a demo of one level made for it. Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include."
Autonomic dysreflexia
"Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency."
Who Gets Autonomic Dysreflexia?
"AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button)."
AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Symptoms.
Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include:
What Causes Autonomic Dysreflexia?
Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly.
"Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response."

Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award
"In Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year Award is given each year to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The award was start in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA. They selected a winner every year from 1940 through 1946. The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' first baseman, won the first award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League. At first, the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987, 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line."
"Of the 128 players named Rookie of the Year, 14 have been selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Jackie Robinson, five American League players, and eight others from the National League. The award has been shared twice: once by Butch Metzger and Pat Zachry of the National League in 1976; and once by John Castino and Alfredo Griffin of the American League in 1979. Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any team (with 16). This is twice the total of the New York Yankees (eight), who have won the most in the American League. Fred Lynn and Ichiro Suzuki are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same year. Fernando Valenzuela is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award in the same year. Sam Jethroe is the oldest player to have won the award, at age 32, 33 days older than 2000 winner Kazuhiro Sasaki (also 32). Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants and Neftali Feliz of the Texas Rangers are the 2010 winners."
Qualifications and voting.
"From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter had their own rules for decide who was a rookie. In 1957, the BBWAA first defined the term as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any Major League season before the current season. This guideline was later changed to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the last year. The current rule is 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (except for time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was first used in 1971. Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place choice is given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most total points. Edinson Volquez received three second-place votes in 2008 even though he was not a rookie under the award's definition."
"Some baseball writers have criticized the voting in recent years because several players who played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) have won the award. These winners include Hideo Nomo in 1995, Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000, and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The current definition of rookie for the award is based only on Major League playing. Some writers feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional playing. This issue came up in 2003 when Hideki Matsui lost the AL award to Ángel Berroa in a close vote. Jim Souhan of the ""Minneapolis Star Tribune"" said he did not think Matsui was a rookie in 2003 because ""it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience didn't count."" ""The Japan Times"" had a story in 2007 on calling Daisuke Matsuzaka, Kei Igawa, and Hideki Okajima as rookies, saying ""[t]hese guys aren't rookies."" Past winners such as Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe, and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the Negro Leagues."

Demonic (album)
"Joint resolution 39 was passed by the House of Representatives in 1911 proposing a constitutional amendment to directly elect US Senators. The Senate accepted the resolution but since it included a change, it went back to the House. The amended Joint resolution was sent to the states for ratification a year later. The required three-quarters of the states ratified the amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment became official on April 8, 1913."
Clauses.
Clause 1.
"The people of the United States are to elect two Senators from each state, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote in the Senate. There are 100 Senators and 100 votes. ""The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures"" means that anyone who can vote in a state election in their state, may also vote for a Senator. In the archaic language of the Constitution this was written in such a way to allow for states having different qualifications for persons eligible to vote for their Senator."
Clause 2.
"The clause. Previously, when vacancies occurred, several state legislatures were not able to agree on who would fill the position. Before the Seventeenth Amendment, vacancies could last for months and even years in some cases. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held."
Clause 3.
"This is a simple addition to prevent the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment from interrupting the election or term of any Senator chosen before the amendment was passed. The United States Senate elections, 1914 were the first nationwide popular elections for Senators."

Flint water crisis
"The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan which began in April 2014. When the city changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water to the Flint River, it created a serious public health danger."
"In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. They may experience serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has killed 10 people in the county."
"On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency for Flint. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency. He authorized additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security almost two weeks later."
Legionnaires' disease
"Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia caused by any type of ""Legionella"" bacteria. Over 90% of cases are caused by ""Legionella pneumophila""."
"The length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is generally two to ten days. It can be as much as 20 days. People with Legionnaires' usually have fever, chills, and a cough. Some also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting."

Icosane
"Icosane, also commonly spelled eicosane, is an alkane or a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula H20C42. It has 366,319 structural isomers. Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, ""n""-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature."
Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.
Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
"The compound is found in the highest concentrations in plants such as Mexican ageratum, licorice, and the Bayrum tree."

Fight or flight response
"The fight-or-flight response (or acute stress response) is a set of physiological changes that occur when an animal is threatened. The changes include increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure."
This response was first described by W.B Cannon. He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing. This response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.

British Armed Forces
"The British Armed Forces are the armed forces of the United Kingdom. The British Armed Forces are officially called Her Majesty's Armed Forces, and they are sometimes called the Armed Forces of the Crown. The British Armed Forces is made up of three parts: the British Army, the Royal Navy (and the Royal Marines) and the Royal Air Force."
"The Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces is the British monarch. Members of the British Armed Forces must swear that they will obey the orders of the monarch (swear allegiance). Under the constitution of the United Kingdom, the armed forces controlled by the Crown, however, because of the 1689 Bill of Rights, the UK cannot have an army during peacetime unless the British Parliament allows it. Nowadays, the British Parliament passes an Armed Forces Act every five years, which means the UK can keep its military. The British Prime Minister is the ""de facto"" commander of the British Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=""United Kingdom 05/06""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence."
"The British Armed Forces protect the United Kingdom, the British overseas territories and the Crown dependencies. They also take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The British Armed Forces often take part in NATO missions. The most recent wars the British Armed Forces have fought are the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Operation Palliser, peacekeeping in the Balkans and Cyprus, and defending the no-fly zone over Libya. The British Armed Forces have bases in the following places: Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Qatar and the Sovereign Base Areas (Cyprus)."

Christina Onassis
"Christina Onassis (December 11, 1950 – November 19, 1988) was a Greek-Argentine businesswoman and socialite. She was the heiress to the Onassis family fortune. She was the only daughter of Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman, and Athina Livanos."
"Onassis was born at LeRoy Sanitarium in New York City, United States, but she gave up her American citizenship. She had a brother, Alexander Onassis. Her daughter, by Thierry Roussel, is Athina Onassis Roussel (named after Christina's mother). Christina died in Buenos Aires from a heart attack. She was aged 37. Her heart attack was caused by pulmonary edema."
Athina Onassis
"Athina Onassis Roussel (alternate: Athina Onassis de Miranda; born 28 January 1985) is a French-Greek heiress. Her grandfather was Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman. She is his only living descendant. Her mother was Christina Onassis. Athina inherited her grandfather's fortune when her mother died in 1988."

Arrogance
"Arrogance (also called hubris) indicates strong pride or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with reality and overestimating one's own competence or capability."
It is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines.
Arrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. Children raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves.
"Arrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded culture. Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work."
Arrogance is different from confidence. Arrogance may be associated with insecurity. Confidence has an association with improving and examining one's own weaknesses.
"Hubris is the ancient Greek concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as ""pride"". Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris."

Wage
A wage is money that is paid by an employer to an employee in exchange for work. The amount may be fixed for each task completed (this is called piece rate); or it may be based on time or other measurable quantity of work done.
"Work for wages is the most common form of work. Because of this, the term ""wage"" sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment. However, a wage is different to a salary or commission. A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive ""tips"" paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as annual leave and sick leave."
"Wages are usually paid by the hour. This is called an hourly wage. Wages paid by the day are still common. Wage rates may be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), laws, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan. In many countries, laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers. This means that employers cannot pay workers a lower rate than the minimum wage; however, they can pay them a higher rate. The minimum wage rate is there to protect the working class."
"Wages were paid in the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome."

COVID-19 pandemic
"The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of September 4, 2022, more than 600 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in almost every country on Earth. More than six million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 580 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease."
"The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining."
"The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic."
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
"In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people."
"25 other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed."
"The United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 1,000,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country."

"In 1991 Jayalalithaa became Tamil Nadu's youngest chief minister. Despite a monthly salary of Rs.1, she made a grand marriage for her foster son Sudhakaran, lavishly spending. In the 1996 election, the AIADMK was nearly wiped out . Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new DMK government filed several corruption cases against her, and she spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the 1998 general election, as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam became a key component of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that her withdrawal of support thrown the BJP government without majority and further triggered to another general election just in a year in 1999.The AIADMK returned to power in 2001, although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases.

Vodka
"Vodka is a Russian alcoholic drink that is usually about 40% alcohol. It is clear (but can be flavoured), though it is sometimes mixed with other liquids before people drink it. It was first popular in the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe and former republics of the Soviet Union."
Things that are made into vodka.
Vodka can be made from different things:
The process to make vodka is:
"Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called ""akvavit"" (Latin ""aqua vitae"", ""water of life"") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled. When the vodka is bottled, it is ready for drinking."
History.
"Most people think the name ""vodka"" comes from the Slavic word for water in its diminutive form, ""little water"". The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405. The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8, 1751. It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka, as sources provide various views on this topic (though it's important to remember that the first mention of the word ""vodka"" in Cyrillic refers to a medicinal drink bought by the merchants of Kievan Rus from Poland). It is also worth noting that vodka was first used as medicine. When it became a popular drink, it was first known in Polish as ""gorzałka"" - from the Old Polish word ""gorzeć"", meaning burn. At first, gorzałka was a people's drink, but in the Slavic countries it soon became common among the nobility as well. it is worth noting that the common Ukrainian word for vodka is ""horilka"" which bears an extremely close resemblance to the Polish gorzalka. Both words roots have the same meaning (""hority"" - to burn; ""gorzeć"", also to burn)"
Different kinds of vodka.
"There are two basic kinds of Vodka: clear vodka and flavored vodka. Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better. Contrary to popular belief, flavoured vodka is not new - it has been a part of Polish drinking tradition for centuries. It is only relatively recently in history that clear and flavoured vodkas have found their way to Western countries such as the UK or US."
How vodka is consumed.
"Vodka is either drunk pure, or cocktails are made with it. The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice. Usually, vodka is drunk during a longer meal. Usually salty or sour things (not sweets) are served. In Poland and Russia (as well as some of their neighbours, such as Ukraine or Lithuania), vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams (0,1 litres) of vodka. The glass is usually emptied in one draught, while holding the breath. Directly afterwards something small is eaten. In most Eastern European countries it is consumed with pickled cucumbers. Before drinking, a toast is given."
Cultural.
"Vodka is a key element of Slavic tradition in some countries of Eastern Europe (especially Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). It has also spread to become a part of national culture in Baltic countries like Lithuania and Nordic countries like Sweden. It's traditional in Russia and other Slavic countries (as well as some Roma communities in Eastern Europe) to put a glass of vodka with a slice of bread (usually black bread) on top on graves or near photos of the deceased in their memory. This is similar to what people in Western countries do with flowers."
Sexual reproduction
Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.
"In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process."
"Shakur's friend and labelmate from Death Row Records, Marion ""Suge"" Knight, was in the car with Shakur. Knight survived the shooting."
"In 1998, a prime suspect in Shakur’s murder, Orlando Anderson (aka Baby Lane) was killed in another drive-by shooting. Shakur once attacked Anderson."
"In 2002, reporter Chuck Phillips wrote in the ""Los Angeles Times"" that another rapper called Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) could have paid members of the Crips street gang to kill Shakur and that he could have given them the gun."
Legacy.

"Close to the Norwegian coast is a deep trench (700 m), the rest of the sea is shallow. Oil and gas are produced from rigs in the Skagerrak."
Kattegat
"Kattegat is a sea in the northern part of Europe between the Danish peninsula Jutland, the Danish island Zealand, and the western coast of Sweden."
To the north-west is Skagerrak. Kattegat is connected to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits and Belts.
"The sea is shallow, and life conditions are threatened by loss of oxygen in the water. The oxygen loss is caused by pollution. The pollution originates from farming. A century ago, the sea was very rich in cod, herring, and salmon, which were important sources of food in the countries around the sea."
Baltic Sea
"The Baltic Sea is a sea in northern Europe between Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany."
"Many big rivers in the surrounding countries drain into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is connected to the ocean through the narrow and shallow Danish straits and belts. For this reason, the water has a low amount of salt, so the northern parts of the sea freeze over in the winter. The ice can carry cars, and roads are established every winter between the islands in the archipelagos between Sweden and Finland."
"For several thousand years, the Baltic Sea has connected the countries at her shores. For that reason there are many cultural similarities in these countries. Since all of these countries are European, this sea is also considered European."
Scandinavia
"Scandinavia is a group of countries in northern Europe. Scandinavia is also the smallest region in Europe. Scandinavia has Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Some people also think Finland is part of Scandinavia. Others also say Iceland and the Faroe Islands should count. Most of the time, ""Scandinavia"" is used to mean places where people speak Scandinavian languages, also called North Germanic languages or Nordic. The Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese) are very similar to each other, and many Scandinavians understand parts of the other languages because they are alike in some ways. Finnish is not part of the North Germanic language group."
"What people mean when they say ""Scandinavia"" depends on what they think is important at the time. When people want to talk about about maps, natural land formations and how the economy works, they may say Finland is part of Scandinavia but Iceland is not. When people want to talk about history and what languages people speak, they say Iceland is part of Scandinavia but Finland is not."
"The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea. Norway, Sweden and some of Finland are on this peninsula. However, Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia in the ethnic sense more often than Finland is. This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not."
"Some people like to say ""Nordic countries"" instead of ""Scandinavia"" because they think it is more correct about geography. The Nordic countries include Norway, Sweden, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, and Iceland. These five countries use the Nordic Council to work together on political and cultural activities. Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are also members of the European Union, but only Finland is part of the eurozone, meaning that it uses the Euro as its money. The other Nordic countries still use their own money, called ""krone"" or ""krona"" (from the word ""crowns""). Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU, are members of NATO and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO."
Geography.
"Most of the Scandinavian Peninsula has only a few people in it. It has large forests of pine, birch, and spruce trees. The western and northern parts are mountainous; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world. The tallest mountain is Galdhøpiggen in Norway. Denmark (43,098 km2) is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. It is more densely populated, and most of the land is farmland. Sweden (449,964 km2) is the largest of the Scandinavian countries. It has the most lakes, and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west (along the border with Norway) to tundra in the north. The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland, where the Sami people live. Some of them still herd reindeer, but most Sami live in modern houses and have modern jobs, like other Scandinavians."
Vikings.
"The most famous group of Scandinavians is the Vikings of the Middle Ages. The Vikings attacked and raided but they were also traders, traveling to the Ukraine and starting trade routes to the Middle East."
"Vikings from Norway were explorers, crossing the North Atlantic in their longships. They came to Iceland and Greenland and built towns and farms there. The Norwegian explorers also came to the east coast of Canada, where they set up at least one settlement, but it did not last into modern times."
"The Vikings from Denmark came to England, where they affected the history and politics and even the English language. Danish raiders attacked England many times with great violence. Sometimes the Danes would ask that the English pay them to go away. These payments were called ""Danegeld"" (Danish gold). The priests and bishops of churches on the east coast of England wrote a famous prayer: ""deliver us, O Lord, from the wrath of the Norsemen!"" ""Norsemen"" is another way to say ""men from the north,"" or the Danes."
Scandinavians in fiction and theater.
"At first Frederick William tried to follow a policy of neutrality in the Napoleonic Wars. But in the end he entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the Battle of Jena-Auerstädt, the French defeated the Prussian army, and it collapsed. The royal family fled to East Prussia, where Emperor Alexander I of Russia (who, rumour has it, had fallen in love with Queen Louise) helped them against Napoleon."
"But Alexander was defeated as well. At Tilsit France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the Elbe, and had to pay for French troops that occupied Prussia."
"Although Frederick William himself resigned to Prussia's fate, his ministers set about a reform of Prussia's administration and military."
After Napoleon's defeat in Russia (1813) Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814.
"At the Congress of Vienna, Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia. After the war, Frederick William did not keep the promises he had made in 1813 to supply Prussia with a constitution."
"He died on 7 June 1840. His eldest son, Frederick William IV, succeeded him."
Population growth
"Population growth is the rate at which a population grows or expands. For example, if a population increased from 100 to 110 in a year, then it would have had a population growth of 10% per year."
World population.
"World population has been rising since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350."
"Population began growing rapidly in the Western world during the industrial revolution. Several factors were notable: the coming of modern agriculture, and the control of epidemic diseases (black death, cholera, typhus). Modern water engineering brought clean water to many large cities. Deaths from world wars, especially WWI, reversed the trend, but only for a while."
"The most significant increase in the world's population has been since the 1950s in Asia and Latin America. Medical advances, and increases in farming, have been the main causes."
"A single example is both astonishing and revealing. Since 1945, half the forests of Indonesia have been replaced with farmland. As late as 1900, Indonesia was still a densely forested country: forests covered 84 percent of the total land area. Deforestation became serious in the 1970s, and has gone faster since then. About 170 million hectares (estimated in 1900) decreased to less than 100 million hectares by the end of the 20th century. In 2008, it was estimated that tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in a decade. Of the total logging in Indonesia, up to 80% is said to be done illegally."
"Olathe, Kansas"
"Olathe is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States. It is also the county seat of Johnson County. In 2010, 125,872 people lived in Olathe. It is the fourth biggest city in Kansas. By 2018, the Census Bureau estimated 139,605 people lived in Olathe."
History.
19th century.
"Olathe was created by Dr. John T. Barton in Spring 1857. He came to the center of Johnson County, Kansas. He later told about his ride to friends: ""...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful."" Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say ""Beautiful"" in his native language. The interpreter responded, ""Olathe."""
"Olathe was incorporated in 1857. It was not the first city in Johnson County. Because it grew very quickly, it became the county seat in October 1859. Growing hatred across the United States about the issue of slavery led to many fights between abolitionist settlers and nearby slave state Missouri. These fights would grow, and they would become a part of the bigger fight known as Bleeding Kansas. When Kansas became a state in 1861, it was a free state. When it became a state, violence stopped. Peace, however, would continue to elude Olathe for many years to come. In 1861 Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It had one company of soldiers, and it had the local militia."
"On September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led guerrilla Confederate soldiers in an attack against Olathe. A half dozen people died, and most of the city was destroyed. Quantrill captured the outpost, and he tried forcing the men to fight for the Confederacy. Kansas militia continued to stay in the Olathe military post for the rest of the Civil War."
"Confederate soldiers would try to attack Olathe two more times. The first time happened on August 20–21, 1863 as Quantrill was going through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid happened on October 24-5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price with 10,000 men went through on their retreat South (see Price's Raid)."
"When the Confederates surrendered, the military post was ended in August 1865."
21st century.
"In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau said Olathe was the 24th fastest-growing city in the United States. The same year, CNN/Money and ""Money"" magazine said Olathe was #11 on its list of the ""100 Best Cities to Live in the United States."""
"On February 22, 2017, Adam Purinton said racial things and shot at crowded Austins Bar and Grill in southern Olathe. He shot and injured three people. One person died. The victims were Alok Madasani, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, and Ian Grillot. Purinton was later arrested in Clinton, Missouri. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. This shooting got international attention because two of the victims were Indian."
Geography.
"The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water. Olathe has two public lakes: Lake Olathe and Cedar Lake with ."
Olathe's Black Bob Park is named after Hathawekela Shawnee Chief Black Bob.
Weather.
Olathe has a humid continental climate. It has cold winters and hot summers. Temperatures range from an average high of and low in January to an average high of nearly in July. The temperature reaches an average of 36 days per year and an average of 3 days per year. The minimum temperature falls below freezing (32 °F) on average of 102 days per year. It does not go below very often.
"The first ""The Legend of Zelda"" game was the fifth best-selling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. ""The Wind Waker"" was the fourth best-selling game for the GameCube. ""Twilight Princess"" had sold well. In the PAL region, which covers most of Asia, Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Western Europe, ""Twilight Princess"" is the best-selling ""Zelda"" game ever. During its first week, the game was sold with three out of every four Wii purchases. The game had sold 4.52 million copies on the Wii as of March 1, 2008. 1.32 million copies were sold on the GameCube as of March 31, 2007."
Awards and recognition.
"The name of the main character of the PC game ""Daikatana"", Hiro Miyamoto, is for Miyamoto. The character Gary Oak from the Pokémon anime series is named Shigeru in Japan. He is the rival of Ash Ketchum (called Satoshi in Japan). Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri was mentored by Miyamoto."
"In 1998, Miyamoto was the first person to be in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. In 2006, Miyamoto was made a ""Chevalier"" (knight) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres."
"On November 28, 2006, Miyamoto was in ""TIME Asia""'s ""60 Years of Asian Heroes,"" alongside Hayao Miyazaki, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Bruce Lee and the Dalai Lama. He was later one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 and also in 2008. At the Game Developers Choice Awards, on March 7, 2007, Miyamoto received the Lifetime Achievement Award. Both GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the ""Top Ten Game Creators"" and the ""Top 100 Game Creators of All Time""."
"He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in the Spanish-speaking world, the Prince of Asturias Award."
Personal Life.
"Miyamoto has a wife, Yasuko, and two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency. His daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he knows some English, he is not fluent and would rather speak in Japanese for interviews."
"Miyamoto usually does not sign autographs. He is worried that if he signs an autograph for one person, many other people will ask for autographs too. He also does not appear on Japanese television because he likes privacy. More foreign tourists than Japanese people recognize him."
"Miyamoto does not spend much time playing video games in his personal time. He likes playing the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He likes bluegrass music. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku. The dog was why Miyamoto wanted to create ""Nintendogs"". He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. He has been quoted as saying, ""Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock and roll."""
"Miyamoto like to move the furniture in his house, even late at night. He also said that he has a hobby of guessing how long something is, then checking to see if he was correct. He carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showed his hobby on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"". He also played the ""Super Mario Bros."" theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show."
Individual
Individual can be an adjective or a noun.
"As an adjective, a living thing that is individual is not in a group (by him/her/itself). An object that is individual is for only one person or thing (not shared by a group). Something that is individual can also be different from anyone else (unique)."
"As a noun, an individual is only one person or thing, not a group. An individual can also mean someone who is different from anyone else (one a kind)."
Truck
"A truck (or lorry in British English) is a motor vehicle used to transport goods. The word ""truck"" comes from the Greek word ""trochos"", which means ""wheel"". Most trucks use diesel fuel."
Sizes of trucks.
Light trucks.
"""Light trucks"" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb). Light trucks are only a little heavier than vans or pickup trucks, but require a special driver's license."
Medium trucks.
"""Medium trucks"" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size. Medium trucks have usually two axles: one at front and one at rear. The rear wheels may be coupled (that is: two wheels hitched together) to enable heavier load, but they may also be single."
Heavy trucks.
"""Heavy trucks"" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as ""lorries"". Usually heavy trucks have three axles: one at front and two at rear, and the rear axles have coupled wheels to enable heavy loads. Often heavy trucks pull trailers. They can be either ""full trailers"" which have both front and rear axles or boggies and their own brakes, and are connected to the towing truck with a towbar, or ""semi-trailers"", which are attached to a special kind of a truck called ""tractor unit"" with a turntable coupling (""fifth wheel""). A semi-trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit. The tractor unit has an engine and the semi-trailer does not. Driving a heavy truck requires a professional driver's license. Truck drivers are called ""truckers""."
"The laws of various countries say what kind of vehicle combinations are allowed. A semi-trailer can be converted into a full trailer with using a ""dolly"". A dolly is a small trailer which has only a bogie (= set of wheels), fifth wheel coupling for the semi-trailer and a towbar. Using a dolly, the semi-trailer can now be hitched to an ordinary cargo-carrying truck and does not need a tractor unit."
A heavy truck-trailer combination is often called a big rig or eighteen-wheeler.
"The largest heavy trucks are the Australian ""road trains"" which may have up to four semi-trailers coupled to a tractor in a train-like fashion and may carry up to 200 tonnes of cargo."
Body types.
"Box trucks or Dry vans (""tilts"" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making a closed cargo room. The rear has doors. Some have a side door."
"Concrete mixers have a turning drum on back. Turning it one way mixes the concrete. Turning it the other way pushes the concrete out. The concrete goes down ""chutes"" (like large pipes with an open top). On most trucks the concrete comes out the back. Some new types have the concrete goes over the cab and down chutes in the front. Concrete is very heavy and hard to mix. Concrete mixers have to be very heavy duty."
Sleeping problems.
"A good night’s sleep is extremely important for one’s quality of life. People may have trouble going to sleep, staying asleep or getting enough sleep. This usually means that they are too sleepy in the daytime."
"There are many things that influence sleep. Also some substances, called stimulants – coffee is an example – can cause poor sleep. When people have just eaten something, the body is busy digesting what they have eaten. This can cause poor sleep, too. Worrying and stress can also cause poor sleep."
There are many diseases that cause poor sleep. Fever can lead to bad dreams. Poor sleep can be a side effect of some medications.
"Sleep disorders directly influence how a person sleeps. Examples of sleep disorders are narcolepsy, sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disorders."
The four most common sleep disorders are:
"Sleep specialists - doctors specialized in sleeping problems - often suggest better sleep hygiene to people with sleeping problems. Sleep hygiene means things people can try, such as:"
North Macedonia
"North Macedonia ( - Severna Makedonija) officially the Republic of North Macedonia ( - ""Republika Severna Makedonija""; ) is a country located on the Balkan peninsula and in Southeastern Europe. It was part of Yugoslavia. North Macedonia borders Serbia to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south, and Bulgaria to the east. The country's currency is the Macedonian denar (MKD)."
"The capital and largest city is Skopje, with more than 500,000 residents. It has many smaller cities. Some important ones are Bitola, Prilep, Tetovo, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Veles, Stip, and Strumica."
"North Macedonia is often called ""a land of lakes and mountains"". Three large lakes are on the borders of Albania and Greece, and there are many smaller ones. Sixteen mountains are higher than 2000 meters above sea level."
"North Macedonia is a member of the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO). It joined NATO on 30 March 2020. Since December 2005, it is a candidate for joining the European Union."
"The language spoken by the majority of the population is Macedonian. Albanian is also spoken by the Albanian minority (25%) living in the country. North Macedonia has two official languages, Macedonian and Albanian (since 2019)."
History.
"Ethnic Macedonians are Slavic peoples. The Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. What is now North Macedonia used to be the Bulgarian occupation zone of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Vardarska Macedonia became a Communist state in 1945 and called itself the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the southeastern part of the country of Yugoslavia. When that country broke up in 1991, North Macedonia became independent."
In past centuries the territory which today is the Republic of North Macedonia was ruled by many different states such as Bulgaria and many other empires.
"During the Yugoslav Wars, Macedonia was mostly peaceful. However in 2001, fighting broke out between ethnic Albanians and Slavic Macedonians. The fighting ended with the Ohrid Agreement."
Earliest residents.
"People have been living in North Macedonia for thousands of years. Neolithic people lived in Macedonia from 7000 to 3500 BCE. The Iliad mentions the Kingdom of Paeonia in Macedonia. From 1000 to 1 BCE, Dacians, Thracians,Illyrians, Celts, and Greeks lived in Northern Macedonia."
Alexander the Great's empire.
"The Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia was just hundreds of small, independent, city-states. One example of a city state is Illyria. They sometimes merged together, but not often. One city-state that grew over time was the kingdom of Macedon. The Greek kingdom of Macedon is best known for Alexander the Great. He invaded and controlled the Middle East (excluding Arabia),Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gujarat state of India. However, when Alexander died in 323 BCE, at the age of 33, he lost his vast empire. The empire was divided into 5 countries, Lysimachia (Macedon), Cassander (Northern Greece), the Antigonid Empire (Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Southern Greece), the Ptolemaic Empire (Egypt), and the Seleucid Empire (Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan)."
Roman rule.
"Towards the end of the 3rd century BCE, the Romans invaded the Balkan peninsula. Illyria was taken over in 9 CE. The North and East of Macedonia were taken over by the Roman Empire in the year 29 CE. They became the Roman province of Moesia. Starting in the 3rd century CE, the borders of Macedonia were being attacked by the Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and others. In 395 AD, the Roman Empire split in two. They were the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)."
Byzantine rule.
"Although, Macedonia was part of the Byzantine Empire, there was little Byzantine influence. In the mid-6th century, Slavic tribes started to settle in Macedonia. From the 7th century to the 13th century, Byzantine Macedonia was governed by local princes and kings, allied with the Byzantine Empire. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to Macedonia. The people who brought Christianity to Macedonia were saints Cyril and Methodius. Their goal was to bring Christianity and the Cyrillic alphabet to Slavs in Europe."
Ottoman rule.
"The Ottoman Empire was originally a small city-state in Turkey. The city-state grew, and it invaded Adrianople in 1354. From there, it expanded and took over Turkey. Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, did not get invaded by the Ottomans until 1453. After the Battle of the Maritsa River, the Ottomans conquered southern Serbia and Macedonia. Macedonia was under Ottoman Rule until 1913."
Yugoslav rule.
"After the Ottoman Empire dissolved, Macedonia became a part of the newly formed country Yugoslavia. From 1914 to 1941, Yugoslavia was a monarchy. During WW2, the Axis Powers took over Yugoslavia. Macedonia was taken over by Bulgaria. The Axis powers left Yugoslavia after WW2. After WW2, Yugoslavia became a communist state. Josip Broz Tito was the leader of Yugoslavia from 1944 to 1980. In 8 September 1991, Macedonia became an independent state."
Naming dispute with Greece.
"Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia were arguing over the name Macedonia. The United Nations calls the Republic of North Macedonia, ""the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" (FYROM) (Macedonian: ""Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија - ПЈРМ"" - ""Poranešna Jugoslovenska Republika Makedonija -PJRM""). The north and northeast part of Greece has been called Macedonia for ages and officially since 1912, just like Kent, the southeast county of England, has been called Kent for a long time. 'FYROM' is also used by NATO and many other international organisations. But, many countries now call the country 'Republic of Macedonia'. The United Kingdom, for example, uses Republic of Macedonia in the diplomatic list."
"The busiest railway station in the world is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, Japan. The largest station is Nagoya Station in Nagoya, Japan. The busiest station in Europe is Clapham Junction in south London in the United Kingdom. At peak times, there is one train every 13 seconds there."
Station facilities.
"Railway stations usually have either ticket booths, or ticket machines. Ticket sales can also be together with an information desk or a shop. Many stations have a shop or a kiosk."
"Bigger stations often have fast-food or restaurants. In some countries these stations also have a bar, or a pub. Other station facilities are: toilets, luggage rooms, lost-and-found (lost property office), timetables, trolleys, waiting rooms, taxi ranks and bus stops."
Railway track
"A railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel. They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another. (In America, people say railroad as well as railway). Often, there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line. For example, trains go east on one track and west on the other one."
"The rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals (called sleepers or ties), which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground. They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart (called the gauge). Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete. These often rest on ballast, which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place. Tracks are often made better by ballast tampers."
"The upper surfaces of the rails are inclined slightly towards each other, typically on a slope of 1/20, and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way (""coning""). This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track. Each wheel also has a flange, which sticks out from one edge all the way around. This makes sure the train does not ""derail"" (come off the track) and helps guide the train on sharp curves."
Rail transport
"Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles called trains, made to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps trade and economic growth. Railways (UK) or railroads (North America) provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads."
Rail transport started to be important in the Industrial Revolution. The first railroads were built in England.
Waterway
"A waterway is any body of water that can be used for transportation by people in boats. These include rivers, lakes, oceans, and canals."
"They must be wide and deep enough for the boats, and either have no waterfalls and rapids, or have ways for boats to get around them, such as locks."
Terminus
"Terminus is a Latin word that literally means ""Boundary stone"" but can refer to:"
Junction
"A junction is any place where linear things, especially roads and railway tracks, meet."
A Road junction is a place where roads meet. These are known as 'T' junctions and 'X' junctions.
Railway junction.
A railway junction is a place where two railway tracks join. The shape of a junction looks like
Sometimes the trains just cross and keep going straight ahead to their destination. Sometimes they turn onto the other track to reach the planned destination. Moveable portions of track make this possible.
Station
"Station has many meanings, so it is often used with other words to tell people which one is meant:"
In transport:
In communications:
Some people get strep throat more often than others. Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat. Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils. Waiting is also appropriate.
Treatment.
"Strep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment. Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker. The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness. For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms."
Pain medication.
"Medicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat. These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen. Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine. Aspirin may be used in adults. It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome."
Antibiotic medicine.
"Penicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat. It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money. Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe. In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever. Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment. The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms. The average length is three to five days. Antibiotics lowers this by about one day. These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness. The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications. These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections. The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects. Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication. Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads. The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin. Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies. Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis). Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition."
Outlook.
"The symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses. They also make it harder to spread the illness. Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics."
These very bad problems might be caused by strep throat:
Likelihood.
Strep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis. About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year. Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses. The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children. It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults. Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring.

Angel Stadium of Anaheim
"Angel Stadium of Anaheim is a baseball park in Anaheim, California. It is the home field of the Los Angeles Angels. It opened in 1966. It has had several names over the years. It began as Anaheim Stadium."
Guaranteed Rate Field
"Guaranteed Rate Field is a baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Chicago White Sox. It opened in 1991, replacing historic Comiskey Park. Before U.S. Cellular, a wireless telephone carrier, bought naming rights in 2003, with the stadium then being renamed U.S. Cellular Field, the ballpark was known as ""New Comiskey Park"" or just ""Comiskey Park"", in honor of the old park."
"The stadium name lost most of its value in Chicago after the company sold its local network to Sprint in 2012. During the 2016 MLB season, the White Sox made a new deal with Chicago-based mortgage lender Guaranteed Rate. The stadium name officially changed on November 1 of that year."
Kauffman Stadium
"The Kauffman Stadium is a baseball park in Kansas City, Missouri. The Kansas City Royals play there."
LoanDepot Park
"LoanDepot Park (originally Marlins Park) is a baseball park in the Miami, Florida neighborhood of Little Havana that is home to the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball. Before LoanDepot Park opened in 2012, the team, then known as the Florida Marlins, played home games at the venue now known as Hard Rock Stadium. LoanDepot Park is located on the former site of the Orange Bowl Stadium."
"On March 31, 2021, the Miami Marlins announced that the team had sold naming rights to Marlins Park to LoanDepot. The name of the baseball park was changed to LoanDepot Park."
Vichy France
"The Vichy France or the French State was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine. It also governed the French colonial empire. It was led by Philippe Pétain, notable for helping to win World War I. When the French and British armies lost the Battle of Dunkirk and the rest of the Battle of France was being lost, the French Parliament made him Prime Minister. He negotiated an armistice with the Germans, agreeing to be neutral in World War II. Pétain became Head of State, effectively dictator, and usually did what the Germans told him to do."
"The Axis powers militarily occupied northern France and part of the southeast. The Vichy government, as a client state of Germany, controlled the ""Free Zone"" or unoccupied parts of France until November1942. The German army ran the Northern half. In 1944, the Vichy government, now effectively a puppet state, moved to Nazi Germany, and later disbanded. It became known as Vichy France after World War II."
Anguilla
Anguilla is a group of five islands in the Caribbean Sea. The islands are ruled by the United Kingdom.
"Anguilla was colonized by the British Empire and used to be part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis, but broke away in 1980 so it could stay part of Great Britain. Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent."
"It is named after the Spanish word for ""eel"", because it has such a shape."
Anguilla was first settled by Arawakan-speaking Indians who called it Malliouhana.
Politics.
"The King or Queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a governor. He or she names, or ""appoints"" the governor, and he is just working there in place of the monarch. The legislature is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly."
Economy.
"Anguilla has mostly been part of the British Empire since the 17th century. The British brought thousands of slaves from Africa and forced them to work, like they did all over the Caribbean and North America. Many of the slaves decided to run away rather than be forced to work. When the British decided to abolish slavery they paid all the slave owners a lot of money, but didn't give anything to the slaves. Now Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism."
Culture.
"Most people in Anguilla are Protestants, and speak English."
Bermuda
"Bermuda (/bɜrˈmjuːdə/ ""Ber-myu-dah""; officially, the Bermudas or Somers Islands) is a British overseas territory in the North Atlantic Ocean. The land has one main island and 180 smaller islands. Bermuda is a popular tourist place, with mild weather during the winter months."
"Off the east coast of the United States, Bermuda's nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, about 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373 kilometres (853 mi) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and 1,770 kilometres (1,100 mi) northeast of Miami, Florida. Its capital city is Hamilton."
History.
"in 1505 by Spanish navigator Juan de Bermúdez (who said it to be inhabited only with pigs), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas."
Geography.
"The country is in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea. It is about 580 nautical miles (1070 km, 670 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 590 nautical miles (1100 km, 690 mi) southeast of Martha's Vineyard. The island is due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina. It has 103 km (64 mi) of coastline."
"The territory has 181 islands. The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 sq mi). The largest island is ""Main Island"", sometimes itself called ""Bermuda""."
Climate.
"Bermuda has a subtropical climate. The weather is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around The temperature rarely drops below 10 °C"
Bermuda is very likely to be affected by hurricanes. The island's small size means that direct landfalls are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003.
The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall. It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.
Flora and fauna.
"When discovered, Bermuda had no people. It was mostly covered by forests of Bermuda cedar, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 vascular plant species are considered native. Of those 15, including the cedar, are endemic."
"Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda. Coconut palms grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species. While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit."
"The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats. All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ""Lasionycteris noctivagans"", ""Lasiurus borealis"", ""Lasiurus cinereus"", ""Lasiurus seminolus"" and ""Perimyotis subflavus"". Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the Bermuda Petrel, and the Bermuda Rock Skink. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of terrapin predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago."
"Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory is the Northern Territory Government agency which aim for tasks such as the establishment of ""parks, reserves, sanctuaries and other land"", the management of these and the ""protection, conservation, sustainable use of wildlife etc."

Game of Death Redux
"Game of Death Redux (死亡遊戲 Redux) is a 2019 special features distributed with the movie ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"""
Background.
"In 1978 the ""Golden Harvest"" has released ""Game of Death"" (""死亡遊戲""). The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot. The revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original ""The Game of Death (1972)""."
Creation of special feature.
"But on 2019 producer ""Alan Canvan"" edited ""Game of Death Redux"". The edit only uses footage shot during the original production of ""The Game of Death"". The movie was released as a special feature in ""The Criterion Collection's"" Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020."
"It was presented closely the way Bruce intended. While at the same time, keeping in-tact some of the stronger as aspects of the universally panned, pieced together 1978 movie (known to fans as Game of Death ’78), such as John Barry’s acclaimed score, as well some of the film’s strong audio design."
New Version on 2022.
"There is a second version of ""Game of Death Redux"" on 2022."
"With the first version Alan Canvan had concentrated entirely on the flow of the piece. But he was not satisfied to how the shots were cut and how the music drove the narrative artistically. Canvan wanted a complete visual and sound restoration. So he got help from a new team. After a year the new Redux has been fully restored with a brand-new color grade and audio mix. Additionally, Chris Kent, who looped Bruce’s war cries for Robert Clouse’s Game of Death movie, lent his voice once again to match the audio portions from 1978. Finally, reworking a dozen sequences resulted in a much more concise and dramatic presentation of the narrative."
Legacy.
"Canvan’s Game of Death Redux was the latest project that focused on Bruce Lee’s original 1972 storyline, a subject that was previously explored in John Little’s 2000 documentary, and Artport’s Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 (released in Japan the same year), not to mention a series of fan edits that have been circulating the internet. All aforementioned edits use 1972-era The Game of Death footage that was initially discovered by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan, who stumbled upon the footage in the now-defunct Golden Harvest studio vaults back in 1999."
The Game of Death.
"The Game of Death (""死亡的遊戲"") is an incomplete ""Hong Kong"" martial arts film, of 39 minutes (approximatley two minutes is missing from the beginning), filmed in 1972, directed, written, produced by and starring ""Bruce Lee"", as Hai Tien, with ""Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"", as Mantis, ""James Tien"", ""Chieh Yuan"", ""Dan Inosanto"", ""Ji Han-jae"" and ""Hwang In-shik"" (only a short footage outdoors). Unifinished because of Bruce Lee's death. Produced company ""Concord Production Inc."" and ""Golden Harvest"". The 1972 original footage it was distributed in 2000 by two documentaries, """" and "" Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯"" and 2019 by short film ""Game of Death Redux"". The 1972 original script it was distributed by short film ""The Story""."
Plot.
"During a search is discovered among the choreography writings, hand-written storyline, 12 pages in length and containing all scene breakdowns and select dialogue passages the original storyline stands in sharp contrast to the one presented in the film ""Game of Death (1978 movie)"". After the discovery of Lee's script notes in 2000 it was directed the short film ""The Story"". The movie is the storyline for ""The Game of Death"" and the missing part of ""Bruce Lees ""The Game of Death"", not played in 1972. Directed in ""South Korea"" by ""John Little"", distributed as a special feature in DVD of the documentary '."

Battle of Finnburg
"The Battle of Finnburg was a battle between the Frisians and the Danes. It was mentioned in two early medieval writings, the Finnesburg Fragment and ""Beowulf"". These may describe a real or a completelymythical event."
Story.
"According to the Finnesburg Fragment, the Danish prince Hnaef came with sixty followers to visit and spent the winter at the Finnburg. Finnburg was the fort of his brother-in-law Finn, king of the Frisians. There a fight started between the Frisians and the Danes. A battle took place that lasted for three days. The verses of the story that were found (which is thought to be a small part of the original work) do not explain why the fight started, nor do they give the outcome of the battle."
"In a passage of ""Beowulf"", a bard sings a song about the ending of the battle, here named ""Freswael"". This is the same story as in the Finnesburg Fragment. While in less detail, the ""Beowulf"" episode is complete. Here it is seen that the Frisians won the battle. The Danish prince Hnaef and Finn's son died in the battle. After the fighting, the parties make peace, and the new Danish leader ""Hingest"" (who some have identified as Hengest) is allowed to leave with the surviving Danes."

"The Moose River Plains Wild Forest is a forest in Adirondack Park, which is in the Hamilton and Herkimer counties in the U.S. state of New York. It is designated a Wild Forest by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation."
Caspar Wessel
"Caspar Wessel (June 8, 1745 – March 25, 1818) was a Danish-Norwegian mathematician."
"He was born in Jonsrud, Vestby, Akershus, Norway. In 1763, having completed secondary school, he went to Denmark for further studies (since Norway didn't have any university in 1763). In 1778 he got the degree of ""candidatus juris"", which is one law degree. In 1794 he was hired as a surveyor; in 1798, a Royal inspector of Surveying."
"As surveying is related to mathematics, he later studied the geometrical importance of complex numbers. His most important paper, ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"", (""On the Analytical Representation of Direction"") was published in 1799 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Since it was in Danish, it was not noticed by many people. Later, Jean-Robert Argand and Carl Friedrich Gauss's paper showed the same results."
"One of the more important, but missed ideas shown in Wessel's ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"" was vectors. Wessel's main thing he wanted to show in the paper was not this, but he felt that the concept of numbers, with length and direction would be needed. Wessel's thoughts on addition was: ""Two straight lines are added if we unite them in such a way that the second line begins where the first one ends and then pass a straight line from the first to the last point of the united lines. This line is the sum of the united lines"". Today, the same idea is used when adding vectors."
"His paper was printed in a French translation in 1899. It was released in English in 1999 as ""On the analytic representation of direction"" (ed. J. Lützen et al.)."
"Johan Herman Wessel, Wessel's brother was a famous person in Denmark-Norway."
Global Handwashing Day
Global Handwashing Day is a campaign to encourage people around the world to wash their hands with soap. It takes place on October 15 of each year. The campaign's goal is to raise awareness of handwashing with soap as a key way to prevent diseases with hygiene.
"The holiday was made at the annual World Water Week 2008, which was held in Stockholm from August 17 to 23. Out of this week came the Public Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW). The Global Handwashing Day took place for the first time on October 15, 2008, the date appointed by United Nations General Assembly to go along with the year 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation."
The theme for Global Handwashing Day’s inaugural year was Focus on School Children. The members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than seventy countries.
500 home run club
"In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a term given to the group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs. This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974. Aaron's ending career total, 755, stayed the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Albert Pujols is the most recent to reach 500 home runs; he hit his 500th home run on April 22, 2014. Twenty-six players are members of the 500 home run club."
"Of these 26 players, 14 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters (meaning they could bat from either side of the plate). The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster: Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds. Four 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, and Rafael Palmeiro—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Alex Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to hit 500. Ted Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest."
"Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years. Four club members who are now eligible for election to the Hall of Fame—Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Palmeiro—have not been elected. Eligibility requires that a player has ""been retired five seasons"" or be dead for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Also, several of these recent members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall, the voters were starting a ""guideline"" on how they would treat players from the ""Steroid Era"". Since then, Bonds and Sosa have also failed to earn election. Most recently, Palmeiro became the first club member to be dropped from the Hall of Fame ballot, failing to earn enough votes (5% of votes cast) in the 2014 election to stay on the ballot."
Whittier Daily News
"The Whittier Daily News is the local daily newspaper for Whittier, California. The ""Daily News"" is a member of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, a division of MediaNews Group.

Municipalities.
"Sweden is further divided into 290 municipalities. The municipalities are responsible for many social issues, like schools, daycare centers, the care for older and disabled people and fire departments."
Religion.
"Sweden has been Christian for a thousand years. Sweden is traditionally a Protestant country, but it is now one of the least religious countries in the world. Statistical surveys say 46-85% of all people in Sweden are agnostics or atheists. This means that they doubt or they do not believe in the existence of a god. About 6.4 million people in Sweden, which is 67% of all the people, are members of the Church of Sweden, but only 2% of members go to church often."
Music.
"In popular music, ABBA, Roxette, The Cardigans, Europe, Entombed, At the Gates, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Hypocrisy, Grave, Dissection, Avicii, Tove Lo, Laleh, Watain, and Ace of Base have had several hits throughout the years."
Sports.
"Sweden is a country with many talented athletes, such as soccer player Zlatan Ibrahimović. Sweden (men and women's teams combined) has five bronze medals and two silver medals from the World Cup in football (soccer). The soccer league in Sweden is called Allsvenskan (men's) and Damallsvenskan (women's). Sweden has also performed well in ice hockey. The men's ice hockey top division in Sweden is called SHL and the women's SDHL. Sweden has also had several successful table tennis players, including Stellan Bengtsson and Jan-Ove Waldner, as well as alpine skiers including Ingemar Stenmark, Pernilla Wiberg, and Anja Pärson. Other champions include biathlete Magdalena Forsberg and tennis players Björn Borg, Mats Wilander, Stefan Edberg, and Jonas Björkman. Swimmer Sara Sjöström has several gold, silver and bronze medals from the Olympic Games and holds several world records."
"Sweden also succeeds in cross-country skiing, having won several medals in the Olympic Games."

Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born American scientist. He worked on theoretical physics. He developed the theory of relativity. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.
"His famous equation is formula_1 (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light (energy = mass × speed of light²)."
"At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he made the theory of special relativity to fix it."
"Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916, he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation."
"In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States but in Germany, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power (this is before World War II). Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies. He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that the U.S. should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the U.S. became the first nation in history to create and use the atomic bomb (not on Germany but on Japan). Einstein and other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on the Manhattan Project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan."
"Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of his life."
He is now thought to be one of the greatest scientists of all time.
"His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity."
Life.
Early life.
"Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, on 14 March 1879. His family was Jewish, but was not very . However, later in life Einstein became very interested in his Judaism. Einstein did not begin speaking until he was 3 years old. According to his younger sister, Maja, ""He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn"". When Einstein was around 4 years old, his father gave him a magnetic compass. He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to move itself so that it always pointed north. The needle was in a closed case, so clearly nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around, and yet it moved. So in this way Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics. His compass gave him ideas to the world of science."
"When he became older, he went to school in Switzerland. After he graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote the papers that first made him famous as a great scientist."
Einstein married with a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić in January 1903.
"In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him, fortunately he survived. His cousin Elsa Löwenthal nursed him back to health. After this happened, Einstein divorced Mileva in 14 February 1919, and married Elsa on 2 June 1919."
Children.
"Einstein's first daughter was Lieserl Einstein. She was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Austria-Hungary on January 27, 1902. She spent her first years in the care of Serbian grandparents because her father Albert did not want her to be brought to Switzerland, where he had a job offer at the patent office. Some historians believe she died from scarlet fever."
Code of Silence (1985 movie)
"Code of Silence is a 1985 American action crime movie directed by Andrew Davis and starring Chuck Norris, Henry Silva, Molly Hagan, John Mahoney, Kelsey Grammer, Dennis Farina, Ralph Foody, Ron Dean, Bert Remsen. It was distributed by Orion Pictures."

Doctor Khumalo
"Theophilus ""Doctor"" Doctorson Khumalo (born 26 June 1967), also known as Doctor Khumalo, is a South African former soccer player. He is best known for being a star midfielder for Kaizer Chiefs as well as the South African national team. Khumalo is regarded as one of the best South African midfielders of his generation. He was known as a strong player who stood out for his leadership, his passing ability, dribbling, tackling, and his ability to score a goal. He won the 1996 African Cup of Nations with South Africa beating Tunisia with the score 2-0. He was named South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. His nickname was ""Doctor"" because of his intellingence in midfield. Considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of Kaizer Chiefs."
Early career.
"Khumalo started playing football in 1984 with Swallows Reserves, Khumalo then went to Kaizer Chiefs, where he initially played for the junior team. His father, Eliakim Khumalo, a renowned player of the 1970s and early 1980s, served as his mentor. Khumalo was promoted to the senior team by coach Ted Dumitru the following year, when he started a game against arch rivals Orlando Pirates."
Club career.
"Khumalo went on to become a star player for Kaizer Chiefs and did not play for any other South African soccer club, only leaving them for short overseas playing periods – he signed with FIFA agent Marcelo Houseman who first took him to Argentinian club Ferro Carril Oeste for six months in 1995, while in 1996 and 1997 he played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer."
"The high-point of Khumalo's soccer career was the 1990s; he was part of the Kaizer Chiefs teams that won three South African league championship titles and five knockout trophies and he was also voted South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. During his career at the club, he played in a total of 397 league and cup games, scoring 75 goals."
International career.
"After the re-admission of South Africa to FIFA in 1992, Khumalo was selected to be a member of the South African squad for its first official international match in July of the same year, against Cameroon. South Africa won the match 1–0, due to a penalty scored by Khumalo. He was also a leading member of the winning South African national team at the 1996 African Cup of Nations . He also represented South Africa in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Throughout his whole international career, he played for South Africa 50 times (twice as captain), scoring nine goals making him the 13th most capped South African footballer. Khumalo turned down a chance to play for the 1998 and 2000 African Cup of Nations. He made his international farewell in 2001."
"One of Doctor Khumalo's most memorable games was perhaps the 1996 Mandela Cup match, where South Africa played against Brazil. Phil Masinga scored the first goal from Doctor Khumalo's corner kick. Khumalo then scored the second goal to make the score 2–0 in favour of the South Africans. Unfortunately for Bafana, Brazil came back in the second half, scoring three goals, to win the encounter 3–2."
Personal life.
"He retired in 2002 and then in 2004 as a player-coach. Although he was a winning co-coach (with Donald ""Ace"" Khuse) of Kaizer Chiefs in the 2002–2003 season (guiding the club to a 12-game unbeaten record and earning themselves a joint Coach of the Month PSL award), Khumalo has stated that his aim is to become a soccer administrator. Since 2004, Khumalo served as a television soccer commentator and presenter, being named afterwards South African Under-17 national coach."
Khumalo was voted 62nd in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. He is married to Namibian beauty queen Blanche Garises.
Coaching career.
"He has a SAFA Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 coaching licences, an English Football Association licence which he got in 2005 and a UEFA B licence through the German Football Federation in 2007. He previously worked as head coach for the Kaizer Chiefs Under-17 team and together with Khuse. He was the assistant coach for Kaizer Chiefs"
Acting career.
"Khumalo made his film acting debut with the German/South African production Themba. He plays himself as the coach of the under 21s. The movie is about Themba, a young and ambitious football youth, who is faced with poverty, AIDS and violence, but eventually makes his way on to the South African national team. The film is based on a novel by Lutz van Dijk and premiered at the Berlinale 2010."

The reciprocal of a number formula_34 is formula_35. A number formula_34 times its reciprocal formula_35 is always equal to 1: formula_38
"For example, the reciprocal of 3 is 1/3, because formula_39"
"To get the reciprocal of a fraction, switch the numerator and the denominator: the reciprocal of formula_40 is formula_41"
Division.
"Division is the fourth arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of multiplication. The number that is being divided is the ""dividend"" and the number it is divided by is the ""divisor"". The number on top of a fraction is called the ""numerator"" and the number at the bottom is called the ""denominator"". The result of a division is called a ""quotient""."
Division is repeated subtraction.
The symbol for division is / or a fraction.
Examples of divisions:
formula_42
formula_43
formula_44
formula_45
formula_46
"Because of the ""multiplicative identity"", any number divided by one is the same number (formula_47)."
Division by zero is undefined (formula_48).
"In a fraction, switching the numerator and the denominator gives the reciprocal of the fraction."
For example: formula_49
Exponentiation.
"Exponentiation is the fifth arithmetic operation and the third hyperoperation. It is one of the inverse operations of roots and logarithms. The number that is being multiplied is the ""base"" and the number of times it is multiplied is the ""exponent"". The result of an exponentiation is called a ""power""."
Exponentiation is repeated multiplication or division.
The symbol for exponentiation is the superscript (xy) or the caret (^).
Examples of exponentiations:
formula_50
formula_51
formula_52
formula_53
formula_54
formula_55

Draize test
"The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a ""wash out"" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site."
"The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that ""to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test"". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects ""in vitro"" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out."
Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs.
Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane
"The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product ot be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pein during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing."
Social choice theory
"Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision. Usually this is done by combining and aggregating the opinion of each member of the group. A classic problem of social choice theory is that of holding an election or a popular vote."
Year of the Three Emperors
"The Year of the Three Emperors, or the Year of the Three Kaisers, () refers to the year 1888 during the German Empire in German history. The year is important because two German Emperors, or Kaisers, died. This meant that there were three emperors in a year.. The three emperors who ruled Germany during this year were Wilhelm I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. The mnemonic “""drei Achten, drei Kaiser""” (English: ""three eights, three emperors"") is still used today in Germany to remember which year it was."
Festival.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, devotees dance to please various deities. Among them, male dancers act after the styles of Haraba (alias Pakhangba) and female dancers act after the styles of goddess Nongthang Leima. Goddess Nongthang Leima represents the lightning."

Hoseff
"Hoffish(also called hoseff) is a dialect of swedish mostly spoken in the north of scandinavia. It is often called hoffish or hope language, although locals call it by hoseff. It is one of the most least spoken languages with 642 speakers world wide. It is commonly confused with the sami language but both languages have common similarity in grammer and noun pronunciation. The language was proclaimed as a dialect of sami in 1937 although the noted differences. Little has been done to help this dying language in the past century other then a few people trying to make the language more public. As of 2021, all of its speakers speak it as a secondary language with finnish or plain sami being first."
History.
"Hoffish originally started off as a dialect of the sami language in what is guessed to be in the middle ages. All we know about its history is from Mina Napoi, who interviewed many people of the sami culture. Her findings are at the helsinki central library in finland which are currently being approved for digitalization as of February 2021. In her last two pages of her article titled, ""Saamen murre nimeltä hoseff"", she talks about how the language most likely formed as a dialect of sami in the late middle ages but then over time reformed due to the hoffish-sami group's migration. The hoffish-sami people she interviewed said that their ancestors moved a lot from northern finland to as far as southern norway while trading furs. She finally states because of this common migration that the people must of picked up a lot of new nordic words and grammer which in time turned the sami language into what the hoffish people speak today."
Famous Developments.
Here is a list of people who have contributed in making this language widespread:

"The high-altitude ""Polylepis"" forests and woodlands are found in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees are called Queñua, Yagual and other names. They grow at altitudes of above sea level. It is still unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan time. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has had a faster pace, and the trees are now endangered. Some think as little as 10% of the original woodland is still here."
Wildlife.
"The Andes has a lot of wildlife. With almost 1,000 species, of which about 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians."
"Animal diversity in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptiles (45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (1/3 endemic)."
"The Vicuña and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, live in the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers. Other animals found in the mostly open habitats of the high Andes are the huemul, cougar, and foxes in the genus ""Pseudalopex"". And for birds, some species of tinamous (they are members of the genus ""Nothoprocta""), are the Andean Goose, Giant Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), Lesser Rhea, Andean Flicker, Diademed Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches."
Meal
"A meal is a serving of food eaten by human beings. Meals usually include several different types of food, such as grains, vegetables, fruit, and in some cases, meat. Meals have different names by time they are taken or by the type of food that is eaten."
Types.
"In North America and in Europe, people usually eat three meals a day. The morning meal is called breakfast. It usually includes foods made from grain (cereal, porridge, or bread), fruit (apple, banana, or an orange), and milk products (milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese). Many people drink coffee or tea with their breakfast."
"Around noon, people eat their lunch. People who are working at jobs are given a break to eat their lunch. The lunch meal includes foods such as a sandwich, soup, vegetables, fruit, and milk. In some countries, such as Italy, people serve an alcoholic drink with lunch. In England, some people have a glass of beer with their lunch."
"In the evening, people eat their supper or dinner. Dinners are different in different countries. Usually dinners include a ""main course"" such as roast beef, a grain (such as rice or pasta), a vegetable (such as carrots or cauliflower) and a dessert (called a ""sweet"" or ""pudding"" in England)."
"In some cases, a starter or appetizer is served before the dinner. Appetizers are a small serving of food such as olives, cheese, or bread. In many countries, people serve an alcoholic drink with dinner, such as wine or beer."
Leipzig
"Leipzig (Upper Saxon: ""Leibzsch"" or ""Leibz'sch"") is the biggest city in the state of Saxony (eastern Germany). When Germany was divided into East and West Germany, Leipzig was one of the three biggest industrial cities in the East Germany."
"Leipzig occupies and is still an industrial city. 510,651 people are living in Leipzig as of 29 February 2008."
History.
"Its Latin name is ""Lipsia"" and the German name ""Leipzig"" came from this name. Leipzig has a long history. Its name was first recorded as Leipzig Castle (Leipziger Burg) in 1015, and the official founding of the city occurred later in 1165. It was an economic center of , famous with its market (Leipziger Messe)."
"In 1409, was started. Theology was its major faculty. In 1519, Martin Luther had a discussion in Leipzig against . Reformation came to Leipzig in 1539 and the city people became Lutheran."
"It is famous for , where Johann Sebastian Bach worked as music director (Kantor) from 1723 until his death in 1750."
"In 1813 near Leipzig, the Battle of Leipzig was fought between the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte and the allied armies of Austria, Prussia and Russia."
"In 1839, the railway between Dresden and Leipzig was opened. It was the first long distance railroad in Germany."
"As a result of industrialization, the number of people living in Leipzig grew during the 19th century. Before World War II, there were about 750,000 people in Leipzig."
"After the war, Leipzig belonged to the part of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union, and later to East Germany."
"In 1989, the took place in Leipzig. Every monday after a Christian mess in the the Leipzig people demonstrate for freedom to travel and democracy. These demonstrations became bigger and bigger and reached their peak on 23 October when 320,000 people came. The demonstrations are one of the things that lead to the end of communist dictatorship in East Germany."
"Today, Leipzig is still known as a city of fairs, media and university, but is less important than it was before World War II."
Economy.
"Before World War II, Leipzig was a famous center of commerce (Leipzig exhibition) and industry. Now, there are big companies in Leipzig like Porsche, BMW, Siemens and DHL, as well as the ."
Population.
"With almost 511,000 people, Leipzig city proper is the 12th biggest city in Germany and the 2nd biggest in what was East Germany (DDR), smaller than East Berlin and bigger than Dresden. Leipzig urban has 567,000 people. The total population of Leipzig metropolitan area is 1,389,000."
Geography.
"Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists while rejecting the existence or importance of polytheistic gods or goddesses. In a broader definition it can also be the belief in God or gods in general, including all types of god-belief. Polytheism is the belief in several gods, while monotheism is the belief in just one god. For example, a theistic religion is Christianity. The opposite to a theist is an atheist. An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings."
Different theisms.
All of these are rough definitions of the theisms; they are almost always different. We can split them all into different groups:
"Gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism. For example, it is possible to be an agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist. In common usage, some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism — absence of clear belief in any deity."
The main types of theism are:
"This is another way to group different theisms, based on the nature of the gods."
There are also these types:
Plesiosaur
"The plesiosaurs were an order of large, carnivorous marine reptiles. They flourished from 245 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya."
"In 1719, William Stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of Charles Darwin, Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it."
"Mary Anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Dorset, England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its skull, but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name ""Plesiosaurus"" was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare."
"The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic period,p128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They had two large pairs of paddles, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the K/T extinction event, 65 million years ago."
Description.
"Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers, making them flexible. No modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy: modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming. They were mainly piscivorous (fish-eaters)."
Pliosaurs.
"The pliosaurs were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water."
Long-necked plesiosaurs.
"There were three families of long-necked plesiosaurs, who evidently had a different life-style from the pliosaurs. It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton. It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water; aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked familiers were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish. However, some at least were bottom-feeders, consuming various prey. Digestion of shellfish was aided by gastroliths."
Gastroliths.
"Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of belemnites (squid-like animals), and ammonites (giant nautilus-like molluscs) associated with their stomachs. But plesiosaurs could not crack shells. Instead, they probably swallowed them whole. In the belly of a plesiosaur were ""stomach stones"", which are called ""gastroliths."" These stones moved around in the plesiosaur's stomach and cracked or crushed the shells of the animals it ate. One plesiosaur fossil found in South Dakota had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds."
Live birth?
"Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs, but is uncertain for plesiosaurs."
"Midland, Texas"
"Midland is a city in the American state of Texas. It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy."
"Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida."
Sardinia
"Sardinia (, Sardinian: ""Sardigna"") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an autonomous region of Italy. It was formerly the Kingdom of Sardinia."
"The official name is, in Italian, Regione Autonoma della Sardegna.The capital and largest city is Cagliari."
Geography.
The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.
People can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.
"Lotuses look rather like water lilies from the Nymphaeaceae family. It is the ""National flower"" of both India and Vietnam and also the ""Provincial flower"" of Sindh province, Pakistan."
Nymphaeaceae
"In botany, Nymphaeaceae is the name of a family of plants which grow in water. The family is also called ""water-lily family""."
Their flowers suggest they are one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants.
"Also, the Nymphaeaceae are more diverse and wdespread than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is in the order Nymphaeales. According to the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, this is the second diverging group of angiosperms after ""Amborella""."
Ugly Betty
"Ugly Betty is a Golden Globe- and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama television series. It stars America Ferrera, Vanessa Williams, and Eric Mabius. It premiered on September 28, 2006, on ABC in the United States. The series follows the life of Betty Suarez (Ferrera), and her incongruous job at the ultra-chic New York City fashion magazine ""Mode"". Betty's status as a ""fish out of water"" drives much of the plot. Ugly Betty ended on April 14, 2010 after low ratings during season 4."

Miko
"are women in the service of Shinto shrines. The translation of ""Miko"" is ""Woman of God"" (chosen by, or totally devoted to, the gods), but the closest meaning is ""shrine maiden"". In Shinto, there are priestesses; but Miko are not priestesses, because they have less authority. However, they can act as priestesses if needed. They usually help Shintoist priests."
Mineko Iwasaki
", born Masako Tanaka on November 2, 1949 in Kyoto, was Japan's number one ""geiko"" (geisha) until she retired at the age of 29. She entertained many important people when they visited Japan, like Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. She retired because she was tired of the profession, and wanted to start a family."
"Author Arthur Golden did an interview to her and used her as inspiration for his book ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", that was later made a movie. Iwasaki later said that the book was full of lies, and that nothing that Golden said ever happened to her. She put a lawsuit against Golden for this, and they solved it out of court in 2003. After the publication of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", Iwasaki wrote her autobiography, ""Geisha, A Life""."

This is a list of districts in England by population. The districts at the top have the biggest population and the districts at the bottom have a smaller number of people.
Libra (astrology)
"Libra is an astrological sign, related to the constellation Libra, in the Southern Hemisphere near Scorpius and Virgo. In the tropical zodiac, the Sun meets Libra from September 23 to October 23, and in the sidereal zodiac, it ends on November 15. Libra, (The Scales of Balance), is the only symbol of the zodiac that is inanimate (it is not represented by an animal or person). The opposite sign to Libra is Aries."
Winter larder.
"On the Moroccan island of Mogador, falcons seem to imprison small birds by trapping them in crevasses, presumably saving them to eat later."
"Mogador has the ruins of a fortress, a mosque and a prison. Today the island is a nature reserve, where Eleonora’s falcons nest among the ruins. They hunt migrating warblers, hoopoes and other birds."
"Researchers came across small birds trapped in deep cavities, their flight and tail feathers removed. The birds were unable to move their wings or use their dangling legs. Eleonora’s falcons have been seen building up larders of up to 20 dead birds during migration season, when prey is plentiful. But ""storing snacks that are still alive could be a unique behaviour"" said an expert."

Ainu people
"The Ainu people are the native population of northern Japan and the eastern part of Russia, mostly in the Amur river region, Sakhalin, the Kuril islands and on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The term is also used for their culture and language in the Ezo region (Hokkaido)."
History.
"The majority of their ancestors, the Jōmon people, arrived in Japan about 30,000 – 15,000 years ago from Central Asia and southern Siberia. They were largely replaced by the proto-Japanese which arrived from southeastern China about 2,000 years ago. The Ainu have strong similarities with Palaeolithic Europeans and people of the Middle East as well as with Native American groups of the northwestern coastal culture area in North America. Some scholars think they were related to the Emishi of northern Honshu."
"During and after the Yayoi period they were attacked by the early Japanese people. The Ainu and relative tribes lost most of their land in Honshū, many were killed or ensalved by the Yayoi-Japanese. After the rise of the Yamato, few Ainu were left in Honshu. After the Meiji restoration in the late 1800s, the Japanese began to colonize Hokkaido, sending their own people to live there. They forced the Ainu to leave the warm coast of Hokkaido and try to live in the mountains in the middle of the island. The Ainu were not allowed to fish for salmon or hunt deer. The Ainu were required to speak Japanese and use Japanese names. Japanese scientists and treasure hunters would dig up Ainu graves and steal the bodies and artifacts."
"The Ainu in Russia had more luck and lived their traditional life until the Second World War, when they were forced to act like other Russians."
"In April 2019, the Ainu became recognized as native population of northern Japan, and the rest of Japan has started to think of their culture as good and valuable. However, the Ainu still face discrimination in Japan. Most Japanese outside of Hokkaido mistake the Ainu for foreigners or tourists."
Culture.
"Their culture is based on the ancient Jomon culture of northern Japan and eastern Russia. Their native folk religion has some similarities to early Shinto. Their gods are named ""kamuy"", similar to the Japanese ""Kami"". They practiced agriculture but were also hunter gatherers. The Ainu are famous for their wood work and art."
"The Ainu lived in villages called ""kotan"" and were often built along rivers or lakes. Every villages consisted of at least four to seven families, sometimes more than ten. The traditional house was called ""cise"" or ""cisey""."
"The ""kami"" of Emperor Buretsu was venerated at a Shinto shrine in Takaichi, Yamato province."
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). Buretsu is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Prefectures of Japan
"are one of the basic local entities of Japan. They are the 47 subdivisions of the country. Prefectures are the governmental bodies of Japan which are larger than cities, towns, and villages."
History.
The former provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures between 1876 and 1879.
"The word ""todōfuken"" combines the suffixes of the names of the 47 prefectures. The four suffixes are:"
"Before World War II, different laws applied to ""fu"" and ""ken,"" but now two types of prefecture are the same, outside of their names."
Lists of prefectures.
List in Japanese ISO order.
"The prefectures are often grouped into these nine regions (""Chihō""). The regions are not formally specified, they do not have elected officials, and they are not corporate bodies. However, the practice of ordering prefectures based on their geographic region is traditional. This ordering is mirrored in Japan's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding. From north to south, the prefectures of Japan and their commonly associated regions are listed in traditional and in order:"
"Okinawa Prefecture is traditionally thought of as part of the Kyūshū region of Japan. Okinawa Prefecture is made up of islands which are southwest of the island of Kyushu. The Japanese government recognizes the prefecture as its own region in new 9-region, 11-region and 13-region systems."
List of provinces of Japan
"The List of Provinces of Japan changed over time. The number and borders of provinces evolved from the 7th century through the Meiji Period. In the 1870s, the provinces were replaced by prefectures."
"The traditional way of parsing the land of Japan was ""five provinces and seven circuits"" (""go-shichidō"")."
Five Provinces.
"The traditional five core provinces of Japan were called ""goki""."
Shichido.
"The traditional seven core circuits of Japan were called ""shichidō""."

"The island was changed from Ezo to Hokkaidō, and 11 provinces were established in 1869-1882."
Gilberto Kassab
"Gilberto Kassab ( or ; born 12 August 1960 in São Paulo) was the mayor of São Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil. He is a member of the right-wing Democrat party. Kassab became famous when he brought in laws to stop billboard advertising, which he said were ""visual pollution""."
Terra nullius
"Terra nullius means unclaimed territory. It is the correct term in international law. It means land which does not (at present) belong to any state. The term comes from the Latin, meaning ""Nobody's thing"". There is also an expression ""no man's land"", but that does not have a formal legal meaning."
"Rule over ""terra nullius"" can be got by occupying the territory. There are various legal problems about this concept, but in practice it is often the business of neighbouring states to decide by negotiation. Diplomacy may sometimes be replaced by warfare."
"Two territories that are currently ""terra nullius"" are Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan, and Marie Byrd Land, in Antarctica."
Tannhäuser
"Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg (En: ""Tannhäuser and the Singers' Contest at Wartburg"") is a three-act opera with words and music by Richard Wagner. It was Wagner's fifth opera. He worked on it between 1842 and 1845. It was first performed at the Dresden Royal Opera on 19 October 1845 with Wagner conducting. The opera was a success. It became hugely popular in Germany."
"In 1859, ""Tannhäuser"" was the first Wagner opera to be performed in the United States of America. By 1861, the opera had been performed many times in Germany when Wagner was asked to revise the work for the Paris Opéra. Despite his best efforts, Wagner failed. He was not popular. Anti-Wagner riots broke out. He withdrew the work. It was not staged again in France until 1895. Meanwhile, the opera opened the second season of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in November 1884."
Background.
"Wagner was in Paris completing ""The Flying Dutchman"" when he began thinking about writing another opera. A friend suggested Tannhäuser as a subject. Wagner did not like the tale. Back in Germany however, he gathered materials by Tieck, Heine, and others about Tannhäuser. Vacationing in Bohemia, he had a change of heart. He began preparing an outline for ""Tannhäuser"". Returning home to Dresden, he immersed himself in the tale. He completed the opera in October 1845. He conducted the first performance that month at the Royal Opera House."
"His Venus said, ""You are a genius, but you write such eccentric stuff that it is impossible to sing."" His Tannhäuser was completely baffled. The audience was puzzled. The reception was lukewarm. Wagner began revisions at once. The second performance played to a near empty house. In 1859, Wagner offered ""Tannhäuser"" to the Paris Opéra. They wanted it sung in French. They also wanted a ballet in the second act. This so the Jockey Club had time to finish dinner and arrive at the Opéra just in time to ogle the dancers. Wagner refused to move the ballet from the first act to the second act. There were complaints. Jockey Club members interrupted the performance whenever possible. It was a disaster."
"The opera disappeared from the French stage for 34 years. A few years after the Jockey Club incident, Wagner began revising the Paris version. He produced a sophisticated sound version that was superior to the first draft. Though there are several set pieces in the opera, the opera is closer to Wagner's vision of complete independence from such set pieces. ""Tannhäuser"" is on the threshold of the leitmotif, and the diminishing of the sound power of the orchestra in favor of the sung word."
Sources.
"Wagner's sources for the opera are spread over 600 year time span. In 1391, and again at the beginning of the 15th century, tales were in circulation about a paradise within a German mountain and a traveler who idles with a Sybil before heading to Rome for the Pope's forgiveness. The ""Song of Tannhäuser"" of 1515 combines moralizing with the adventures of an historical Minnesinger named Danhuser, Tanhuser, or Tannenhauser. This Minnesinger's songs told of erotic love and its opposite, holy love."
"Wagner was an insatiable reader, always on the alert for material that could be adapted to an opera. For ""Tannhäuser"", he combined elements not only from traditional tales but material from C. J. L. Lukas's ""Essay"" (1838) on the character of Tannhäuser and Ludwig Tieck's ""Faithful Eckart"" (1799). Ludwig Bechstein's ""Thuringian Legends"" (1835) included the story of the song contest. Wagner was familiar with the song contest through E. T. A. Hoffmann's ""Serapion Brothers"", Friedrich de la Motte-Fouque's drama ""The Singers Dispute in the Wartburg"" (1828), and Wagensil's ""Nuremberg Chronicle""."""
Story of the opera.
"The story is about the struggle between sacred love and profane love, and redemption (salvation) through love. The story is based on the historical character of Tannhäuser, about whom very little is known except the myths about him. It is also about the myth of Venus, but it also deals with the medieval Minnesinger (minstrel). Half of the opera takes place in a historical setting, and half takes place in the mythological Venusberg."
Criticism.
"The critics took Wagner to task for his historical inaccuracies. First, the real Tannhauser was only a boy at the supposed time of the song contest. Secondly, they regarded Wagner's Elisabeth with scorn: Wagner had made the character an amalgamation of several historical women."
Production.
"Cuts to the original were made almost immediately because the singers were not capable of understanding and thus acting their roles. The Prelude to Act 3 was cut from 155 bars to 92. In the original final scene, neither Elisabeth or Venus appeared on stage. The audience was puzzled."
"The original final scene was retained until the 13th performance in 1847. Wagner then recast the final pages to make Venus visible on stage. The Venusberg did not appear however. This new ending disturbed the audience because they were used to the older version. Wagner had also cut the pilgrim's chorus, further antagonizing the audience. Another version was made restoring the chorus."
Early productions.
"The first performance outside Dresden occurred at Weimar. This production demonstrated to small theaters that they could stage the opera. Other productions took place in Schwerin, Breslau, Prague, Wiesbaden, and other small houses. The opera played in New York in 1859. It played in London (in Italian) in 1876. In Vienna, Johann Strauss performed excerpts in 1853. The first Austrian staging occurred at Graz in 1854. Vienna mounted the opera in 1857. The opera was performed at the Vienna court opera in 1875. In 1860, the Paris Opera wanted the work in a revised version in French. Wagner made extensive revisions for Paris."

"New York State Route 9G (NY 9G) is a road in Dutchess County, New York, United States. It starts at US 9 in Poughkeepsie and follows the Hudson River as it goes north. It crosses Route 9 just north of Rhinebeck and ends in Hudson."
Kennedy Center Honors
"Every year, the Kennedy Center gives its Kennedy Center Honors to artists. These artists have contributed to American culture. Most of these artists were performers, such as actors, dancers, and musicians. Some of these artists were movie directors, play writers, and songwriters. Most of the recipients have been American. The President of the United States usually attends the awards ceremony. The Honors are given in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center Opera House."
"From 1978 until 2002, the ceremony was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Since 2003, it has been hosted by Caroline Kennedy."

Mandalay in writing.
There are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.
"Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called ""Mandalay."" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: ""on the road to Mandalay."""
"In 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song ""On the Road to Mandalay."" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it ""Come Fly with Me""."
"George Orwell wrote a novel called ""Burmese Days"". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are ""A Hanging"" (1931) and ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936)."
Twin towns.
Mandalay has three twin towns:
Act of Congress
"An Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a ""Congress,"" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days."
Bills.
"Senators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated."
"A bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered ""dead"". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures."
Resolutions.
"In addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions."
Simple resolutions.
"These are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated ""H.Res."" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated ""S. Res."" followed by a number."
Joint resolutions.
"A joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated ""H.J.Res."" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated ""S.J.Res."", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills."
Concurrent resolutions.
"Concurrent resolutions start with either ""S.Con.Res."" (Senate) or ""H.Con.Res."" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law."
Jeff Weaver (political staffer)
"Jeffrey ""Jeff"" P. Weaver (born 1966) is an American political adviser. He was the campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver served as the campaign manager during Bernie Sanders' successful Senate run in 2006. Weaver also served as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices."
"Weaver was born in St. Albans, Vermont. He studied at Boston University, the University of Vermont, and Georgetown University."
Asta Nielsen
"Asta Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent movie actress. She was very popular in the 1910s. She was one of the first international movie stars. Nielsen was in 74 movies. 70 were in Germany where she was known simply as ""Die Asta"" (""The Asta""). She had large dark eyes, a face like a mask and a figure like a boy. Nielsen most often played strong and passionate women trapped by tragic lives. Her performances were erotic so Nielsen's movies were heavily censored in the United States. Therefore, she was not very famous there. Nielsen started her own movie studio in Berlin in the 1920s. She went back to Denmark in 1937 after Nazism became a problem. Later in life, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author."
F. Lee Bailey
"Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (June 10, 1933 – June 3, 2021) was an American criminal-defense lawyer. Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He worked in Massachusetts and Florida."
"The construction of this cultural hall began in 1903. The chief builder was J. Kreml from Litomysl. The foundation stone was laid on April 4, 1903. Smetana’s house is named after a famous composer Bedřich Smetana. He was born in Litomyšl in 1824. Smetana’s house is a theater and a cultural centre. Smetana’s house consists of a big auditorium, a small auditorium and a lounge. Its style is the Art Nouveau. You can visit concerts, balls and theatre performances there."
Regional Museum.
"The building of the museum was originally the piaristic grammar school. Alois Jirásek taught there. It is situated next to the Piaristic Church and opposite the castle. There was a big reconstruction of the building from 2012 to 2014. Today you can visit a new interactive display show of the history of the town, smaller displays of the Cabinet ancient history or Guild of shooters to target. Other contemporary exhibitions often take place there."
Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral college, as if it were a state. The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961."
"According to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors. Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election."
Background.
"When the Constitution was ratified, the nation's capital was New York City. However, Article one, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution states:"
"Selecting the site for the new capital was a political compromise. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury and bankers, mainly from the northeast, got the Bank of the United States located in Philadelphia. In exchange, a special District of Columbia would be located on the Potomac River, closer to the southern states and controlled by Congress."
"Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790 on a site selected by George Washington. He appointed three commissioners to prepare the city for the new government, scheduled for 1800. While this was taking place, from 1790 until 1800, the capital was Philadelphia."
"In 1800, as planned, the District of Columbia became the nation's capital. At the time the population was only about 5,000 residents. As a district and federal territory, the population did not have a local or state government. They also could not vote in federal elections."
"Passed by Congress on June 17, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961, Amendment XXIII, for the purposes of the Electoral College, treats the District of Columbia the same as if it were a state. This gives the citizens of the District the right to vote in presidential elections. The Amendment does not make the district a state, it gives the residents the same number of electors the same number as if it were a state. But, per the amendment, no more than the smallest state. The Amendment does not give district citizens any representation in Congress. Congress continues to govern the district."
Political impact.
"While the District of Columbia is considered politically neutral at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party since. African-Americans have voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the 1970 census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump. As a result, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964. However, the District's electoral votes have yet to prove decisive in a presidential election. The smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment's ratification was the 56 vote majority achieved by Jimmy Carter in 1976."

Wolf
"The wolf (""Canis lupus"") is a mammal of the order Carnivora. It is sometimes called timber wolf or grey wolf."
"It is the ancestor of the domestic dog. A recent study found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtze River in China."
"There are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, ""Canis lupus"" is IUCN graded as 'least concern'."
Appearance.
Adult wolves are usually in length from nose to tail depending on the subspecies. Wolves living in the far north tend to be larger than those living further south. As adults they may weigh typically between . The heaviest wolf recorded weighed .
"The wolf has a long muzzle, short ears, long legs, and a long bushy tail."
"Wolves usually measure at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the under-layer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, taupe, brown, and black."
Life.
"Wolves live in groups called ""packs"". They are pack hunters. The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. The leaders are called the parent (breeding) male and the parent (breeding) female. Their territory is marked by scent and howling; they will fight any intruders. Young wolves are called 'pups' or 'whelps'. Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter."
Wolves make a noise called a howl. They howl to communicate with each other from long distances and to mark the edges of their territory. Wolves have a complicated body language.
Wolves can run very fast and far. A wolf can run in a day.
Grey wolves can live six to eight years in the wild. They can live in captivity for up to 17 years.
Diet.
"Wolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size hoofed animals (unguligrades), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals."
"Wolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat."
Habitat.
"Wolves are found in Europe, Asia and North America. They can live in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, grasslands and sometimes around towns and cities."
Arctic wolf.
"The Arctic wolf may be a subspecies of the grey wolf. They live in the Canadian part of the Arctic Circle, as well as Greenland and Iceland."
"The habitat of Arctic wolves is very hostile. Not much is known about their lifestyle. They are more friendly than other wolves, but they can still be very aggressive."
"Their winter fur is highly resistant to the cold. Wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. Since about 1930, the skull of many Arctic wolves has become smaller. This might be because of hybridization between wolves and dogs. They are tall when they're adults. Adult arctic wolves weigh about . Arctic wolves live in a group of 7-20 wolves. They may live up to 5–10 years in the wild. They can live for 14 years if they are well cared for in a zoo."
Wolves and humans.
"Even though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets: they are a close relative of the wolf."
"A few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey."
Extinction in Britain.
Wolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting. The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands. There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen.
"Within the past ten years, there have been studies that are in favour of allowing new wolves to come and live in the English countryside and Scottish Highlands again. One study was in 2007. Researchers from Norway, Britain, and Imperial College London decided that wolves would help add back plants and birds that now are eaten by deer. The wolves would keep the deer population lower. People were generally positive, but farmers living in rural areas wanted to be paid for livestock that were killed by the wolves."

Chinese language
The Chinese language is the group of languages used by Chinese people in China and elsewhere. It forms part of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
"Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue and Min. These are not mutually intelligible and many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages."
"'Chinese' can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use the same writing system. Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing. Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the Soviet Union, using one official language so people can understand each other. The Standard Chinese language is referred to as Mandarin in English, ""Pǔtōnghuà"" or ""common to everybody speech"" in mainland China and ""Guóyǔ"" or ""language of the whole country"" in Taiwan. All official documents in Pinyin are written in Mandarin and Mandarin is taught all over China. It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries."
"Chinese is used by the Han people in China and other ethnic groups in China who are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Many people in autonomous regions of China speak other languages. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. They also give ""some"" indication of pronunciation, but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese. Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, people in places far from each other say them differently, just as ""1, 2, 3"" can be read differently in different languages."
"Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu Pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters."
All the Chinese languages (or dialects) use tones. This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear.
Different languages or dialects of Chinese.
"The Chinese language is like a big tree. The base of the tree started thousands of years ago. It now has several main limbs. Some people call ""just a branch"" what other people call a main limb, so you can say there are six or seven main limbs. Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain, the United States, Australia, India, and so forth. Just as the Romance languages all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin, the Chinese languages all have some common source, so they keep many common things among them."
Here are the main seven main groups of languages/dialects of Chinese by size:
Traditional and simplified characters.
"In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. The Japanese language uses them even more often. These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji."
"A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. However, people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper—but they will have to guess some less-used words."
Examples.
"Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it."
"The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters."
"Before 1956, Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters. At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all. The government of the People's Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand. They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write. Today, many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters."
Zero
"Zero (0) is a special number. If there are zero things, then there is nothing at all. For example, if a person has zero hats, that means they do not have any hats."
Symbol.
"The symbol for the number zero is ""0"". It is the additive identity of common numbers. This means that if a number is added to 0, then that number would remain unchanged."
Math with zero.
3 + 0 = 3
3 − 0 = 3
0 − 3 = −3
"While the movie is widely said to be a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the movie was first released."
Awards and honors.
"In the scene where Lamarr talks to his band of bad guys, he says, ""You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!"" Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nomination. The movie did receive three other Academy Awards nominations in 1974: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Madeline Kahn, Best Film Editing, and Best Music, Original Song. The movie also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay."
"The movie won the Writers Guild of America Award for ""Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen"" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger."
"In 2006, ""Blazing Saddles"" was chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry."
Alexander Rybak
"Alexander Rybak (13 May 1986) is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer, composer and violinist. He was born in Minsk, Belarusian SSR. He moved to Norway when he was four. He is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Fairytale"" for Norway. Rybak went to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo to perform his winning entry from the previous year."
Pika
"A pika is a small mammal related to the hare and the rabbit (lagomorph). Pikas are also known as rock rabbits or coneys. Pikas have short limbs, a round body, an even coat of fur, round ears, and no external tail."
"There are 37 different species of pika. Most pikas live in colder climates, on rocky mountain slopes. Pikas need cold temperatures to live, and can die if exposed to temperatures above . They live in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. They are active during the day or twilight. Pikas do not hibernate. Because they do not hibernate, during the summer they gather food for winter. They collect hay, which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. Predators, like ferrets, and large birds often use these disputes to catch pikas."
"Pikas are herbivores and eat many kinds of plants, such as grasses, sedges, moss, and lichens."
Pikas in Eurasia often live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. Pikas in North America are asocial outside of breeding season.
Pikachu from Pokemon is based off this animal.
Two-source hypothesis
"The Two-source hypothesis is a hypothesis that was made in the 19th century. It tries to explain what is called the synoptic problem in Christian theology. This problem is that certain parts of the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke have texts that are very similar. The hypothesis claims that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written based on the gospel of Mark, and lost source text, called Q. The Q is for German ""Quelle"", and means source. The lost document was likely a collection of Jesus' sayings, very probably written in Ancient Greek. The hypothesis is widely accepted among Christian scholars."
Problems.
There are two major problems with this hypothesis:
Favicon
A favicon is small image (known as an icon) that is used to identify a website or webpage.
"This type of icon (also known as a favorite icon or favorites icon) is usually a square image that is only 16 pixels in height and 16 pixels in width. However, modern browsers, especially those installed on smartphones, can display bigger favicons that are 32 pixels or 64 pixels in size. And when a favicon is included in a webpage it can be seen next to a browser's address bar, inside a browser's tab or in the browser's Favorites' or Bookmarks' list."
Henry Rollins
"Henry Rollins (born February 13, 1961 in Washington D.C.) is an American singer, writer and actor. After a few wild years in the punk rock band Black Flag, he started his own metal band, the Rollins Band. Rollins is now a solo artist. He often tours in many countries performing spoken-word concerts."
Tay-Sachs disease
Tay-Sachs disease (also called Tray-Sachs syndrome) is a disease that causes problems with the metabolism of fat. Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A.
"Tay-Sachs is a genetic disease. It happens when Chromosome 15 has a genetic problem. The problem is caused by a defective HEXA gene. It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In the 1800’s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5."
"Infants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay–Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the ""startle response"". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease."
"That was the Ford Mustang in 2015 but in 2016, Shelby decided to boost the 6th generation Mustang by creating the all new Shelby GT350R which had a 5.2 litre V8 with 526hp at 7500RPM. This was a great increase in performance since the 2015 Mustang. It also included many carbon fibre pieces that were put into the car to reduce its weight. The stock rims in fact were the first ever carbon fibre rims created by NASA, a space station in the USA. The GT350R also had a mounted carbon fibre spoiler and quad exhaust pipes. The same Mustang will be sold in America until 2018, where Ford is rumoured to give us a brand new facelifted Mustang..."
"Beginning with the 2021 model year, Ford also uses the Mustang name on a new, large electric crossover model called the Mach-E."
"The 2021 Mustang Mach-E is Ford's first all-electric crossover, and it was designed and named after the company's iconic pony car. The Mach-E also pays homage to the ""Mach 1"" moniker that has been used on high-performance Mustangs of old. Ford said it went with the name because it needed the electrified crossover to be as desirable as a Tesla to usher in its new era of electric vehicles. It's expected to provide 300 miles of driving range when paired with the extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive."
Red Hat Linux
"Red Hat Linux is a discontinued Linux operating system, replaced by RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)."
"Red Hat made it public in the past and it was used by many Linux users. The last publicly released version was Red Hat Linux 9 in April, 2003. Red Hat then decided to discontinue a future release of Red Hat Linux and started the paid ""Red Hat Enterprise Linux"" instead. There are some redistributions of RHEL, though such as CentOS which are free and come without Red Hat's branding, logos etc. due to trademark restrictions."
Red Hat Linux 7.3 version is still widely used around the world for servers and workstations.
"Around 2005, The Red Hat company released their system as Fedora Core, intended to be a test platform for new technologies. It is now called just 'Fedora' and its present release acts as a base for the next release of RHEL."
Sacavém
"Sacavém is a city in Portugal, near the capital Lisbon. There is about eighteen hundred people living there. Sacavém is on the border of the River Tagus. It confines with the parishes of ""Bobadela"", ""Camarate"", ""Moscavide"", ""Portela"", ""Prior Velho"" and ""Unhos""."
Sacavém is very well known for its ceramics.
Shooter
A shooter is a kind of video game. The aim of the game is to beat enemies by shooting (or otherwise killing) them. The enemies shoot back.
"Many of the oldest computer games were shooters; the first video game ever made was a shooter called ""Computer Space"". And one of the first games that many people played was a shooter called ""Space Invaders""."
"There are lots of different kinds of shooter. Now many people like first-person shooters. But there are other kinds too. In Japan many people play shooters where the enemies fire lots of bullets. The bullets make beautiful patterns on the screen. This kind of shooter is called a ""barrage shooter, bullet hell game"" or a ""curtain fire shooter"". It is also called by the Japanese name, ""danmaku"". One of these games is Touhou. Another that combines bullet hell elements with an RPG is Undertale."
Sushi
is a traditional food that is from Japan.
"The word ""Sushi"" comes from the Japanese word meaning vinegar, and "", meaning rice."
"Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called . The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called ."
"Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari (Japanese pickled ginger slices) must be eaten with chopsticks."
"There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is : fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of ""sumeshi"". Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the ""sumeshi"", such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, , consists of ""sumeshi"" rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, ""makizushi"" is more popular than ""nigirizushi"". Another type is known as or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the ""nori"" wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of ""sumeshi"", fish, and vegetables."
"Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. ""Gari"" (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser."
"In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in ""conveyor-belt shops"" called ""kaiten zushi"" (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well."
History.
"Sushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of preserving fish in fermented rice. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice ""and"" the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture."
"The origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called ""narezushi"". The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice."
What is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay.
"By the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people had immigrated there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles."
"The United States has a history in intelligence services dating back to its origins. During the American Revolution, George Washington and other Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and Patrick Henry used espionage networks."
"The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has been Gina Haspel since April 26, 2018."
"The CIA is made up of four groups, which do different things. Its goal is to protect the US people. Many people feel that the CIA does more bad than good. Others people that the CIA does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the United States. Others think those secrets should remain secret. American law makes it illegal for the CIA and other agencies to kill foreign leaders."
"In 1992, Saddam Hussein tried to kill US President George H.W. Bush, who used to be director of the CIA, during a visit to Kuwait. The assassination plot failed. In revenge, President Bill Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the Iraqi equivalent to the CIA. That occurred at night and so only the cleaners were killed, not those who had planned the assassination."
"CIA has many clandestine, or secret, operations. Some CIA employees have been killed during their work. Their names are on a CIA memorial with a star for them, but some of the names are still secret. The number of stars is deliberately inaccurate."
"The CIA also uses open sources to gather information. Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasts to learn information, which can be pieced together to make a conclusion."
"The CIA used to report to the President. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a reorganization made the CIA and other intelligence agencies report to a Director of National Intelligence."
"The CIA has been featured in many television and film productions, including the American television show ""The Agency,"" the American television mini-series ""The Company,"" the film ""Spy Game"" that stars Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, ""Night Flight to Moscow"" that stars Yul Brenner, ""Scorpio"" that stars Burt Lancaster, ""Clear and Present Danger"" that stars Harrison Ford; ""Ice Station Zebra,"" and several James Bond films that featured the CIA agent Felix Leiter."

Company (disambiguation)
The word company has several meanings:
Rio de Janeiro
"Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil. It is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Until April 21, 1960 it was the capital city of Brazil. According to the 2000 Census, the city had 5,473,909 people, and an area of over 1,000 km2. In 2008 Eduardo Paes became Mayor. The city was started in 1565."
"Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach, Sugar Loaf Mountain (in Portuguese, ""Pão de Açúcar""), the statue of Christ the Redeemer (in Portuguese, ""Cristo Redentor""), a harbor on Guanabara Bay, and Tom Jobim Airport are in Rio de Janeiro. It has much commerce and many industries, especially textiles, food, chemicals, and metallurgy. Most of these industries are in the northern and western suburbs of the city. Rio de Janeiro also has a small rural area, near the suburb of Campo Grande, where fruits and vegetables are grown."
"Other cities near Rio de Janeiro, like Duque de Caxias, Nova Iguaçu, Queimados and São Gonçalo, that form the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, also have a lot of industries and population."
"The city is 420 kilometers (about 261 miles) away from São Paulo, the biggest city in South America. The cities of Rio and São Paulo are linked by the Presidente Dutra Highway (also known as ""Via Dutra""). The region crossed by the Presidente Dutra Highway has been an important industrial zone since the 1950s."
"In the city of Rio de Janeiro lies Tijuca National Park, created in 1961. This park contains some 33 km2, between the northern and the southern parts of the city. The district (in Portuguese, ""bairro"") of Santa Tereza can be reached by taking an electric tram (in Portuguese, ""bonde"") from central Rio de Janeiro (near ""Largo da Carioca"" subway station), crossing over the ""Arcos da Lapa"", an aqueduct built during the colonial period to provide water to the city."
The city hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 2016.
"The season lasts 18 weeks. Each team plays 17 games and has one week off. This week of rest is called a ""bye week""."
NFL playoffs.
"At the end of the regular season, the winners of each division and the next three best teams in each conference play in a tournament. The NFC's champion and The AFC's champion play the NFL's final game, the Super Bowl. The event is often treated as a National holiday as many stores close for the event. The day of the event is commonly known nationwide as Super Bowl Sunday."

Notes
The Ugly Duckling
"""The Ugly Duckling"" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Andersen lavished great care on this story, spending a year perfecting it. It was first published in 1844 with ""The Angel"", ""The Sweethearts"", and ""The Nightingale"" in ""New Fairy Tales"". The critics liked these stories. Andersen considered the story ""a reflection of my own life."" The moral of the tale: ""it does not matter if you were born in a duck yard if you have lain in a swan's egg."" The tale has been adapted to various media such as animated movies."
Story.
"A mother duck hatches six pretty little ducklings. A seventh bird is hatched. He is homely. The other ducks abuse him. He runs away. He is given a home by an old woman. Her cat and hen do not like him. He runs away again. Winter comes and a kind farmer gives him a home. The little bird almost dies. Spring comes. The ""ugly duckling"" has grown into a beautiful swan. The other swans welcome him as their own. They bow to him. He is happy for the first time in his life."
General relativity
"General relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is matter, energy, and momentum resulting in what we perceive as gravity. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations. In general relativity, gravity has no force as Newton put forward. According to Einstein it is a curvature that warps not only space, but also time. (Time dilation)"
Idea.
"A central idea in general relativity is the ""principle of equivalence."" An example is that two people, one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth, and the other in an elevator in outer space but accelerating upwards at the speed of 9.8 m/s2 (every second the object picks up speed of 9.8 m/s), will each observe the same behavior of an object they drop from their hands. The object will accelerate to the floor at 9.8 m/s2 in either case, making it impossible for either to distinguish whether or not they are at rest in a gravitational field or accelerating upward creating the same effect as gravity would on Earth. Other versions of this type of ""thought experiment"" were used to show that light would curve in an accelerating frame of reference (perspective). There are several forms of the equivalence principle. These include: Newton's equivalence principle, the weak equivalence principle, the gravitational weak equivalence principle, Einstein's equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle."
"The Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime, and one of the other objects in the valley (i.e, spacetime) is the Earth. The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun (or ball) because it is moving too fast. The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force. This second force is called the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways. This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase. Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time, it stays at about the same distance. This is also how the Moon orbits the earth. In this second case, Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object. However, this valley example to demonstrate Gravity is insufficient because spacetime fabric is actually Four Dimensional, whereas valley's example implies two dimensional spacetime. Sun and other objects with mass curves four dimensional spacetime fabric. Valley example is just analogy and not 100% reality."
Predictions.
General relativity has predicted many things which were later seen. These include:
Rutland
"Rutland is the smallest county of England. It is surrounded by the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire."
The main towns of Rutland are Oakham and Uppingham.
"In the mid-1970s, it was the inspiration for Eric Idle's TV show, Rutland Weekend Television."
Adlai Stevenson I
"Adlai Ewing Stevenson (October 23, 1835 – June 14, 1914) was an American politician. He was vice president of the United States under Grover Cleveland, and ran for President and several other political offices, but lost. He was also first assistant Postmaster General and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois, as well. His grandson of the same name also was a notable politician and writer. Another grandson, McLean Stevenson was an actor. His other grandson was Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III."
"Toledo, Ohio"
"Toledo is a city in Ohio, USA. It was named after Toledo, Spain. It is a large industrial city, and has many factories that make things like car parts and glass. In 1835 and 1836, Ohio and Michigan both claimed to own the city and surrounding territory. Michigan gave up its claim and got the Upper Peninsula in exchange. Toledo is about an hour from Detroit, Michigan. The main highways in and out of Toledo are Interstate 75, Interstate 90, and U.S. 24 (Detroit Boulevard, Telegraph Road). It is the 59th largest city in the United States."
Toledo's manufacturing industry concentrates on automobiles and glass.
"Toledo has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
"Since the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains made of just three cells. One cell drills down through the integuments, to make a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and forms a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of ""double fertilisation"" is unique, and is common to all angiosperms."
Evolution of flowers.
"Flowers are modified leaves. They are only present in flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record."
"Early fossils of flowers and flowering plants are known from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous. However, flowers had a much longer history, the extent of which is not yet fully known. There were flowers from the early Jurassic, 50 million years earlier than was previously thought."
"The flowering plants were thought to have evolved from within the gymnosperms. However, the known gymnosperms are a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms. Apparently, the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago. That is about the boundary of the Carboniferous period with the Permian period."
Uses of flowers.
As decoration.
"Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists."
As a name.
"Some parents name their children, most often girls, after a flower. Some common flower names are: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Blossom."
As food.
"People eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion can be made into wine."
"Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named by the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers, such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine, can be used to make tea."
Special meanings.
"Flowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult. Lilies made people think of life. Red roses made people think of love, beauty, and passion. In Britain, Australia and Canada, poppies are worn on special holidays as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars. Daisies made people think of children and innocence."

Square kilometre
"A square kilometer (sometimes written ""km²"") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the ""square meter"". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometer (1000 meters). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example."
One square kilometer is just less than 0.39 square miles.
Judge
A judge is a person who is in control of a court of law.
"The way to become a judge depends on each country. In some countries, judges must work with the law (often as a lawyer) for a number of years before they can ""sit as a judge"" in a courthouse. Judges are supposed to conduct the trial in an open courtroom and impartially."
"In many English speaking countries, judges cannot make some decisions on their own. In these countries, juries are used, but not for all cases. The modern jury trial first developed in mid-12th century England during the reign of Henry II. Today, the details differ between one country and another."
"If there is a jury, the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way. Some courts will have more than one judge. For important decisions about the laws of a country, countries may have a ""supreme court"" or ""high court"" with many (nine or more) judges in it. In the United States, judges on a supreme court are called ""justices"" and are led by a ""Chief Justice""."
"In many countries, judges wear special clothes while being in court. Often this is a black robe or cloak. Supreme or High Court judges often wear a red cloak. Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig. They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die."

North East MRT line
The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.
"The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations."
"This line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track."
All the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line.
Stations.
"The Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast. Construction will begin in 2018, and it is expected to open in 2023."
List of Singapore MRT stations
"The following lists all rail stations of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in Singapore, with underground stations listed in ""italics"". There are 151 stations in operation. Many more are in various stages of planning and construction (as shown in the latest system map)."
At bat
"In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is used for certain statistics. These statistics include batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage. It is a more narrow definition of a plate appearance. A batter starts with an at bat every time he faces a pitcher; however, the batter gets ""no time at bat"" in the following cases:"
Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of Major League Baseball defines an at bat as:
"""Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction..."""
Examples.
An at bat is counted when:
Cal Ripken Jr.
"Calvin Edwin ""Cal"" Ripken, Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed ""Iron Man"", is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played his whole 21-year baseball career for the Baltimore Orioles (1981–2001)."
"Ripken is perhaps best known for breaking New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. The record had been called too hard to break. He beat the 56-year-old record when he played in his 2,131st straight game on September 6, 1995 between the Orioles and the California Angels in front of a sold-out crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Ripken hit a home run in the game the night before that tied Gehrig's record and another home run in his 2,131st game. Fans later voted this game as Major League Baseball's ""Most Memorable Moment"" in MLB history. Ripken played in an 501 more straight games over the next three years. His streak ended at 2,632 games when he removed his name from the lineup for the final Orioles home game of the 1998 season. His record 2,632 straight games lasted over seventeen seasons, from May 30, 1982 to September 20, 1998."
"A 19-time All-Star and member of the 3000 hit club, Ripken is considered one of the best shortstops and third basemen to ever play the game. At 6' 4"" (1.93 m), 225 lbs. (102.27 kg), he led the way for taller, larger shortstops to be successful in that position. When voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he was a first ballot inductee with the third highest voting percentage (98.53%) in Hall of Fame history, behind Tom Seaver (98.84%) and Nolan Ryan (98.79%)."
"He is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc. The company's goal is to grow the love of baseball from a more grassroots level. Established in 2001, Ripken Baseball represents Cal and his brother Bill's business and philanthropy dealings and focuses on several subsidiaries: Ripken Management and Design, Youth Camps and Clinics, Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation, Ripken Professional Baseball, with three minor-league teams—the Aberdeen IronBirds (affiliated with the Orioles); the Augusta GreenJackets (affiliated with the San Francisco Giants); and the Charlotte Stone Crabs (affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays)—and Ironclad Authentics."

2012 Arkansas Democratic presidential primary
"The 2012 Arkansas Democratic presidential primary was held on May 22 2012. The then current US president Barack Obama won the primary against Tennessee attorney and candidate who had a record of losing John Wolfe Jr, who got nearly 42% of the vote, which many people didn't think would happen. All 47 voters to decide the winner of the primary were given to, and said they would vote for Barack Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. While John Wolfe Jr. was allowed 19 delegates to the convention because of how he had done in Arkansas, state party officials said Wolfe missed two paperwork filing deadlines related to the voters for the convention process, therefore he was not allowed to be given them. Wolfe started legal proceedings to have voters in the primary in his name allowed. Eight other delegates who didn't announce who they'd vote for, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well."

Frances Burney
"Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840) was an English novelist, diarist and playwright. She was also known as Fanny Burney. After her marriage, she was known as Madame d’Arblay. She was born in King's Lynn, England. She was born to musician Dr Charles Burney (1726 – 1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725 – 62). She mostly taught herself. She began writing what she called her ""scribblings"" when she was ten. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was published in 1778. This novel made her very famous. ""Cecilia"" came out in 1782. It was an even greater critical success. Her major novels, ""Evelina"", ""Cecilia"", and ""Camilla"" are about a young girl. The girls are clever and beautiful, but does not have a lot of experience. The girl goes out into the world and grows in character. Her books were liked by Jane Austen. In 1786, she became Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte. She wrote many journals and letters. Her journals and letters have interested historians. In 1793, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. They had a son in 1794. His name was Alexander. He was their only son. While living in France from 1802 to 1812, Burney wrote ""The Wanderer"". It was a novel about the French Revolution. It was published in 1814. Her last published work was the ""Memoirs of Doctor Burney"" (1832). She died in London in 6 January 1840. She was buried in Bath near her husband and son."
Family life.
"On 13 June 1752, Frances Burney was born in King's Lynn. She was baptized on the 7th of July. Her older brothers and sisters were Ester (Hetty) (1749 – 1832) and James (1750 – 1821). Her younger brothers and sisters were Susanna Elizabeth (1755-1800), Charles (1757-1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761 – 1838). Susanna Elizabeth became Frances Burney's close friend. James Burney became an admiral. He sailed with Captain James Cook on his second and third trips. The younger Charles Burney was a scholar. Her younger half-sister, Sarah Burney (1772 – 1844), also became a novelist. She published five works that she wrote herself. Esther Sleepe Burney also had two boys who died at birth."
First mother.
"Esther Sleepe Burney was three years older than Charles Burney. She had her oldest daughter, Esther, with Charles before they married. Frances Burney kept this as a ""family secret"". She even said nothing about the date of her father's marriage. Also, she did not say when his children were born in the ""Memoirs"". Some people have thought that she hid the dates to make everyone believe she published ""Evelina"" when 17."
"Her mother suddenly became sick. She took a trip to Bath and Bristol Hot Wells. This is where main character in ""Evelina"" go to try to become healthy again. However, she did not get better. The sickness was thought to be tuberculosis. It is also possible that it was cancer. In 1760, her mother, Esther Sleepe Burney, died. She was described by historians as a gentle woman of ""warmth and intelligence"". It is possible that Esther Burney's French birth influenced Burney's writing. One example is the conflicts between Madame Duval and Captain Mirvan in ""Evelina"". It may also have been one reason for her love of and marriage to Alexandre D'Arblay. Fanny was very shocked and sad when she heard that her mother was dead. Her neighbor, Mrs. Pringle, commented. She later said, ""...she never saw such affliction"" and that Fanny would ""take no comfort--&amp; was almost killed with [""sic""] Crying"". Her father, Charles Burney, was also very unhappy. He comforted himself with writing sad poems about his wife."
Father.
"Her father was respected by many people as a musician. He was also well-educated. He wished to show that a musician could be a gentleman. Frances Burney often saw many opera singers, dancers, musicians, and actors (like actors Garrick or Christopher Smart), that spoke in many kinds of languages. She mentioned him in ""Evelina"": ""Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so universally (everywhere) admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer...every look ""speaks""!...I am afraid you will think me mad (crazy), so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him."" She also saw more of the world than most ""young ladies"" could. She wrote down many rude things people said in her diaries. Traveller Richard Twiss once embarrassed the family by talking about improper things. He said that an immodest book, ""The Dictionary of Love"", was very good. After Twiss left, Burney wrote in her Diary, 'Even my gentle &amp; candid (truthful) Father says that ""he has quite mistaken the Thing,"" &amp; that he will never see a ""Table Cloth"" in his House again'."
"Some people have said that Burney may have been shy because of her father. People said that Mr. Burney's only fault was ""obsequiousness"" (too much serving to men). Frances never openly criticized her father. She even carefully destroyed everything bad about him. In her ""Memoirs"", she wrote that her father had no faults. However, she wrote explanations and excuses for things her father thought were right."
Second mother.
"In October 1767, her father married a rich widow. Her name was Elizabeth Allen. She already had three sons. The Burney children did not like their stepmother. Hester, Frances's older sister, married her cousin. His name was Charles Rosseau Burney. He was a musician. She married him in September 1770. She probably did this to leave her home. Because of this, Frances lost a sister who was like another mother. The Burney children did a ""secret war"" with Mrs. Allen. They called her ""Mrs. Precious"", ""Madam"", and ""the Lady"". A letter from Frances Burney to her sister Hester said, ""The excuse to be ""fudged"" up (made up, lied) for the purpose, I leave to your own ingenuity."" Although at this time Frances was 25 years old, she had to find an excuse to visit her married sister. Even their old friend, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp, joined in with mocking Mrs. Elizabeth Allen."
Education.
"Her father educated her sisters Esther and Susanna much more than Frances Burney. When she was eight, she still had not learned the alphabet. She was also so shy that visitors at her father's house called her the ""old lady"". Some scholars think she might have had a kind of dyslexia. Her brother used to play tricks on her by pretending to teach her to read and giving her a book upside-down. She did not find out that it was actually upside down and tried to read it. People said that ""the little dunce"" should be whipped. However, Esther Sleepe Burney always replied that ""she had no fears about Fanny"". Her sister Susanna said that Fanny has ""sense, sensibility, and bashfulness (shyness)"". She also added, ""I am afraid...that my sister Fanny is too reserved""."
"In 1763 or 1764, Samuel ""Daddy"" Crisp became close to the Burney family. He helped Frances write by asking for many journal-letters from her about her family and her life. He influenced her writing very much."
Works.
"Frances Burney d'Arblay made a new kind of English novel, recording things that happened from George III's madness to what happened after the Battle of Waterloo. She also wrote comedies that had a great influence on many writers to come. For example, Jane Austen found both the theme and the title for ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the last chapter of Frances Burney's novel ""Cecilia"". William Makepeace Thackeray, the writer of Vanity Fair, was also influenced by Burney. Her first novel, ""Evelina"", was a new kind of fiction in English. It was a fiction where women in society were shown in realistic, modern ways - the novel of manners. ""She showed the manners and morals of polite society with a relish (liking) for the ridiculous (funny) and a respect for the conventional (traditional)"".(""Norton Anthology of Literature by Women"", p. 242) Burney was the first woman to make the writing of novels ""respectable"". Her second novel, ""Cecilia"", published in 1782, was an even greater critical success. Her third novel, ""Camilla"", was very popular; the sale was ""4 times that of ""Evelina"", &amp; nearly double that of ""Cecilia""""."

Grebe
A grebe is a medium sized bird. They are in the family Podicipedidae. There are 22 species of grebe.
"Description, color and shape."
"Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the Little Grebe are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is webbed feet which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water."
"Hare Krishna is a mantra. It is also known as Maha Mantra. The mantra was made well known even outside Hinduism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The mantra can be found in many Hinduist traditions in India. Those who believe in it think that when the mantra is heard, spoken, used for meditation or sung this can lead to a higher state of consciousness. According to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, this higher consciousness takes the form of pure love of God (Krishna). The mantra is contained in the texts of Hinduism known as the Upanishads, which are considered by some scholars to have roots in the Vedic past."

Abdominal compartment syndrome
"Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder)."
"This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure."
"An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen."
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

Bogotá bag
"A Bogotá bag is a sterile plastic bag used to temporarily close incisions in the abdomen. It is generally a sterilized, 3 liter urological irrigation fluid bag, that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. It is called a 'Bogotá bag' because it was first used by Oswaldo Borraez, a doctor in Bogotá, Colombia."
Similar movies.
"""The Magnificent Seven"" was an American movie Western with a similar story. This is called a remake."
"The movie was also adapted into an Japanese anime series in 2004 by GONZO, entitled Samurai 7. The anime series takes a more futuristic and fantasy take at the original story, replacing robots for thieves and bestowing superhuman abilities to the 7 samurais."
Vacuum tube
"A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating."
History.
"Although the vacuum tube was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904, it was Thomas Edison who discovered the ""Edison effect"" in 1883 which states that electricity does not necessarily need a solid material to move through; it can move through gas or vacuums as well."
"John Ambrose Fleming invented the first vacuum tube, the diode, in 1904. Lee De Forest invented the ""audion"" in 1906 (which was improved by others as the triode in 1908) and used in the first telephone amplifiers. Many other kinds were invented for various purposes."
"The transistor became cheaper in the 1960s and was much smaller, worked on lower voltages, and used less power. In addition, unlike vacuum tubes, they were much less likely to be damaged by being dropped and had extremely long life. Eventually, they were also much cheaper than glass vacuum tubes. At this time, most radios, television sets, and amplifiers began using transistors instead. High powered electronics such as broadcasting transmitters were transistorized more slowly. Television receivers continued using the cathode ray tube until the mid-2000s."
Current uses.
"In the 21st century, vacuum tubes are rarely used in common electronic equipment. Many devices today rely on the transistor over the vacuum tube. Some devices that still use the vacuum tube, however, include:"

Bubble tea
"Bubble tea, also called pearl tea or Boba, is a drink which comes from Taichung, Taiwan. It is made by mixing black tea with non-dairy creamer or milk and adding round ""pearl"" tapioca. There are many flavors other than the original one. Green tea can be used instead of black tea. Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca."
"When it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA."
Bubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.
Things that are in bubble tea.
"Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. Ice-mixed versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy softness. There are many varieties of the drink with a huge range of ingredients like coconut or mango. The two most popular types are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca."
The reason for choosing tapioca.
"At first, people made bubble tea without tapioca pearls. But Taiwanese people started to find substances to make the sweetened flavor. Tapioca came from the cassava plant, which is a root of the trees from South America. This plant is now farmed and enjoyed around the world."
Effects on the body from bubble tea.
"Four positive nutrients that tapioca provide are carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds. These include a very low level of fat, cholesterol, and sodium . It is also known as the source of fiber, “good” cholesterol, and protein. But bubble tea has Cyanogen that are transformed in humans and animals after the plant tissue has been weakened. The blood remains oxygenated after it passes through your body and back to the lungs."
Process to make bubble tea.
"Bubble tea is found in Taiwanese restaurants and commonly prepared by shaking ice, milk, tea, and sugar in a cocktail shaker which resulted in a lot of tapioca bubbles. People use the same preparation to make bubble tea, just now with the added Pearls."

Structure.
The school has an English section and a Korean section. The Korean Section uses Korean textbooks. The students there prepare to take the KSAT (Suneung) so they can go to Korean universities. The English section uses English textbooks and follows the Cambridge International Primary Programme.
"KIS has many facilities, like a tennis court, swimming pool, soft-surface playing fields, and a gymnasium. Students use the facilities for physical education classes and activities outside of classes. Higher grade students take a school trip to England."
"There are many special parties during the year. Usually there is one party per month. Some of these parties are Play Day in April, Sports Day in May, Spring Concert in June, Halloween in October, and Fun Tie and Hat Day."
"The students are in four ""house teams""- Cougars, Eagles, Lions and Pandas. Each house has their own chant and their own colour."
Investigation.
In the past the school has had problems with bribery. A person in the cleaning company paid a bribe to a school officer. So the Independent Commission Against Corruption investigated the school and arrested one person. Koreans in Hong Kong were disappointed. They said they lost confidence in the school's management.

2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election
"The Saxony-Anhalt state election was held on 13 March 2016 in the German State of Saxony-Anhalt for the next composition of the Parliament of Saxony-Anhalt. The incumbent Governor is Reiner Haseloff of the CDU, governing with the SPD."
Post-election.
"The only realistic possibility would be a coalition government of the CDU, SPD and the Greens. Together, they would have a 2-seat majority . Other combinations (such as the CDU and The Left or CDU and AfD) are highly unlikely. The stark differences among the parties will make it harder for negotiations to create a coalition."

Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on January 23, 1933, the Twentieth Amendment (Amendment XX) to the United States Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20. It moved the start and end dates for members of Congress from March 1 to January 21. In both cases the start and end time is at noon. It also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect."
Background.
"In the later part of the eighteenth century, when the Constitution was written, travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards. To cross the Atlantic Ocean could take several weeks. Traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the US could take even longer. Communications were mainly by letter or messenger. For these reasons the framers of the Constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages. Four months, the time from the election in November to the swearing-in in March, was necessary at the time."
"By the 1930s, a railroad passenger could cross the country in 3 days. The Post Office had been using airmail since 1918. But vastly improved travel times and communications were not the only reasons behind the Twentieth Amendment. The joint resolution calling for the amendment was sponsored by Republican Senator George William Norris of Nebraska. Called the ""Lame Duck"" Amendment, it acquired this name because Norris wanted to eliminate the lame-duck sessions of Congress where outgoing members still held office and voted on bills for several months before the new members could be sworn in. The bill he wrote applied to both houses of Congress, the offices of President and Vice-President."
Another area the amendment addressed was with the succession of the president if the president-elect died before taking office. It provides for the vice-president elect to become the president-elect and take office on January 20. The amendment also give Congress the power to legislate on other issues dealing with the succession of the president.
Effects of the Twentieth Amendment.
"The sessions of Congress between the election and the beginning of a new term are called ""lame duck"" sessions because members of Congress who were voted out of office still attend and can still vote. Originally the term ""lame duck"" was a financial term meaning those who could not repay a loan. As used in politics, a representative who lost an election was no longer accountable to the voters. As the framers of the Twentieth Amendment saw it, lame duck representatives should not be able to vote since voters had already rejected their views. The Twentieth Amendment only shortened the lame duck period by six weeks. Between 1933 and 2012, 18 lame-duck sessions of Congress have passed laws."

Preamble to the United States Constitution
"This Murrinh-patha mythology is based on a view of life that believes life is ""...a joyous thing with maggots at its centre."". Life is good and caring, but during life's journey, there are many painful sufferings that each person must come to understand and live through as he grows. This is the message being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people reason and meaning in life."
"The following Murrinh-patha myth, for example, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood."
"""A woman, ""Mutjinga"" (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body."""
"Within the myth and in its performance, young children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being who changes into a giant snake. The children are then vomited up before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and benefits of young adults."
Pintupi people.
"The Pintupi peoples from Australia's Gibson Desert region have a mostly 'mythic' form of understanding their identity, All events happen and are explained by the social structures and rules told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology. That is, the structures of society come from the myths, not from their own political actions, decisions or influences of local individuals."
"""The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied."""
"""Current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order."""
"Within this Pintupi view of the world, three long geographical tracks of named places control and guide society. They are interrelated strings of important places named and created by mythic characters on their way through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of stories, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as ""Tingarri"". It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country."

"""Chūgū"" was a term which evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, ""chūgū"" replaced ""kōgō""; and then the titles became interchangeable."
"The numbers of ""kōgō"" varied, but there was only one ""Chūgū"" at a time."

Human chorionic gonadotropin
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy. Some tumors might produce this hormone. From December 6, 2011, the [FDA] (Food and Drug Administration) made illegal selling hCG diet products in pharmacies."
"Controversy about injected hCG for weight loss started marketing campaign for injections of ""homeopathic hCG"" for weight control. The ingredients in these products if prepared from true hCG via homeopathic dilution, will contain either no hCG at all or only small amount of it."
We can measure hCG level with Blood or urine tests. These can be done by pregnancy tests.
"Below is a list of hCG levels during pregnancy. (""LMP"" is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of your last period.) The level of hCG grows over the time during pregnancy."
Giovanni Bellini
"Giovanni Bellini (; c. 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice. His father Jacopo and his brother Gentile were also painters, as was his brother-in-law Mantegna."
"Bellini used a coloristic style exemplified by his use of clear oil paints, deep colors, and detailed shadings. His atmospheric landscapes influenced Venetian painting, particularly the work done by his pupils, Giorgione and Titian."
International marketing
International marketing (IM) or global marketing is a marketing done on international level. The International Marketing is based on strategy created in home country of company and distributed to its other offices/affiliations. In most cases it is international company level (company have offices in different countries) market identification and targeting. International Marketing is very similar to Global marketing.
The main difference will be the fact that Global Marketing is focusing on intercontinental point of view.
The example of International Marketing would be where an English company would like to enter Chinese market. It will be done by either developing marketing strategy in their home country that will be then introduced in new market or they will hire a company to create such a plan.
Differences between marketing and international marketing.
International marketing is developed by many multinational companies on a global level. It is then send to local markets which make changes for their country and starts following new strategy. Such a way of creating marketing strategies ensures that the global brand will be following same strategy and targeting same buyers group.

Sister cities.
The following are the sister cities of Iaşi:
British Rail Class AM1
"Class AM1 was allocated to the prototype AC electric multiple units, converted from fourth-rail DC electric stock in 1952 and used on the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham route. This route had been electrified by the Midland Railway at 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC, but the frequency was changed to 50 Hz in 1953 to test the prototype AM1 stock."
Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)
The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 had its origins in a rise in nationalism in the Balkans as well as in the Russian Empire's goal of recovering territorial losses that it had suffered because of the Crimean War. Tsar Alexander II was fighting against the Ottoman Empire led by Abdul Hamid II .
Kingdom of Romania
"The Kingdom of Romania (or 'Romania' after 1969) was a constitutional monarchy which existed between 13 March 1881 and 30 December 1947, specified by the First (in 1866), and respectively, the Second Constitution of Roumania. Thus, the Kingdom of Romania began with the reign of King Carol I of Romania and later replaced by Michael I of Romania . It's Prime minister was Ion Antonescu who was prime minister from 1940-1944 . He was later executed in 1946 2 year's after the defeat of Nazi Germany,Italy,Hungary,Croatia,Romania,Bulgaria and Japan the Countries in the Axis Powers who were defeated in 1945 ."
"From 1859 to 1877, Romania evolved from a personal union of two vassal principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) to a full-fledged independent kingdom. During 1918-20, at the end of World War I, Transylvania, Eastern Moldavia (Bessarabia), and Bukovina were united with the Kingdom of Romania. In 1940, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja were ceded to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria. In 1947 the last king was compelled to abdicate from throne. Socialist republic ruled by the Romanian Communist Party replaced the monarchy after Joseph Stalin occupied Romania in 1945 ."
Treaty of Trianon
The Treaty of Trianon is the peace treaty signed in 1920 between the Allies and Hungary.
"Hungary lost World War I and so the treaty gave about two thirds of its land and one third of its population to neighboring countries, like Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The partition of Hungary brought irredentism, since many people in the lost lands were Hungarian and wanted to continue being part of Hungary."
"As a result, about 400 000 people from the lost territories sought refuge in Hungary."
"Also, the treaty forced Hungary to pay reparations and to limit the size of its army."
Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye
The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed on 10 September 1919 by the winning Allies and the new Republic of Austria on the other. Austria lost large amounts of territory to the Allies after it lost World War I.
"Like the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, the treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and so the United States did not ratify either of them."
Treaty of Paris (1920)
"The 1920 Treaty of Paris was an act signed by Romania and the Principal Allied Powers of the time (France, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan) whose purpose was the recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia. The treaty however never came into force because Japan failed to ratify it."
Bessarabia
Bessarabia is the word for the area in Eastern Europe between Romania and Ukraine. It shares borders with Dniester River on the east and the Prut River on the west.
"During the 19th century it was sometimes part of Romania and sometimes in the Russian Empire. It was again part of Romania most of the first half of the 20th century. The Soviet Union occupied the region after 1944. Today, most areas of Bessarabia belong to the Republic of Moldova."
Bukovina
Bukovina is a historical region in both Romania and Ukraine. It can be found by the northeastern Carpathian Mountains.
"On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the suggested Constitution. All 30 of the members of its Convention voted for the Constitution."
"On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution. Now that nine states had ratified the Constitution, it became the highest and most important law of the United States. The United States would have a new form of government, based on the ideas set out in the Constitution."
Four states are still left.
"However, four states still had not approved the Constitution. These states were Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. If they did not approve the Constitution, they would not be a part of the new government of the United States."
"The Congress of the Confederation decided that the United States would start using the new Constitution on March 4, 1789. Before that day, Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution. However, when the first United States Congress gathered on March 4 to form the new government, North Carolina and Rhode Island still had not approved the Constitution. After the new Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, though, North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution."
Order of approval.
The Constitution was ratified by the states in this order:
Roberto Perfumo
"Roberto Alfredo Perfumo (3 October 1942 – 10 March 2016) was an Argentine footballer and sports commentator. He was nicknamed ""El Mariscal"". He was thought as one of the best Argentine defenders ever. Perfumo played for Racing, River Plate and Brazilian team Cruzeiro. With the national team, he played the 1966 and 1974 World Cups."
Perfumo died at 73 from a skull injury after falling from a stairway in Buenos Aires on 10 March 2016.
Aldo Ferrer
"Aldo Ferrer (April 15, 1927 – March 8, 2016) was an Argentine economist and policy maker. Ferrer was one of the leading figures of economic nationalism in Argentina. He served as Minister of Economy from 1970 through 1971. He later served as an ambassador to France from Argentine. He served as ambassador from 2011 through 2013. He was born in Buenos Aires."
"Ferrer died in Buenos Aires on March 8, 2016. He was aged 88."
Article Six of the United States Constitution
"Article Six of the United States Constitution says that the Constitution, and any laws or treaties the United States might make, will be the most important laws in the United States. It also says that the United States will pay debts from before the Constitution was written. Finally, it says that members of the United States government have to swear that they will obey the Constitution. However, they will never have to swear that they follow a certain religion."
Debts.
"Before the United States Constitution was written, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. The Articles made the states into a Confederation."
"The first part of Article Six says that the United States will still honor and pay all of its debts from before the Constitution was written. The Article says that ""these debts are as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as [they were] under the Confederation [governed by the Articles of Confederation]."""
Supremacy.
"The second clause of Article Six is often called the ""Supremacy Clause."" It says that these things are the ""supreme"" laws in the United States the most powerful and most important laws in the country:"
Because these laws are supreme:
"For example, part of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights gives people the right to freedom of religion. Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land:"
Later in history.
A few Supreme Court decisions helped make the Supremacy Clause clearer.
"The first important case was ""Marbury v. Madison"" (1803). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that it had the power to review state courts' decisions, if those decisions seemed like they did not follow the supreme law. This power is called judicial review."
"In ""Martin v. Hunter's Lessee"" (1816), the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was more powerful than the state Supreme Courts. In the case, the Virginia Supreme Court said that a United States Supreme Court decision was unconstitutional, and told all of the Virginia state courts not to obey it. The United States Supreme Court ruled that it had the final say in legal issues that had to do with federal laws not the state courts. If a state court and the United States Supreme Court disagree, the Supreme Court is the supreme law of the land."
"Three years later, in ""McCulloch v. Maryland"" (1819), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot control federal institutions. The state of Maryland had tried to tax a federal bank. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot tax government property. This was another example of a case where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the ""supreme laws of the land"" were more powerful than state laws or court decisions."
"In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled on ""Gibbons v. Ogden"" (1824). The state of New York had given Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. However, Thomas Gibbons got the same power from a federal government permit. The Supreme Court decided that the federal permit was more powerful than the state monopoly. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote:"
"Finally, in ""Reid v. Covert"" (1957), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no branch of the United States government can be given extra powers by a treaty, if those powers were not given to it by the Constitution. This case showed that the Constitution could even limit the power of treaties, and was truly the supreme law of the land."
Mugello is a landscape in northern Italy. Mugello is north of Florence. The Santerno River's valley is nearby. The two valleys are separated by the Futa Pass (a path or way to cross over the mountain between those two valleys).
"In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (also called the Magelli tribe), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left very few signs behind because the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to many castles. Later on, Mugello was taken over by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built villas (large houses) there. They were similar to ones built by the Medici royal family."
Friar
"Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life, rather than living like ascets in a monastery."
Orders.
"There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four ""great orders"" and the so-called ""lesser orders""."
Four great orders.
"The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and are:"
Lesser orders.
The lesser orders are:
Carmelites
"The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel; ) is a Roman Catholic religious order. It was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel, from which the order receives its name. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. The order of Carmelite nuns was made official in 1452."
Samael
"Samael () (also Sammael and Şamil) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic beliefs and stories, as well as Christian tradition and demonology. There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome."
"Samael is often accorded with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven."
Powers.
"The website Catholic.org says Samael is a ""Power"", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels."
"Powers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness."
In Judaism and Christianity.
"In Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. ""Yalkut I, 110"" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In ""Sotah 10b"", Samael is Esau's guardian angel."
"In the ""Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer"", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent."
"Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son."
"According to ""The Ascension of Moses"" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:"
"""In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, ""Anger,"" and Hemah, ""Wrath,"" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, ""Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,"" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. ""This one,"" said Metatron, addressing Moses, ""is Samael, who takes the soul away from man."" ""Whither goes he now?"" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, ""To fetch the soul of Job the pious."" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, ""O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel."""
"In ""The Holy Kabbalah"" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the ""severity of God"", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution."
"Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means ""He who sees God""."
Popular culture.
Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana.
"In the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat."

Eisner criticized the cumbersome play, the actors performances were ""not significant"", which they impute to the fact that Murnau not experienced at this time in the lead actor had been enough."
In other media.
"Aaron Copland's 1922 ballet ""Grohg"" (unpublished and unpremiered until 1992) used ""Nosferatu"" as the physical model for the lead character and roughly follows the storyline."

"Werner Herzog's 1979 homage to Nosferatu, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" starred Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, not Orlok. A sequel to Herzog's film called ""Vampire in Venice"" starred Kinski, this time as Nosferatu, and Christopher Plummer as Paris Catalano."
"The 1979 television movie ""Salem's Lot"" modeled the appearance of Mr. Barlow on that of Count Orlok. In 1998, Wayne Keeley released """", in which the original film was remastered to a soundtrack by Type O Negative and hosted by David Carradine."
"The 2000 Hollywood movie ""Shadow of the Vampire"" told a secret history of the making of ""Nosferatu"", imagining that actor Max Schreck (played by Willem Dafoe) was actually a genuine vampire and that director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich) was complicit in hiring the creature for the purpose of realism."
"Similarly, the short film 'La duodécima hora' by Rodrigo Plaza and film critic Juanma Ruiz, suggested a hidden plot orchestrated by Nosferatu director and producer, F. W. Murnau and Albin Grau, to hide an elixir of the eternal life. Shot as a mockumentary, the film starred horror icon Paul Naschy and Nosferatu film restorer Luciano Berriatúa."
"Viper Comics's 2010 graphic novel ""Nosferatu"" by Christopher Howard Wolf retold the original 1922 film's storyline with a modern setting and cast."

There is a vaccine that can prevent it, so most cases of it are in places where people cannot afford, cannot get, or refuse to get the vaccine. However, this vaccine does not work forever. The disease lasts about 6 weeks, and symptoms include vomiting, violent coughing, and other flu-like symptoms. It is called whooping cough for the sound an infected person makes when they cough."

Deity
"A deity is thought to be a powerful spirit that controls events and the nature of things. Deities are also called gods. A female god is often called a goddess. The adjective of deity is ‘divine’. This word comes from the Latin ""deus"" (female: ""dea"")."

Deism is the belief that a deity exists, but that the deity does not very often change or never changes things in the universe. Pantheism is the belief that the universe is the deity, while atheism is the belief that there are no deities."
"In most religions, believers think deities are immortal (cannot die), and have powers far beyond human powers."

Odin
"Odin (Old Norse: ""Óðinn"") is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology. Son of Borr and the giantess (jötunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the Æsir and king of Asgard. He is married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, Höðr, Víðarr, and Váli."
"Known as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target."
"A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the Well of Urðr, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being Mímir, which recites secret knowledge to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wōtan, all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *""wōđanaz""."
"The modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god’s name. (from Old English ""Wōdnesdæg"", “Wōden’s day”)."
Family.
"Odin is the son of Borr and the jötunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and Höðr. With the giantesses Gríðr and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named Víðarr and Váli. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by Jörð, the personification of the Earth."
Qazi Muhammad
"Qazi Muhammad (1893-1947) was the Nationalist and Religious Kurdish leader and the Head of Republic of Mahabad (Republic of Kurdistan), the second modern Kurdish state in the Middle East (after Republic of Ararat). He acted as the president of the Russian backed Republic of Mahabad, in Kurdistan of Iran (Eastern Kurdistan) in 1946. He was also the founder of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. A year later, the Kurdish national movement (Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd) that he helped organize was crushed by Iran's central government. The Iranian military court sentenced him to death, and he was hanged in Chuwarchira Square in the center of city of Mahabad at March 30 1947. Mustafa Barzani, the father of nationalist Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan (Southern Kurdistan), was the defence minister in his cabinet. One of his sons Ali Qazi is today an active member in the Kurdish movement."
Brine
"Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food. For this it is much like vinegar or sugar. Brine is also used to transport heat. Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5°C, a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°C, it can hold 23.3% salt."
"Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin, allergies and common colds."
Aladdin
"Aladdin is a fictional person from the story ""Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp"", which is part of the ""Book of One Thousand and One Nights""."

Election history.
Phouoibi Waron
"The Phouoibi Waron () or the Phouoibi Warol () is an old Meitei text (PuYa) written in a period between 13th and 14th century AD. It deals with the life story of the lovers of Phouoibi, the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism)."
The story in the text is a very usual product of the agriculture of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Phouoibi is believed to be very fickle in love. She has multiple lovers. Her lovers are generally mortals. She doesn't live with anyone of them forever. She travels from place to place and makes love with many mortals. But she leaves them after some time. She lives with some of her favourite lovers for some time but she leaves them too. The nature of the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest is imagined to be fickle or tricky. This symbolises that wealth isn't a permanent property. It doesn't last long to a certain place. Devastations due to battles and natural disasters were common in ancient times. It is the reason why the paddy goddess was considered to be very irregular in bestowing her favor to the mankind.
"The Phouoibi Waron and many other PuYas reveal much about the Meitei rites and rituals of ancient times. These rites and rituals are still widely practiced by the maibas, maibis and others."

Franz Magill
"Franz Hermann Anton Magill (August 22, 1900 – April 14, 1972) was a German riding instructor, SS officer and war criminal of the Nazi era."
Background.
"Franz Magill was the son of a day laborer. His father bought a small farm in Zuchen in 1908, where Magill graduated from elementary school. He was called up at the end of the First World War and after the end of the war in 1919 he became a volunteer (twelve donors) in the Hussar Regiment No. 5 of the Reichswehr. In 1923 he was promoted to sergeant, in 1928 to sergeant. In 1929 he passed the riding instructor examination at the riding school in Belgard and, after leaving the Reichswehr, went to the private ""German riding school"" at Gut Düppel in Berlin as a qualified riding instructor."
"After the National Socialists took power in 1933, Magill joined the SS and directed the riding instruction of an SS Reitersturms. In March 1935 he became a full-time SS leader riding instructor at the SS Junker School in Braunschweig and made a career there. At the end of 1935 he was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer and, after he joined the NSDAP in 1937 (membership number 4.137.171), to SS-Sturmbannführer on April 20, 1938."
"Shortly after the attack on Poland, Magill received the order to set up SS cavalry squadrons in Gut Düppel and, in September 1939, in Lodsch in occupied Poland, then two months later in the Lublin district. There, the basis of the SS skull rider standards (two regiments) formed. In May 1940, Magill received an order from Hermann Fegelein to set up the 2nd SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandard. Magill was not up to the task. In April 1941 he was recalled as leader of the 2nd regiment and commander of a cavalry division with four squadrons.The regimental leader of the 1st regiment was Hermann Fegelein and the 2nd regiment SS-Sturmbannführer was Heimo Hierthes (1897-1951).

1984 Winter Olympics
"The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. (Sarajevo is now in Bosnia and Herzegovina.) Other candidate cities were Sapporo, Japan and Falun, Sweden. It was the first Winter Games and the second Olympics held in Eastern Europe (the first was the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow)."
1988 Winter Olympics
"The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and opened by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé. The Olympics were highly successful financially as they brought in million-dollar profits. The games left a lasting impression on the host city and gave it a new identity from a cowtown to a large commercial sector of the country."
1988 was also the last year that the Paralympic Games and the Winter Olympics were held in separate cities. All Games after the 1988 Winter Olympics have been hosted by the same city or a city nearby.
"The Canadian team did not win a gold medal during the 1988 Winter Olympics, similar to how the Canadian team did not win one during the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. At the time, Canada and Yugoslavia were the only countries that had not won a gold medal when their country hosted the Olympics. (However, Canada would later win a gold medal when the 2010 Winter Olympics were hosted in Vancouver.)"

Football at the Summer Olympics
Football (soccer) has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932 as a men's competition sport. Women's football was added to the official program at the 1996 Atlanta edition.
History.
"Football was not in the original modern Olympic Games program as international football was not that popular in 1896. However an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition. Complete records have been lost and may not even be true but it seems that only two games may have been played. An Athens XI lost to a team representing Smyrna (Izmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. Smyrna went on to be beaten 15-0 by a team from Denmark. Demonstration tournaments were played at the 1900 and 1904 games and the ""Intercalated Games"" of 1906, but these were contested by various clubs and scratch teams, and are not considered to be official Olympic events. Neither FIFA nor the IOC recognize the Intercalated Games. The first proper tournament is said to be in the 1908 Olympics, organized by the Football Association. It had 6 teams. The next tournament was organized by the Swedish Football Association in 1912. However, the tournament was very unbalanced, with some high scoring games such as 10-0 and 12-0, and all of the players were amateurs. The tournaments of 1924 and 1928 are the two only editions officially recognised by FIFA as championships of the world."
"For the 1984 Olympics, the IOC admitted professional players."
"Since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, all teams have to be under-23 years old. Since 1996, three over 23 players are allowed."
"A women's edition was added in 1996. The women's tournament has no age restrictions, unlike the men's tournament."
1976 Winter Olympics
"The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria. The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado, United States in May 1970, but a 300 percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to voters' rejection of a $5 million bond issue to finance the games in 1972. As a result, the IOC offered the games to Whistler, British Columbia (Canada), who had bid on the games, but they also declined due to a change of government there. (Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.) The IOC finally called on Innsbruck, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Games just twelve years earlier, to also host the 1976 games. Salt Lake City, Utah, which would eventually host in 2002, offered itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC declined."
Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics
"Gymnastics has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. For thirty years, only men were allowed to compete. Women's events were introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The competition was held in artistic gymnastics discipline until 1984, when rhythmic gymnastics discipline was added to the program of the Olympics. Since 2000, trampolining discipline has also been competed."
Jnana yoga
"In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the yoga or practice of knowledge. Jyâna in Sanskrit means ""knowledge""."
"In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that jyâna consists of properly understanding ""kshetra"" (the field of activity—that is, the body) and ""kshetra-jna"" (the knower of the body—that is, the soul). Krishna emphasizes one must understand the difference between these two. ""Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal."""

E-book
"An electronic book (also called an e-book, ebook or digital book) is a book in digital form. E-books can be read on computers or other electronic devices such as e-book readers. E-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, the Kobo eReader and the are devices which are dedicated to showing e-books."
History.
"The first e-book might have been the Index Thonisticus, prepared by Roberto Busa in the late 1940s. However, this is sometimes not called an ebook because the digital text was (at least at first) meant to develop an index and concordance, rather than as a published edition in its own rights."
"Despite the extensive earlier history, it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is Michael S. Hart. In 1971, Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois. Seeking a worthy use of this resource, he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer."
"One early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer, the Dynabook, in the 1970s at PARC: a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading."
"In 1992, Sony launched the Data Discman, an electronic book reader that could read e-books that were stored on CDs. One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future."
"Early e-books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience, meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups. The scope of the subject matter of these e-books included technical manuals for hardware, manufacturing techniques and other subjects. In the 1990s, the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier, including e-books."
"The current eBook standard is the file. There are other proprietary formats like .MOBI, AZW, IBA and PDF."
Church–Turing thesis
"The Church-Turing thesis (also known as Church's thesis, Church's conjecture and Turing's thesis) is a statement about computers. It says that a very simple kind of computer now named a “Turing machine” is able to compute all computable functions. The Church-Turing thesis is linked to Gödel's incompleteness theorems."
"When a programming language is able to do what a Turing machine can do, that language is called Turing complete. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is solvable in all of those."

"Henriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil."
"Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337 people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000 sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 Olive Ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state."
"In Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450 homes and damaged another 5,000 dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70 homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000 families were left homeless."
One woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast.
"The road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obregón was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600 cars. Lázaro Cárdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50 houses in the community of ""El Habillal"", were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing."
"The remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). The name ""Henriette"" was not retired from use by the World Meteorological Organization, and will be used again in 2013."

"Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone."
Home Rule.
"Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the ""Land League"") on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics."
Personal life.
Katherine O'Shea.
"On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance."
"O'Shea at last filed for divorce. He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular."
"Parnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old."
Haruki Murakami
"is a Japanese author and translator. He was born on January 12, 1949 in Kyoto, Japan. In 2006 he won the Franz Kafka Prize for his book ""Kafka on the Shore""."
Sinhala language
"Sinhala or Sinhalese, earlier referred to as Singhalese, is the language of the Sinhalese. They are largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family."
"Sinhala has two varieties/forms - Spoken and Written, the former being the most popular form. Spoken Sinhala is easier to learn and use because it is so much relaxed in grammatical formality and rigidity."
"Sinhala is spoken by about 19 million people in Sri Lanka, about 16 million of them are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, with Tamil. Sinhala has its own writing system (see Sinhala script) which is an offspring of the Indian Brahmi script."
The oldest Sinhala inscriptions were written in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC; the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century AD.
"The closest relative of Sinhala is Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives, ."
"The word order of Sinhala language is SOV (subject-object-verb) just like Japanese, Korean and many other languages in Asia. It would be easy for people from that particular language style to learn Sinhala with a little time and practice."
Liber Pontificalis said:
He died on 18 October 707 and was buried in Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was succeeded by Pope Sisinnius.
World Trade Center site
"The World Trade Center site refers to the area of land in Lower Manhattan in New York City, that hosted both the original and new World Trade Centers. The land was originally underwater. The first World Trade Center complex of buildings stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The new World Trade Center complex is mostly complete and is built on the site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns most of the land. The site is overseen by Studio Daniel Libeskind, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation."
September 11 attacks.
"On the morning of September 11, 2001, two airplanes were captured by terrorists close to al-Qaeda and crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The towers fell within two hours after the crashes. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks. After the attacks, hospital workers and police offers began calling the site ""Ground Zero""."
Debris and clean-up.
"When the towers fell, they caused dust to spread in New York City, and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. The New York City Fire Department separated the site into four areas to make cleanup of the site and the search for people who survived the attack easier. Early on, it was said that the debris at the site would take a year to get rid of, but cleanup ended in May 2002. Building materials and debris from Ground Zero were sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island."
"In December 2001, a viewing area at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public."
"On March 11, 2002, six months after the attacks, the Tribute in Light, a memorial with two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky, began. It was lit up every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, it was lit up for the second anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2003. It has been lit up every September 11 since then."
New buildings.
The new World Trade Center complex will have the following buildings:
"Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush said that they would rebuild the World Trade Center. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani said, ""We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again."" During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of workers through a megaphone. A person in the crowd shouted, ""I can't hear you,"" to which Bush replied, ""I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."""
"In an address to Congress, the president said, ""As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City."" However, 20 years after the attacks, only four buildings, One World Trade Center, 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center and 7 World Trade Center, have been rebuilt. One building, One World Trade Center, is currently under construction."
"In November 2001, Governor Pataki started the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center. The LMDC leads federal help in the rebuilding, and works with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind. It also communicates with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and the families of the people who were killed in the September 11 attacks."
National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.
"A memorial, ""Reflecting Absence"", honors the people killed in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad. It has a field of trees with the footprints of the original towers. The footprints are filled with pools of water. It opened on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2011."
"On October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta, an architectural company from Norway, would design a performing arts center and museum at the site. It is a museum and a visitors' center for the site. The museum opened in 2014."
Criticism.
"An episode of CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in 2010 was about the lack of work done at Ground Zero. It focused on how most of the buildings did not have a date for completion, the main building, One World Trade Center (originally called the Freedom Tower), having gone through three different designs, and the delays and high amount of money that went into the rebuilding. Larry Silverstein said that the entire site would be completed in 2037, and that billions of dollars have been spent on rebuilding the site, even though Ground Zero ""is still a hole in the ground."" During an interview for the episode, Silverstein said, ""I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime."" However, it was said in early 2011 that a lot of work has been done on the site, with all five buildings under construction. All of the buildings will be completed between 2012 and 2016. Criticism of the work being done at Ground Zero was made in 2008 and 2009, when there was no work being done at the site."
River Humber
"The River Humber is a large deep water estuary on the east coast of Northern England. It is formed by the River Ouse and the River Trent coming together. From here to the North Sea (about 40 miles) it forms part of the border between the East Riding of Yorkshire on the north side and Lincolnshire on the south side. The Humber's only modern crossing is the Humber Bridge. At one time it the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Now it is the fifth longest. Before the bridge was built in 1981, paddle steamers were used to cross the mile long span."
History.
"In the middle ages the tides of the Humber kept armies from crossing. At that time it was thought to be an arm of the ocean. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the Humber was a major boundary, separating Northumbria from the southern kingdoms. The name Northumbria came from Old English ""Northanhymbre"" meaning ""the people north of the Humber"". The Vikings used the Humber and its two tributaries, the Ouse and Trent, with their shallow-draft Longships to raid all over northeastern England."
Fortresses.
Fort Paull was a Napoleonic era fort built in 1542 to protect the port there. The site dates back to 910 when it was a lookout for Viking raiders. The current fort is designed as a pentagon and was built from 1861–1864. It was disarmed at the beginning of the First World War and replaced by two nearby forts. One was on Sunk Island; the other was at Stallingborough. In 1960 the fort was finally closed down. But in 1964 a group of volunteers took over the fort and made it into a Museum.
France Roche
"France Roche (2 April 1921 – 14 December 2013) was a French actress and screenwriter. She appeared in 17 movies between 1951 and 1979. She died on 14 December 2013 from natural causes, aged 92."
"Many people like to make their own paper. Engel describes a process shown to him by Robert J. Lang that is ""a sandwich of aluminum foil and two pieces of tissue paper."" In this method, two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil. Many people like origami because there is almost always paper. Copy paper, napkins, wallpaper, index cards, and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models."
Tools.
"Many paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on, but others, like the Japanese, fold in the air. Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding, but many modern folders use other tools when folding. Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds. Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models."
Types.
New types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models.
Pureland.
"Pureland origami is origami with one rule: only one fold can be made at a time. British paperfolder John Smith started pureland origami for inexperienced paperfolders or for people with poor motor skills. Hard folds, like the inside-reverse fold, are not allowed in pureland origami."

"JSPWiki is a feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki software built around the standard J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP)."
It was created by Janne Jalkanen.
Statement
Statement has several meanings:
Salvation
"In theology, salvation can mean various things:"
Polyhedron
"A polyhedron (one polyhedron, many ""polyhedra"", or ""polyhedrons"") is a geometrical shape. It is a 3D shape with flat faces, and straight edges. Each face is a polygon surrounded by edges. Usually it is defined by the number of faces, or edges."
Two types of polyhedron are convex and concave. The line connecting any two points of a convex polyhedron is inside the polyhedron. The line connecting two points of a concave polyhedron may go outside the polyhedron.
"Mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron. They do agree that there are five Platonic solids, which are regular polyhedra. On a regular polyhedron, all faces are the same and all vertices are the same."
Naming.
"Usually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), heptahedron (seven faces) and octahedron (eight faces). Prisms, pyramids and other shapes can also be named according to how many faces they have."
Pentagon
"A pentagon is a polygon with five edges. It is defined by five points, which are all on a plane. If all the edges have the same length and the angles at the corners are all 108°, the pentagon is called ""regular"". If the pentagon intersects itself, it is called a pentagram."
"Pentagons also occur in nature: Fruits of the Okra are pentangular. The flowers of Ipomoea are pentagular. In chemistry, many Cyclic compounds are pentangles: Cyclopentane and Furan are examples for this. In architecture, many bastions are pentangular: Bourtange, in the Netherlands has been completely restored, and is a pentangle. The Citadel of Lille, Nyenschantz, near St. Petersburg, or the Citadel of Pamplona are . The Villa Farnese is a palace in the form of a pentagon, so is the castle of Nowy Wiśnicz. The Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk near Žďár nad Sázavou also uses a pentangular design."
Formulas.
"""Note: these formulas only work for regular pentagons."""

formula_2
"Modern Turkey's varied climate lets many kinds of food crops grow, and livestock and forestry are important industries. Turkey makes enough food to feed itself. Turkish manufactures include aeroplanes, electronics, cars, clothing and textiles for home and for other countries."
"Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beaches on its Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, and many important historical places."
History.
Ancient Anatolia.
"The first major empire in the area was the Hittites (from the 18th century to the 13th century BCE). The Hittites, who spoke one of the Indo-European languages, developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the Sea People in the 11th century BCE and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia."
"From 1950 BCE, Armenians and Assyrians inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BCE). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until their empire was conquered by Babylonia in 612 BCE. Then Anatolia became home for various kingdoms including the Achaemenid Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), Seljuk Empire, and Mongol Empire."
The Ottoman Empire.
"During the 14th century, after the fall of the Mongol Empire, Gazi Osman built a new empire named after himself: the Ottoman Empire. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the Balkans, (Yugoslavia and Bulgaria) in Europe. The Empire was ruled by Islamic law, but other religions had certain minority rights."
"In World War I the Ottoman Empire was one of the Central Powers. During the war, 500,000 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called Armenian genocide. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that Atatürk led the newly formed Turkish army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks and ousted the imperial Ottoman family from Anatolia."
Republic of Türkiye.
"Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the first President of Turkey. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatürk felt that he weakened Islam in the country. Later political disputes led to Coup d'état in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts."
"In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and later established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş became the first Turkish Cypriot president."
"On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted."
"In 2022, the government of Turkey started to use the Turkish spelling of Türkiye in both Turkish and English. However, Turkey remains the more common name."
People.
About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are ethnic Turks. About 15% are ethnic Kurds. Many refugees from Syria (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the Syrian civil war. Many Romani live in Istanbul and Edirne (European part of Turkey).
The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. Much of the population in Turkey is made up of young adults and adults.
"According to religiosity poll conducted in Turkey in 2019 by OPTİMAR, 89.5% of the population identifies as Muslim, 4.5% believed in God but did not belong to an organized religion, 2.7% were agnostic, 1.7% were atheist, 0.5% were belonged to the other religions, and 1.1% did not answer. Another poll conducted by Gezici Araştırma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and found that 28.5% of the Generation Z in Turkey identify as irreligious."
"Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as mantı (Turkish ravioli), döner, kebap, Turkish delight (lokum), baklava, lahmacun, börek, köfte, and other foods."
"According to a study, Anatolia is genetically more closely related to the Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of Anatolia (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from Central Asia."
Majority and minorities.
"Most people in Turkey are Turks. The largest minority is Kurds. Kurds live mostly in Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are the Romani, mostly live in East Thrace, the European side of Turkey."
Economy.
Turkey is in the OECD and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.
"In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey."
"Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's international trade is mostly with the EU, the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey."
Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion United States dollars.
"Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no petroleum and not much natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"Rich cities in Turkey include Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Edirne, Konya, Mersin (also known as İçel), and Antalya."
Culture.
Language.
"Most people in Turkey speak Turkish. It is written in Latin script and it belongs to the Turkic language group, which also includes many other languages spoken across Asia, such as Azerbaijani and Tatar. The Turkish language came from Central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in Central Asia. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents."
Behavior.
"The Horned Viper is nocturnal and terrestrial (lives on the ground), and is usually found buried underneath the sand. They are said to be slow moving, but they are able to do sidewinding. When they do sidewinding they can move faster across the sand. They are able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. They sink into the sand tail first and keep on sinking deeper into the sand until only their eyes and nose are sticking out of the sand. The reason they do this is so they can ambush prey which come close to it. They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. They live in the deserts of North Africa, Arabia, and Iran."
Feeding.
"The Horned Viper catch their prey by ambushing. They eat mainly rodents, birds and lizards."
Las Vegas culture
"Las Vegas culture is the name for a number of setltements on the coast of present-day Ecuador. These settlements were created between roughly 8000 and 4600 BCE. In total, there are 31 settlements. The people who lived there were hunter-gatherers. They had also started agriculture. Bone points and a spatula have been discovered. They may have been used for making nets or textiles, along with various tools and containers shaped of shell; wood, bamboo, reeds, and bark are also believed to have been used in the tool industry."
No mummies have been found on the coast of Ecuador. The Las Vegas people had similarities with the people whose remains are preserved as the Chinchorro mummies of the north coast of Chile.They also lived at the same time.
Yu Kil-chun
"Yu Kil-chun (, 1856 – 1914) was a Korean politician, philosopher, thinker, reform activist and independence activist during the Joseon Dynasty. His nickname was Gudang, Chunmin, Guyil."
Life.
"Yu Kil-chun was born in Kwangju. In his early years he studied under Park Kyu-su and Oh Kyung-suk. As a young man in 1881, he went to Meiji Japan to study at Keio University. He then went to the United States in 1884 to study mathematics. After his he was accused of supporting the ""Gaehwadang"" (enlightenment party). He was arrested and put in jail from 1885 to 1894."
"Between 1894 and 1895, Yu worked for the government of prime minister Kim Hongjip. He was Vice Minister of State for Home Office. In October 1895, Korea's King Gojong claimed that Yu was involved in the assassination of Queen Min. Kim was killed and his cabinet was disbanded. Yu went to the Russian embassy and escaped the country for exile in Japan. He returned to Korea in 1907 after he was pardoned by Emperor Sunjeong."
"In 1910, when Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan, Yun started a movement against the annexation. Yu was offered the title ""danshaku"" by the Government of Japan, but he refused it. He died in 1914 of a heart problem. He was aged 58."
Plot
Plot may mean:
Katherine Jackson
"Katherine Esther Jackson (born May 4, 1930 as Kattie B. Screws) is the matriarch of the Jackson family of musicians and singers, including Michael Jackson, La Toya and Janet Jackson. She is the widow of Joe Jackson."
"Jackson had 10 children. Several of the children became famous. In 1986 ""Essence"" honored her as ""Mother of the Year""."
"In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, ""My Family"". The book told about her elderly years and her relationship with her husband and their children."
"On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died. Katherine was granted temporary guardianship of Michael's three children. In 2012 her guardianship was suspended for a short time. The guardianship resumed with TJ Jackson, Michael's nephew, added as a co-guardian."
Fax
"Fax (short for facsimile), or telecopying, is the transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device."
"The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which turns the contents (text or images) into a bitmap, Then the bitmap is sent through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image, printing a paper copy."
"Businesses usually have some kind of fax system, but the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based methods. Fax machines still retain some advantages, particularly in the transmission of sensitive material which, if sent over the internet, may be intercepted. However, encryption (a secret coding system) can make internet messages secure."
"In some countries, because electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business."
"In many businesses, standalone fax machines have been replaced by fax servers which receive and store incoming faxes electronically. The servers route them to users on paper or via a secure email. Such systems reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound phone lines needed by an office."
History.
"On his journey home, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus. They go inside his cave at the sight of sheep, cheese and milk. Polyphemus catches them and eats some of Odysseus' men. Odysseus tricks and blinds him and they escape. The Cyclops prays to his father Poseidon that Odysseus would not get home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home, Odysseus would lose all of his men, his ship and find trouble at home. This prayer becomes the plot line of the Odyssey."
The Sirens.
"Odysseus and his ship have to pass the Sirens' island. The Sirens were always singing very beautifully, so sailors would try to go to them, but their ships would get destroyed, and they would die."
"Odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears, so they will not hear the song of the sirens. He also tells his men to bind him to the ship's mast, so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song. His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore, because he is calm again. Then they can take the wax out of their ears, and free Odysseus."
Calypso.
"After escaping from the sea, and the death of his men, Odysseus comes to the island Ogygia. On this island lives the nymph Calypso, and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god Hermes came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus immortality (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife Penelope. So Odysseus built a raft and left her."
The Phaeacians.
"After a storm, Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians. There he is found by the king's daughter Nausicaä. Nausicaä brings him to the palace of her father, King Alkinoos. During his time there, Odysseus tell the story of his journey. After this, Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca."
Return home.
"During all this time, Penelope has been keeping the suitors at bay with a ruse (trick). She promises ""I will choose when I have finished weaving this cloth"", the cloth being a burial cloth for Odysseus' father. However, every night her servant unpicks the work of the previous day. The story is made more real by Penelope becoming restless. The goddess Athena causes Penelope to feel the need to display herself, and fan the flames of the suitors' desire."
"Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, where he disguises himself as a beggar. He goes to his home and meets his son Telemachus. Together they kill the suitors, who are trying to marry Penelope in order to gain his kingdom. Later, the families of the suitors come to kill Odysseus for revenge. The goddess Athena helps Odysseus by making them stop and give up the fight."
Mae West
"Mae West (August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress. She worked in vaudeville and later in movies. She is best-remembered for her dirty jokes and comedy movies."
"Her name when she was born was Mary Jane West. She was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and died in Hollywood, California. Her mother was a German immigrant and former model."
Lenny Bruce
"Lenny Bruce (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), was an American comedian. His real name was Leonard Alfred Schneider. He is considered an innovator of modern stand-up comedy and changed the way many people see comedians. His jokes and routines were very improper and off limits for the time and he got in a lot of trouble for them. He is considered a hero for the defense of the First Amendment rights in the United States, especially for free speech."
"In the 1960s he was the last person arrested for impersonating and swearing, overwatched by martial law and police and banned from many cities and comedy clubs."
"He appeared on the cover of The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album."
He died in 1966 of an accidental morphine overdose whist on trial.
"In 1970 the New York's highest court of appeals decided that he is ""not guilty for using bad words""."
Kimchi
"Kimchi (; ; ), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with many seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made from napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber as a main ingredient."
"Kimchi is usually very strong for non-Koreans. There are many different types and Koreans typically eat kimchi in every meal. It is a staple of Korean food. Kimchi can be stored for a long time and it does not go bad easily. However, when it is exposed to hot weather for certain time, kimchi turns sour. So, it should not be put out unless it is going to be eaten soon. In Korea kimchi pots are a common sight. They are large terra cotta pots where the kimchi is stored until it can be eaten or until it ferments. Kimchi usually takes about 2 weeks to ferment, but some varieties can be eaten right away. Some must be stored for over a year to be finished."
The fermentation gives the kimchi a pickle-like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good.
Varieties.
"Every different kind of kimchi has a special taste and a different amount of time to ferment. Baechu Kimchi is one of the most famous kimchi. Kkakdugi is made of cubed Korean radish (mu). It’s especially contains more water and is hard to chew. Baek kimchi uses milder ingredients. It’s not spicy. Chonggak kimchi has a smallish white radish that comes with a ponytail. Gat kimchi is made from dark green Korean mustard (gat) leaves and stems. These can be kept for months or even longer. As these age, they taste like lemons. Oi Sobagi has a refreshing, cool, and hot taste. Cucumber is the main ingredient for it. It can be kept for about a week. As it ages, it also taste like a lemon. Dongchimi is a food and a beverage all in one. When it ferments, it becomes sweet and taste a lot like lemon water. It can be kept for about a month."
Preparation.
"The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage, radish, garlic, red pepper, salt and sugar. The cabbage is soaked in salt water for a few hours. Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage. Red peppers are also rubbed in and most Kimchi has a lot of pepper in it. The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix. A little sugar is added to help the fermentation process along much in the same way beer is made. The amounts of each ingredient vary between the type of kimchi you are making and the personal taste of the maker. Most kimchi has a special taste with shrimp or fish. The kimchi is allowed to ferment for a period of time, usually outdoors in a large kimchi pot. It is also quite common for these pots to be buried under ground. Kimchi can be kept for a long time and does not go bad. Koreans make kimchi with their families in December."
Vincent van Gogh
"Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter. His work had a great influence on modern art because of its striking colours and emotional power. He suffered from delusions and fits of mental illness. When he was 37, he died by committing suicide."
"When he was a young man, Van Gogh worked for a company of art dealers. He traveled between The Hague, London and Paris. After that, he taught in England. He then wanted to become a pastor and spread the Gospel, and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining place in Belgium. He began drawing the people there, and in 1885, he painted his first important work, ""The Potato Eaters"". He usually painted in dark colors at this time. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and found out about the French impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France, and the colors in his art became brighter. His special style of art was developed and later fully grown during the time he stayed in Arles in 1888."
Early life.
"He was born Vincent Willem van Gogh on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. His father, Theodorus van Gogh, was a pastor. His mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was an artist. Van Gogh was brought up in a religious and cultured family. He was very emotional and he did not have a great deal of self-confidence. He was also a replacement child. He was born a year after the death of his brother, also named Vincent. He even had the same birthday. Living at the church rectory Vincent walked past the grave of his dead brother every day. There has been speculation that van Gogh suffered later psychological trauma as a result, but this cannot be proved."
Career.
"Between 1860 and 1880, when he finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had two sad romances. He also had worked unsuccessfully in a bookstore, as an art salesman, and a preacher. He remained in Belgium, where he had preached, to study art. The works of his early Dutch period are sad, sharp, and one of the most famous pictures from here is ""The Potato Eaters"", painted in 1885. In that year, van Gogh went to Antwerp where he found the works of famous artists and bought a lot of Japanese prints."
"In 1886 he went to Paris to join his brother Theo, who was the manager of Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon. He also met Pissarro, Monet, and Gauguin. This helped the colors of his paintings lighten and be painted in short strokes from the paintbrush. His nervous temper made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined with painting all day made him very unhealthy. He decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help found a school of art. Gauguin did join him, but it did not help. Near the end of 1888, Gauguin left Arles. Van Gogh followed him with an open razor, but was stopped by Gauguin. Instead, he cut his own ear lobe off. After that, van Gogh began to get fits of madness and was sent to the asylum in Saint-Remy for medical treatment. He painted over 1,000 portraits."
Death.
"In May 1890, he regained his health and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise. However, two months later on 27 July, he shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died two days later, with Theo at his side. Theo reported his last words as ""La tristesse durera toujours"", which meant, ""The sadness will last forever"" in French."
Legacy.
"During his brief career he had only sold one painting. After his death, Van Gogh's finest works were all sold in less than three years. His mother threw away a lot of his paintings during his life and even after his death. But she lived long enough to see him become a world famous painter. He was not well known when he was alive, and most people did not appreciate his art. But he became very famous after his death. Today, many people consider him to be one of the greatest painters in history and an important influence on modern art. Van Gogh did not begin painting until he was almost 30. Most of his famous works were done in his last two years. He made more than 2,000 artworks, with 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches. Today, many of his pieces portraits, landscapes and sunflowers are some of the most famous and costly works of art in the world."
Rainbow
"A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. The pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts with red on the outside and changes through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen."
"A rainbow is created when white light is bent (refracted) while entering a droplet of water, split into separate colours, and reflected back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the Sun."
"Rainbows often appear after storms, and are popular symbols for peace in many cultures."
Cause.
The rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle.
Rainbows always appear opposite the Sun: they form circles around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the Sun).
"While sunlight is white, all white light is actually a blend of many different colours. Water and other materials bend the different colours at different angles, some more strongly than others. This is called dispersion. By splitting up white light into its separate colours, rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is white."
The rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when:
Another common place to see the rainbow effect is near waterfalls. Parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time:
An unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day.
The seven colours of the rainbow.
"The rainbow has no definite number of physical colours, but seven are traditionally listed. Below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow. Computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar. (Each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color.)"
The gray rainbows.

USB flash drives are used with devices found in homes, workplaces and schools. Below are some examples of these devices:"
"They are called ""flash drive"" because they use flash memory to store files. Flash memory is a type of computer chip. The first flash drives had 8 megabytes of storage. Each year, larger flash drives will become available. In April 2012, 256 gigabyte flash drives were introduced to the market."
"Other common names for a flash drive include jumpdrive, pendrive, thumbdrive or simply USB."
"USB flash drives have some advantages over other portable storage devices. They are physically much smaller and more rugged than floppy disks. They can read data faster, and store more data than floppy disks. Floppy disks have become obsolete when the price of USBs has become cheaper."
Uses.
"Flash drives are used to store any type of data file, or to move data from one computer to another. USB flash drives have a lot of storage space. It is often easier to use a flash drive than to carry many CD-ROMs. Some computer programs can be run from a USB flash drive. These special versions of programs are called ""portable"" versions."
"Computer administrators, or people who manage the computer systems, sometimes use flash drives. Sometimes flash drives are also used to run a computer virus scanner. They are often used to repair a computer system that was damaged or faulty."

"Since then, artists including Kanye West, Nine Inch Nails and Ayumi Hamasaki have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives."
In arcades.
"In the arcade game ""In the Groove"" and ""In The Groove 2"", flash drives are used to transfer high scores, screenshots, dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. In later versions, players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be Linux compatible, causing problems for some players."

"In the arcade game ""Dance Dance Revolution X"", a special USB flash drive was made by Konami, letting players link the Sony PlayStation 2 version."
Brand and product promotion.
"Flash drives are very cheap to produce. So, they are sometimes used to promote a product. At most technical trade fairs, many exhibitors will promote their products by giving away free drives."
"In other situations, they may be sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another product."
"Usually, such drives will be stamped with a company's logo, as a form of advertising ."
"The drive may be blank drive, or already have documents or software loaded on to it. These are called preloaded drives."

Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 153 AD (120 years of reign).
Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 154 AD (121 years of reign).
"AD 54, AD 153 or AD 154 maybe either his year of ""death"" or ""removal from the power of monarchy"", which is not confirmed."
Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years. This does not exclude the theoretical possibility that in the case of a fortunate combination of mutations there could be a person who lives longer.
Some scientists cautiously suggest that the human body can have sufficient resources to live up to 150 years.
"According to Anuradha Dutta and ‎Ratna Bhuyan, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was murdered and his queen Laisana saved their son, ""the prince""."
Worship as a god.
In traditional Meitei religion.
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human."
"According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing ""divine"" in daytime and appearing ""humanly"" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of ""divine origin"" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion."
In Hinduism.
"According to 's ""The Meitheis"" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to ""Enoog Howba Chonoo"", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga (""Dapar Jug"") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga (""Kali Jug""), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, ""Jobista"" (also spelled as ""Yavista"") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata."
"In the 18th century AD, the ""Vijay Panchali"" (also spelled as ""Bijoy Panchali"") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as ""Yavistha""."
"Notably, in the year 2020, ""A Short History of Manipur"", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata."
In art and culture.
"In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL)."
"Ritual ceremonies are performed and the ""Salai Taret Huiyen Lalong Thang-Ta Lup"", giving guard of honour, hoists the flag of Nongda Lairen Phakhangba."
The ceremony is performed for the purpose to preserve and promote the indigenous art and culture of Kangleipak.

"Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Zaverbai and Ladbai. He belongs to rich class agriculturist Patidar (leva patidar patel) community and Vallabhbhai’s father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi, and his mother was a very spiritual woman."
"Starting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British."
"In 1891, he married Zaverbai and the couple had two children. His daughter, Maniben Patel (1903-1990), was an activist while his son, Dahyabhai Patel (1905-1973) was a member of the parliament of India."
Patel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s words deeply affected Vallabhbhai and he soon adopted Gandhi’s principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader. That is how deeply Gandhi’s words had affected him. He didn’t know that he would change India and start a successful career.
"you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,"
I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
Yeah.
"Uh, you know."
"I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas"
"and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>."
"You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,"
"uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,"
"and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand."
"And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S"
Uh-huh.
"and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico."
"Yeah,"
definitely.
You just don't know what's going on.
Yeah.
"I'd, I,"
"every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas"
"and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C"
"and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too."
You you can tune into some stations
Uh-huh.
"and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events."
"Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area"
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.
There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.
Right.
"Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries."
I hadn't really thought about it
but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.
Right.
Exactly.
"Uh, I don't know."
"I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N."
"Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,"
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour
but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
"Right,"
yeah.
"and, uh,"
"but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,"
Yeah.
"I, I think I'd agree."
"A, a similar method of getting the news with me too."
"It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years."
"Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts."
Right.
"Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature"
"and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth."
Uh-huh.
Right.
Yeah.
"I know, the,"
"my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada."
"Uh,"
"That, that's true, you know."
"You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them."
Right.
Yeah.
"I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything"
"and, uh, it's amazing that,"
Do you know?
"No,"
"we can,"
"after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording  this."
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, can you tell me anything else about the house"
Are you working on it?
"I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?"
Yeah.
"This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice."
Yeah.
"That's, that's nice."
"Yeah,"
"the town that I came from is, uh, is a, uh, older town,"
"it like,"
"the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,"
Wow.
and I renovated a house there
and that was so much fun.
"I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically"
"And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline"
"and, uh, was considered typical for that area."
"So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box"
"and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it."
"But, uh, anyway,"
Living in the city has some advantages.
Yeah.
That's true.
"If given the choice, I'm getting out."
"Oh, really."
"Well, I have lived in a small town for, you know,"
yes.
Oh
And I don't know that's true or not.
"I mean, I just heard it in passing,"
"but so what does that,"
Right.
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
"And how is it really transmitted, et cetera."
Yeah.
"Which is, I think, what they also don't know."
"I mean that's,"
"I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,"
"but, but that isn't how it was in Africa."
No.
"In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,"
and it's huge over there.
"So I, I, you know,"
"and it's beginning, other countries"
that's what's his point.
"This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this."
Uh-huh.
"And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?"
Oh.
I mean I don't know.
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.
"Uh, or maybe they understand but,"
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, and then the people that have it,"
"it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back."
Oh.
"even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use."
"And I don't think it was my fault because I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
"but, uh, it was really, uh, it was,"
"I had to send it back after like, you know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not,"
"something was very, very wrong with the blade."
"Uh, what about you?"
"Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service."
Uh-huh.
I don't feel like that's as big a problem.
I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.
Uh-huh.
And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time."
Uh-huh.
But that's it.
"But that's, that's probably the worst."
"My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh, James Avery."
I don't know if you have that up there
"but it, it's a very good company. That  sells sterling silver things"
Uh-huh.
"and uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
"and when she stood up, it caught and broke"
and we took it back
"and they said oh, this was just obviously yanked."
Uh-huh.
This was yanked.
"Yeah,"
"it, it really is."
"Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way."
Uh-huh.
"So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back."
"Yeah,"
so you guys can actually get ahead
Yeah
"But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for."
"Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,"
Yeah.
everyone does newspapers.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
everybody does newspapers.
"But, that, that kind of stuff."
Yeah.
"But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,"
it doesn't fit in their little containers
"and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something."
"Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever up there"
Yeah
"Exactly,"
"yeah,"
"send it to this address,"
no
"But, uh, let's see,"
"they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,"
"I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good"
"and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front"
All right.
"and, I mean it was fantastic,"
Uh-huh.
"and it got good gas mileage,"
but I don't know
"I don't really, I don't,"
"I want something I can drive too, you know,"
"Well well, the mini, that,"
and I was scared to drive that big van.
"you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, uh,"
"more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet"
"and, uh, well of course, Oldsmobile has got one,"
"and Chryslers got one,"
but they drive remarkably like cars.
"Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things"
Yeah.
and it would look like it was further back than it was.
Yeah
"but, the little, thing etched in it,"
"say objects are, are closer than they appear or something"
"Yeah,"
does yours do that too?
Yeah.
"Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that,"
"Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors,"
"we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice."
"I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know,"
"these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,"
Uh-huh.
"and they're really nice, uh,"
"got them on both sides,"
Yeah.
"Well, course it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or part time. And two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college."
That's right.
"There's,"
"The, the responsibility of that."
"And, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college."
"Also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid"
"or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,"
Yes.
"and, like I said, if they was willing to work, uh, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third"
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is.
"By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest,"
"so, it's not too far away,"
"but it's,"
Mine is twelve.
"Oh, okay."
"But it's getting there,"
"I mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now."
"Uh, I would advise that, that they did not have a car at college."
"They would,"
"That's my gut feeling, too."
"I,"
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
Hello?
"Yes,"
I'm here.
"Oh, yeah, uh,"
"yes,"
I didn't have a car in college.
"I think it's more an a burden to, to provide for."
No.
"I think so, too."
Really.
"I mean, uh, uh, the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood,"
"and my wife didn't know,"
"and I stopped payment on the check,"
and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm.
"And, and they're suing us, they're suing me on this,"
and it's for a hundred and thirty-four dollars.
"Oh, my."
Absolutely pathetic.
I stopped payment on a check.
"Oh, that's funny."
"Oh, this last week, we bought a sewing machine at Zak's,"
and then I found that you could get the same machine better for less locally.
"Not much less, but it was enough less,"
and I found they locally serviced it.
And we just stopped payment on the check.
So I hope they don't sue us over it
"But we never received any merchandise either,"
so I don't think it would hold Anyway.
"Oh, okay,"
well
"probably something like that,"
"did you call them and tell them you just, you just."
"No,"
we didn't even call them.
We just did it.
Maybe my husband should call today.
"Might be a good idea, because you're going to get, what, a, a check,"
"Well, this is kind of ironic because I work in T I legal department."
Do you?
"And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, um, lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, for goodness sakes."
What do you do?
"Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, that's interesting."
"Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?"
"No,"
"mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of,"
"but, uh, I don't know,"
"I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh."
Right.
"I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything."
Uh-huh.
"Well I love to work outside, really,"
and I enjoy flowers and stuff.
"I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,"
and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
Okay.
"but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that."
"I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring"
Uh-huh.
"and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,"
"and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something"
Uh-huh.
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist
"Oh, that's terrible."
Twenty-three
"And I really feel bad about it,"
"it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, they're all gone at this point."
"And people who do have them, curse."
Right.
"Another thing I have that, um, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard."
"As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed,"
they aren't trimmed at all.
Uh-huh.
"And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down"
"so, and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it."
"Yeah,"
"they're like,"
"I think I've seen those before,"
but I don't remember what they look like.
"They're a pretty tree,"
"but you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns."
"So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,"
"So it'll give you room to get under it,"
"sure,"
"Yeah,"
"because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would rip your skin."
Yeah.
It's worse than a rose bush.
Um.
"Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree."
"Oh, a tree is always something very nice to have."
"Yeah,"
"my dad used to work on them,"
so I don't think I'll have a problem.
My husband will have problems borrowing one.
"then you got to get him to,"
"if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it."
"Well, if that's not the problem ..."
"Okay,"
"And if you're alienated,"
"I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems, that, you think this isn't sinking in."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I've seen more graduates from M I T"
"and that,"
Uh-huh.
"being,"
"I work in a, in a an Air Force laboratory"
"and so we've got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there"
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Even, even more so, uh, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too,"
"I, I mean I have to confess to that."
"Yeah,"
"it's sort of a, a rare select environment."
"Yeah,"
"and they have their own quirks and tolerances and, you know, certain things that don't bother us at all, that would drive other people nuts"
Yeah.
and then certain things that
"ways, things we do,"
"the way we do it that drive other people nuts that,"
"Right,"
"right,"
sure.
"But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world."
"It, it's a,"
"I, I have more I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh, degrees,"
Yeah.
It's a top rated institution
"and now I,"
"but they're undergrads are like,"
and they're pieces of junk.
I know.
"Still at it, hey."
"Yeah,"
"that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one."
Wow.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe they're getting better,"
"maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh,"
"Well, they got a three year lead time."
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so
"Yeah,"
that's just it.
"Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road."
"But, uh,"
The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time."
"And can you think of any other industry where in software they,"
"Uh,"
"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail ."
Yeah.
"Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade."
Yeah.
"It,"
"uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly"
"and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess."
Yeah.
"Uh, I don't know."
"And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity"
and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along.
"With,"
"I don't know,"
cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
"but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent"
and they get happy about money
and they just want to sue you.
Yeah.
"Well, yeah."
"That's,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And that's just, you know,"
you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
That's impossible.
"You know, you never know what they're going to get into."
I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
"and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire"
and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
"And that's the people that are working there, you know."
"And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know."
"Oh, that's horrible."
"Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper."
Huh.
"You know, just awful things."
And so I don't know.
I don't have kids
but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
"I mean, you just don't know."
"it wasn't forty-eight,"
"it was, it was, uh, let's see, yeah, it was forty-eight."
I was in the Air Force.
Uh-huh.
"We did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, Boone Greene, no out at, uh Andrews,"
Andrews?
yeah.
So what's it been like up there?
"Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet"
Uh-huh.
"but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry."
Yeah.
"Uh, like September was hot and dry,"
October.
"Um, September really was,"
I'm not sure about October.
"I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer."
Really?
Huh.
"It really has been strange here this year,"
"I mean, this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,"
"somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather,"
"but. Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,"
Uh-huh.
"and we had all this rain,"
"and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool."
"But all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in October, uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time."
"And, uh, then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, you know."
"There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal,"
"and then uh, into of November, the first, like the second week, uh, you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze,"
"He, he'll come home though, and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds,"
"and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything ."
"Uh-huh,"
"well I shot in the hundreds,"
but I made this one good one
"Yeah,"
"this one, on this one hole"
"Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way"
Uh-huh.
"those are, it's hard for me to, act nice about that when it goes on and on,"
"Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost."
Yes.
"Membership in the clubs is expensive,"
"the equipment is very expensive,"
"requires special shoes,"
"requires special, you know, special equipment."
"There's so many,"
"Right,"
"and then they want to play another course that's not, they're not a member of"
That's right.
and other fees.
"That's right,"
that's right.
It really is high.
"It can get very expensive,"
"and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
And they don't give those sessions away.
"And nor do they give, uh, instructions away."
Right.
As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.
"I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,"
"but not,"
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
"and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches."
Um
"At this time of the year,"
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
"and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer."
"Yeah,"
"well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas."
Right.
"But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,"
but we have our share of cold weather as well.
"The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing."
"It didn't stay there,"
"but it was right at,"
"Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?"
Um.
"We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,"
but this year it wasn't bad at all.
I guess that's because we had so much rain.
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
"He said it was just,"
"and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,"
"Oh, yeah."
"and, uh,"
"Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston"
"and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,"
"and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course."
"Oh, boy."
"They have a, uh, lake cabin"
Right.
Yeah.
"And I suspect it, in cases like,"
"I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil."
Is that right?
"Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage"
"and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
"I mean there are cases where they could be settled,  maybe  out of court a little more efficiently."
Right.
"But the lawyers are really, uh,"
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
"so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that."
But I am in favor of it for criminal cases
so there's a difference of my view there for those two.
Right.
Right.
"Yeah,"
well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that
Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
well I was called once when I was nineteen
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
"and, I was doing school and things like"
"they, they let me out."
Uh-huh.
I've never had to it since
"I really would like to have something like that,"
"and I'm hoping that by you know,"
"that's like, right now,"
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.
"But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features."
"Yeah,"
like what?
"Well, just like that air bag."
I think that thing is fantastic.
"Because I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things, when they had it and people walk away from it."
Yeah.
"We had one here,"
"I guess it was about three weeks ago,"
"and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises."
That's .
"did you see the, uh,"
"I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?"
Uh-huh.
Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over.
Uh-huh.
You got it.
"I, I, tell you what,"
"I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door."
that really
"I, I guess, I,"
"that, that a little more than scared me,"
"that irritated me, uh,"
"that,"
"because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open the lady would fall out,"
"I mean, and,"
"Well, you know what the average person,"
would you ever have thought of that?
"actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back."
"Yeah,"
But they're
"well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them,"
"at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it,"
uh-huh.
"but then that gas mileage was just atrocious,"
"I mean it's, unreal,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it just practically don't get any."
"Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the aerodynamic features,"
"you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage."
Yeah.
"And then, uh, he talked about a van,"
"and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these."
And another thing was
"that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car,"
but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But really and truly the safety features
"but I wouldn't get one that,"
"if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it."
Yeah.
Period.
"Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh, air bags in their, in their vans."
Oh that would be good.
"So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety,"
"I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, uh,"
"and I, I think it can go, ,"
"I'm not,"
"and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant"
Uh-huh.
"but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time."
Oh.
"And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city"
"but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign."
There's just not any push to recycle.
Huh.
"I recycle my newspapers and, uh, my aluminum stuff."
"Right,"
that's what I do.
"But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,"
it's not very convenient to do.
"Right,"
when they put centers and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans."
I don't know if you all have those things around.
Yes.
"And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,"
and you can just stop by.
"Now everything else like the uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers"
"but, but for aluminum that's real nice"
Uh-huh.
and I started doing that at work.
"Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,"
Uh-huh.
"and that's really helped a lot,"
"I mean, everybody's pitched in"
"and, you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can."
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"and, um, when, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out."
"Oh, I see."
"So, I'm still paying on all these accounts,"
but my accounts are closed.
Yeah.
"So, and I would prefer to keep it that way."
"Once we, once we're paid off um, I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa"
Uh-huh.
and that's it.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Actually I pay off my cards every month.
Only once in my life have I not paid.
"I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know."
"This, you buy what you can afford."
I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month"
"so that you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't do,"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"but, but yeah,"
"the, the thought of adding, you know, X percent to, to the price of what I buy, I just, I can't accept."
"Yeah,"
"and I, and I think at this, at this point in time with the economy the way it is, I think that, um, it's going to get even worse."
"Um, I'm, I'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off, now, um, you know,"
"we, only we started this last year"
"Uh-huh,"
I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
"Oh, that's right."
I work for a law firm
"I, I'm serious."
And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
Right.
"You know, if someone is"
Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
Well.
Plea bargaining is something completely different.
"That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up."
"Well, I know."
That's what I'm saying.
"But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard."
"I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they,"
I don't know how it works exactly
"but  you know, they get lesser sentences"
Right.
"and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something."
Right.
"But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it."
Huh.
you know what I'm saying?
"That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment."
Right.
"And, uh I, I think they should."
We do
"I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people"
"and, uh, you know, all"
Right.
"they, they're caught dead to rights."
"I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life"
"Well, I haven't counted."
"I, I would have guessed eight even"
but you might be right.
I don't have any idea.
"Well, I remember, uh, uh,"
"thinking, I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average."
"Maybe even a little more, a day or so more than the average."
Yeah.
"But, uh, government is ridiculous."
Wow.
Just think of the money they could save.
"I mean, they're, they're paying out this money anyway."
Yeah.
Why not get the work out of the people.
Yeah.
"And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes."
"But, uh, as far as income tax is concerned, I can't complain too much about it."
"Uh, I'm single,"
"I have no, uh, dependents or anything,"
my children are all grown
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes.
Yeah.
"Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is"
"and, you know, we're not typically talking about big dollars"
"but here you feel like you've, you've done something good"
"you've, you've earned your interest"
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it.
"So, the real amount of your savings on that is, is, not much."
"Uh, very true."
"That's,"
"You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there."
"And then they tell you to, uh, well, invest it in, uh, is it I R A or something"

= = = Iron Tank = = =
"Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy, known as in Japan, is a 1988 top-view action shooting game produced by SNK for the Nintendo Entertainment System."
"This video game is based on SNKs 1985 arcade game ""TNK III"" (which was released as ""TANK"" in Japan). Set during the invasion of Normandy, the player takes control of a commando named Paul and codenamed SNAKE (Colonel Ralf in the Japanese version, who also appeared in ""Ikari Warriors""), as he mans the titular Iron Tank to infiltrate the German stronghold. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in Australia."
"""Iron Tank"" is considered by some to be a spiritual successor to SNK's earlier game ""Guerilla War"" due to many similarities in gameplay, graphics and overall layout."
"The game opens with the titular tank landing on a beach, then advancing forward while fighting various enemies that include soldiers, officers, tanks of various types and fixed guns. In addition the player will have the opportunity to rescue captured soldiers (some of which give the player intel); and will have to negotiate various other obstacles and enemies such as armored trains, submarines, gunboats, land mines, airplane strafing runs, electric fences and gigantic rocket strikes."
"The tank is controlled by a standard NES controller: Directional buttons control the tank's movement, ""A"" fires the tank's machine-gun, ""B"" fires the main gun, ""Start"" pauses the game on the main screen, and ""Select"" opens the in-game menu. The turret can point in the standard 8 directions and is rotated by simultaneously pressing ""A"" and the desired direction. The turret will maintain its direction on the screen regardless of the tank's movements or facing and using this is part of the game's strategy."
"While in the game, pressing the ""Select"" button will open the in-game menu. From here, the player can activate or deactivate main gun fire options, read incoming radio messages, check progress on the game map and turn on the automated ""Refuel"" option. There are four main gun options, which when activated, alter the main gun's properties. They are:"
"While advancing through the game, the player will also come across power-up icons—red squares with a white letter in them. Some of the benefits from these include:"
"Like most NES action shooters, ""Iron Tank"" is divided into multiple levels, with bosses at the end of each. However, gameplay is continuous; there are no breaks between levels as the defeat of one boss directly leads to the start of the next level. One unique aspect that separates it from other action shooters is the ability of the player choose different paths to the final level by driving down the path of his choice. Some paths have fewer but more difficult levels, resulting in a shorter game if the player can successfully negotiate them while others are the reverse. The paths break and converge at specific points in the game's progress, allowing the player to mix and match level paths as the game progresses."
"The level bosses are various different, powerful weapons that include giant tanks, railway artillery, fortresses and grounded aircraft. Most have some degree of movement either in two directions—such as the railway gun, or freely around the screen like any of the several giant tanks. All of them have predictable movement and firing patterns and exploiting this is necessary to defeat them."

"August Thyssen (; Eschweiler, 17 May 1842 – Landsberg Castle, Ratingen, near Kettwig, 4 April 1926) was a German industrialist."
After he had completed his studies at the Politechnische Schule Karlsruhe and a commercial school at Antwerpen he like his brother Joseph Thyssen joined the bank of his father Friedrich Thyssen.
"In 1867 Thyssen and several members of his family founded the iron works ""Thyssen-Foussol & Co"" in Duisburg. When this company was dissolved in 1870, he used the new capital to establish with his father the ""Walzwerk Thyssen & Co"" that would become the base of an industrial empire in the industrialized Mülheim an der Ruhr, where the high of iron and steel prizes contributed to the making of his fortune. Initially he managed different companies separately in a decentralized fashion, but eventually he united them through a holding company. The largest company of his was the coal mining company ""Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser"" in Hamborn (now part of Duisburg) that he had acquired in 1891."
"He built the first 500-ton blast furnace in Germany, the first 100-ton Martin furnace, and the first large tube (iron pipe size) works. Together with Hugo Stinnes Thyssen was a cofounder of RWE."
"On 3 December 1872 in Mülheim an der Ruhr he married Hedwig Pelzer (1854–1940), daughter of Johann-Heinrich Pelzer and wife Hedwig Troost. They divorced in 1885. The four children during the marriage were Fritz, August, Heinrich and Hedwig. To avoid the possibility that his divorce would lead to a partitioning of his industrial empire, Thyssen transferred the property to his children, but retained the management rights for himself during his lifetime."
"The Thyssen conglomerate became the nucleus of Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, the biggest mining and steel cartel in the world, prior to World War II. Thyssen was refounded in 1953 and joined with KruppHoesch to become ThyssenKrupp AG in 1997."
"Thyssen purchased most of Beeckerwerth, including Haus Knipp, in the early 20th century."
"He was the first in his family to start acquiring a collection of works of art, including six pieces by his friend sculptor Auguste Rodin."
"Thyssen's firm was a vertically integrated company, controlling all aspects of the steelmaking process. He owned his own fleet of ships, a network of docks and a railroad. Although he was one of the richest men in Germany, to the day he died his ethos was ""If I rest, I rust."" He lived a simple life; he ran his empire from a dingy office in Mülheim, drove an old car, wore off-the-peg suits, and was known to drink and eat with his workers. He was also an ardent republican."
Thyssen died in 1926 of pneumonia following complications from eye surgery.

= = = Swaledale sheep = = =
"Swaledale is a breed of domestic sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of Swaledale in England. They are found throughout the more mountainous areas of Great Britain, but particularly in the Yorkshire Dales, County Durham, and around the pennine fells of Cumbria."
"Swaledales are noted for their off-white wool, curled horns and white around their nose and eyes. They are used for the production of lamb/mutton, the North of England Mule sheep, and as Pedigree breeding stock. Together with the Rough Fell, Herdwick, and Dalesbred sheep, they are one of the four variations associated with the English Lake District."
"Well suited to the exposed regions in which they predominantly live, the Swaledales are very hardy, thick coated, able bodied, and bold. The ewes make excellent mothers and are known for being able to rear lambs well, even in adverse conditions. They are of a medium build, with black faces marked with bright white around the nose and eyes, and both males and females grow curled horns, however the males horns are much larger. Their coats are thick and very coarse, and are considered a uniform white or off-white colour. The wool they produce, although durable, resilient and usable for a number of applications, is worth very little, with the British Wool Marketing Board paying approximately 40 pence per kilo of wool. The marketed fleece and fibre may contain kemp that is not white, so some yarns and prepared fibres from the Swaledale are grey. The sheep are also known for their tender and good-flavoured lamb and mutton."
"The Swaledales as a breed are related to Scottish Blackface and Rough Fell sheep, both of which are also predominant in upland locations in the United Kingdom and noted for their ability to thrive in exposed locations. Although the specific origins of the breed are unknown, a non-indigenous and exotic ancestor for the Swaledale was considered by two noted names of the eighteenth century, John Naismyth and Charles Findlater. Published in 1796, Naismyth's opinion in ""Young's Annals of Agriculture"" was that the origin of the black-faced highland breeds was ""impossible to trace"". Robert Trow-Smith in his book ""A History of British Livestock Husbandry, 1700–1900"" wrote: ""... it has already been suggested that this family stood outside the main stream of ancient British sheep..."" and that the root of the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds could be the Argali. This tenuous link between domestic sheep and the wild Argali has since been proved to be insupportable due to a significant difference in genetic make-up and number of chromosomes."
"Before the Swaledale, Scottish Blackface, and Rough Fell emerged as distinct breeds, their 17th-century forerunner was the Linton. It was named after the West Linton market in Peeblesshire, which specialised in selling the hardy Lintons for Scottish Highland and other upland farming. At the beginning of the 18th century, the market is recorded as having sold upwards of 9,000 sheep in a single day, numbers which surely helped establish the breed firmly in upland areas."
"The Swaledale Sheep Breeders Association was founded in 1919 and originally consisted of farmers living within a seven-mile radius of the Tan Hill Inn, on the North Yorkshire moors. The association is an active organisation point for Swaledale sales, shows, breeding, and products."
"There are approximately 1,200 flocks of pedigree Swaledale sheep in the United Kingdom. Fine pedigree tups (rams) sell for approximately £2,000 to £5,000 on average, though the highest price paid at auction for a prized ram was £101,000. Being a hardy breed, farmers are able to rear their Swaledale flocks in remote and exposed locations, generally without needing to provide indoor accommodation."
"The sheep produce commercially viable mutton and wool. Swaledale mutton has good flavour and tenderness. Wool colour and coarseness prevents Swaledale wool from fetching high prices, but its strong and durable properties make it suitable for carpets, rugs, and insulation. However, the wool is also used for spinning and knitting of clothing, though on a lesser scale to its other uses."
"The Swaledale sheep is an official symbol of the Yorkshire Dales. In 2003, plans were submitted to build a Swaledale sheep visitor centre in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, declaring Kirkby Stephen as the ""spiritual home of the Swaledale sheep"". These plans drew strong opposition from the town of Hawes, in Yorkshire, a strong competitor in terms of Swaledale sales, and which had its own plans for a visitor centre."
"A control flock of Swaledales has been used to study and develop scrapie-resistant sheep. An infectious, persistent, and spontaneous disease, animals infected with scrapie must be quarantined and destroyed. The experimental breeding involved selecting a group of Swaledale sheep with low suspectability to the disease, injecting them with the agents of the disease, and breeding from the survivors. The research has concluded that the offspring of the infected sheep are more able to survive scrapie."
"A commercially successful breed, the North of England Mule, has been produced from the Swaledale ewes, by mating with Bluefaced Leicesters. The offspring of this cross are now one of the most prolific lowland sheep."
"Swaledale cheese is an award-winning cheese that is manufactured in the Swaledale area, though not exclusively from sheep of this breed."

"""Missulena bradleyi,"" also known as the eastern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae. The spider is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia."
"William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Horton Burton Bradley (1845–1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the ""beautiful and strikingly marked"" specimen as a ""decided novelty"", Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders."
"Eastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets."
"The male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period."
The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an area where they live until a flap of silk indicative of the entrance is found.
"Common symptoms of eastern mouse spider bites are numbness and tingling at the bite site, sweating (diaphoresis), headache, and nausea generally. Although it appears to be the most dangerous member of the genus, serious envenomations by this species are relatively rare. Most bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom or involve serious symptoms. Their venom has been found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in Australian funnel-web spider venom, and Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has been found to be effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Compared to the Australian funnel-web spider, however, the eastern mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give ""dry"" bites."

"""Full Circle"" is the season finale for season six of the Canadian-American military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". It was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"".The episode was written by executive producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Martin Wood. The episodes received an average Nielsen household rating and a low syndication rating compared to other season six episodes. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide."
"""Full Circle"" follows the Ascended Daniel Jackson contacting Jack O'Neill and tells him that Anubis has located The Eye of Ra, an enormously powerful weapon that can defeat the combined forces of the Goa'uld System Lords. SG-1 then travels to Abydos to create a defensive position against the Goa'uld Army, Anubis then appears over the planet and threatens to destroy it if they don't give him The Eye of Ra."
"On Abydos, Skaara speaks with the Abydonian elders about Anubis, who will attack soon. In the middle of their council, Daniel appears, telling them that they will not fight alone. At the SGC, Col. O'Neill steps on an elevator, which malfunctions in the middle of the ride. Just as he tries to use the emergency phone, Daniel appears behind him and updates him on the situation with Anubis, who plans to get the ""Eye of Ra"" from Abydos, a key (along with five others) to using a super weapon. Jack demands to know why Daniel, with all the powers of the Ascended, can't stop Anubis himself, and Daniel tries to explain again what he is and is not allowed to do."
"Jack relays Daniel's intel to General Hammond and SG-1. When they ask where he got that kind of information, he reluctantly admits to seeing Daniel, and that it isn't the first time. No one seems terribly surprised to hear it, and Teal'c mentions that he, too, has seen Daniel. Hammond approves the mission, and SG-1 goes to Abydos where they meet up with Skaara, who brings them into an underground chamber, where they hope to find the Eye. While Sam and Jonas explore the chamber, Jack asks Skaara if he's seeing anyone, and Skaara tells him that he's betrothed. In the meantime, Anubis' mothership appears out of hyperspace and several ships fly to the pyramid, which is defended by Teal'c and a number of Abydonians. When the ships and ground troops attack, Teal'c radios Jack, who, irked by Daniel's absence, starts yelling for Daniel. Daniel appears and tries to say he still can't help, but Jack pushes him. Giving in, Daniel agrees to help Sam and Jonas figure out how to find the chamber while Jack and Ska'ara go above to assist Teal'c. Daniel, Major Carter, and Jonas open the chamber, full of artifacts, but not the Eye. In the pyramid, Skaara is mortally wounded while Jack and Teal'c fight valiantly to hold their ground. They are finally forced retreat to the underground chamber where Daniel concludes that the other ascended beings are Ancients. They discover a tablet, written in the language of the Ancients, which reveals information about a lost city of the Ancients. Daniel instructs Jonas to guard it with his life, then departs."
"Carter and Jonas find another secret chamber, which Sam shoots open, revealing the Eye. Jack and Teal'c, with Skaara, appear, bedraggled from the Jaffa onslaught. Their leader, Herak, confronts SG-1, demanding the Eye. Jack simply threatens to destroy the Eye. Herak returns to the ship and informs Anubis. As Herak departs, Daniel confronts Anubis, who reveals what he truly is, a partially ascended being. In space, a fleet of Ha'tak vessels appears and Yu contacts Anubis, threatening to destroy him. Daniel, on the other hand, offers Anubis a deal: he will bring him the Eye if Anubis promises to leave Abydos unharmed forever. The Goa'uld agrees. Daniel goes to SG-1, where he hears to his surprise that Skaara has died and ascended, realizing that Oma must be present. He advises the team of Anubis' partially ascended state: stuck between the mortal world and the ascended one. Anubis was thought dead but actually ascended. The Ancients, only accepting pure of heart among their ranks, de-ascended him but not completely. The shimmering energy that hides his true face keeps his form intact. He also informs them about his deal with Anubis because he wants SG-1 to find the lost city of the Ancients before Anubis can."
"O'Neill surrenders the Eye to Herak and the Jaffa leave. On the ship, Herak gives Anubis the Eye, and Anubis powers up a large weapon. It fires on Yu's ships and destroys many of them. The few left retreat, unable to penetrate Anubis' shields, with Lord Yu, also still alive. Anubis plans to destroy Abydos but Daniel appears and demands that Anubis stop. Anubis refuses, and goads Daniel into attacking him. Daniel attempts to use his ascended powers to destroy him. However, his attack is cut short, and he is spirited away by Oma Desala. Anubis, rid of his last obstacle, fires the superweapon at the pyramid on Abydos, where Jack is, and Jack slips through the event horizon of the Abydos Stargate and back to the SGC just in time. The planet Abydos is then destroyed."
"Back at SGC, SGC personnel attempt to dial back to Abydos, but they are unable to connect, and fear that Abydos has been obliterated by Anubis's superweapon. SG-1 continue to brief General Hammond about the situation and everything that transpired on Abydos. Carter and Walter continue dialing Abydos, as Carter refuses to believe that the planet is gone. Suddenly, after dozens of attempts, the Stargate establishes a wormhole to Abydos. Hammond allows SG-1 to return to Abydos to find out what has happened. SG-1 goes through the gate and discovers Skaara and his people. Astonished and yet relieved, SG-1 ask Skaara what happened. Skaara tells them that Oma helped all the Abydonian people around the planet ascend and that the people and the Stargate are only an illusion. Skaara sadly informs them that he has not heard anything about Daniel's fate. Suddenly, all the people disappear. Relieved that the Abydonians had not perished during Anubis's attack, SG-1 then returns to Earth."
"""Full Circle"" was written with the intention of being the last ""Stargate SG-1"" television episode, since the producers were already planning to release a ""Stargate"" film. When creating the Jaffa underlings for Anubis, the producers wanted to have something different. So, according to Joseph Mallozzi, they created ""Ninja""-like Jaffa."
"""Full Circle"" was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"". It is also the last episode to feature Corin Nemec (who portrayed Jonas Quinn) as a main cast member. It is also the last episode where Alexis Cruz (who portrayed Skaara) appears. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was therefore reduced to recurring status in season 7. Nemec welcomed the producers' openness for story pitches and offered several story ideas. He wrote the mid-season-7 episode ""Fallout"" and considered pitching more stories afterwards, but he became busy with other projects. Jonas is seldom mentioned in the series after this point but after Season 10's ""Counterstrike"" stated that the Ori conquered Jonas's homeworld, ""Stargate"" producer Joseph Mallozzi said in his blog that ""in [his] mind, Jonas went underground and is still alive somewhere, resisting the Ori army."""
"= = = Scatterville, Arkansas = = ="
"Scatterville is an unincorporated community in Clay County, Arkansas, United States, approximately 2 mi (3 km) northwest of Rector. All that is left of the community today is a cemetery. The community occupied a strategic location along Crowley's Ridge and was often referred to in the reports of Union and Confederate forces vying for control of Northeast Arkansas during the American Civil War."
"Scatterville was one of the first Clay County communities, defined by having five or six families settled in a five-mile (8 km) area. Scatterville received its name because:"
". . . one man put a store at the foot of a hill, another put one at the peak, still another put one at the foot on the other side. The few stores and cabins were scattered about over the hills in a careless way."
"The first families to locate in the Scatterville community were the McNiels, Allens, Copelands, Mobleys, Snowdens, Waddells, Nortens, Mitchells, Golbys, Whites, Bradshaws, Deans, Rayburns, Whitakers, and Simmons. They were mainly subsistence farmers; however, the Allen, Knight, Simmon, Bradshaw, McNiel, and Mobley families brought a few slaves with them when they emigrated from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cotton was grown during the antebellum period, but it was only used to make clothing for personal use. A gin in Scatterville eased this task somewhat by removing the seeds from the boll. After the war, cotton was raised as a cash crop. In 1855, the first horse-powered sawmill was brought to Scatterville, and a frame school building was erected in 1859. In that same year the town welcomed Major Rayburn's new steam-powered sawmill. Other industries in Scatterville included a tanyard for shoe making and a hand-powered sorghum mill. The community remained stable until the arrival of the St. Louis and Texas Railroad about two miles (3 km) to the south in 1881. The railroad company laid out a new town named Rector, and the population of Scatterville gradually migrated to the new and booming town."
"During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces operated in the area."
"On March 23, 1862, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""There are about 1,000 men at Gainesville and Scatterville, on Crowleys Ridge. They are badly armed and scattered, in order to subsist."""
"On March 24, 1863, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""From 400 to 700 of Jeffers and Clarks men are scattered along from Chalk Bluff to Scatterville and Gainesville."""
"On March 28, 1863, a detachment of the 1st Wisconison Cavalry Regiment passed through Scatterville in pursuit of a Confederate force under Col Preston, said to be in the area with 400 men."
"On July 21, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kitchens of the 10th Missouri Cavalry reported that a Union force of 350 was camped three miles south of Scatterville."
"On July 22, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kittchens again reported that the enemy (Union) had appeared in force in the neighborhood of Scatterville."
"Garde Church (, sometimes also Garda Church) is a medieval church in Garde on the Swedish island of Gotland. Built in stages during the Middle Ages, it retains much of its medieval character. It contains medieval frescos, some of which were probably executed by artists from present-day Russia. It lies in the Diocese of Visby."
"The remains of an early stave church were discovered at the site of the presently visible church during an excavation in 1968. In the vicinity, Christian graves from the Viking Age have also been discovered, still containing the clothes of the deceased. A number of picture stones, pre-dating Christian times, have also been uncovered in the church, where they were used by the earliest builders as building material."
"The first stone church was begun in the 1130s, remains of which are still preserved in the nave of the church, including a few still usable, carved stone benches, and the base of the tower. The tower was heightened during the 13th century to its present altitude. The choir is the most recent part of the church. It is from the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier, Romanesque choir with an apse. The construction of the new choir was planned as the first step in a major rebuilding scheme; however for one reason or another, the builders seem to have run out of funds and the rest of the plans were never executed - hence the somewhat unusual shape of the church. A similar fate is not uncommon for churches on Gotland, as the region suffered an economic downturn at the end of the Middle Ages."
"The church retains much of the ambience of the earliest churches on Gotland: it is rather dark, the windows are small, the ceiling is flat and wooden, and the portals narrow."
"One of the most distinguishing features of the interior are a number of wall paintings or frescos. They depict two saints and were probably executed by a Russian artist (possibly from Staraja Ladoga) as they are Russo-Byzantine in style. The church also has a baptismal font made by the anonymous sculptor Byzantios sometime during the middle of the 12th century, and a triumphal cross made in the 13th century. The altarpiece is Baroque in style, and locally crafted."

= = = La Haine (drama) = = =
"La Haine ""(Hatred)"" is a drama in five acts and eight tableaux by Victorien Sardou, premiered at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris on 3 December 1874. Jacques Offenbach, director of the theatre, composed extensive incidental music for chorus and orchestra to accompany the play."
"Offenbach had composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the Comédie Française in the early 1850s, gaining valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Sardou and Offenbach created their first joint work in 1872 with the opéra-bouffe-féerie ""Le Roi Carotte"", which ran for 195 performances, and this encouraged the two to renew their collaboration."
"By 1874, Jacques Offenbach had become the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté. To follow a revival of ""Orphée aux Enfers"" on 7 February, he decided to mount Sardou's drame using the under-used theatrical troupe at the theatre."
"""Orphée aux Enfers"" closed on the 18 November to allow the rehearsals for ""La Haine"" to start, directed by Sardou himself who did not spare his efforts. ""Le Figaro"" reported that ""Sardou is the most meticulous director in the world"" and that he ""places particular importance on the extras being actively involved as much as any of the actors."" Rehearsals increased and the dress rehearsal took place on 27 November."
"The premiere was announced for the 29 November, but was postponed on the day itself, due to the flu epidemic in the capital which indisposed two principal actors, Lafontaine et Clément Just. First of all it was postponed until 30 November but only took place on Thursday 3 December, but as the actors had not completely recovered, Sardou cut the final scene."
"The premiere audience marvelled at the magnificence of the production. The scenery was especially dazzling. Francisque Sarcey noted ""It is only right to recognize that, of the décors, several are masterpieces of exquisite taste; the cathedral dome is a marvel of lightness and grave; the inside of the church is superb."""
"Everything was done to dazzle : dramatist and composer went so far as to transport a Cavaillé-Coll organ into the theatre. The settings were grand and impressive: the stage accommodated 535 persons.: ""The war-cries of the soldiers, the moans of the terrified women, the clanking of armour, the booming of guns, the conquerors' entrance in the city, the sacking of the palace, all was of an exact and admirable motion."""
"The words of Victorien Sardou were also noted, but critics commented that the direction was rather against the drama. Francisque Sarcey regretted that the principal roles appeared crushed : ""The supernumeraries and props are too prominent. The crowd is the principal character. Tableaux follow tableaux, and in this new work, they are equally dark."""
"For Auguste Vitu the play evoked painful memories of 1870 : ""Streets full of bodies, palaces in flames, the homeland forsaken in the presence of the dumbfounded foreigner, and as if scandalized by so many distractions, such are the unforgettable sights which our consciousness is still soured, and of which our hearts still bleed. The widows and orphans in black, I have seen them bowed in our churches, the air rent with their sobs. The door of deathly memory re-opens wide within us; and sadness envelops us with its great black wings."""
"While receipts came to around 8,000 francs per performance in mid-December, they fell to around 5,000 francs during the second fortnight On 28 December ""Le Figaro"" printed a letter from Sardou requesting that Offenbach recall his piece from the stage; Offenbach replied that as the public prefer lively art he would bring back ""Orphée"". The announcement had the effect of filling the theatre for the last performances of ""La Haine"". After 27 performances the play closed on 29 December 1874 and ""Orphée aux Enfers"" was brought back. The short run left the theatre in a parlous financial position. Some costumes were used in the revised version of ""Geneviève de Brabant"" which opened on 25 February 1875."
"Despite the failure, Sardou and Offenbach did contemplate a further collaboration on a spectacular production of the playwright's ""Don Quichotte""."
"A modern performance with reduced text but complete score took place on 19 July 2009 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant and Gérard Depardieu playing Cordelia and Orso. The concert was broadcast on France Musique on 30 July 2009."
Guelph chiefs
In 2006 the autograph orchestral score of the incidental music was found in the archive of the Offenbach family.
Some early sketches preserved in the Archives Historiques de la ville de Cologne were destroyed in an accident on 3 March 2009.
"Jean-Christophe Keck, responsible for the 2009 critical edition, commented that ""Offenbach composed a rich score of 30 numbers. The first sketches were noted down while travelling in his barouche where he had set up a work-table - the manuscripts bear witness to the jumping pen as it rode over Parisian cobbles. It consists of many mélodrames, off-stage choruses, interludes...""."
"During Offenbach's tour of the USA, he conducted with much success the Marche religieuse from ""La Haine"" for American audiences."
"Keck notes that just before he died, Offenbach recalled the opening of the overture to ""La Haine"" in the opening bars of the finale of the Venetian act from ""Contes d'Hoffmann""."
"The action takes place in Siena in 1369. Historically, the Republic of Siena has passed through much civil unrest and political upheavals at that period, and in general Siena tended to be Ghibelline, in opposition to Florence's Guelph position. The play's specific events and its main characters are, however, fictional."
"In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the French Alps and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location."
"Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a gang rape, a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of World War II; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor."
"Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children."
"Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children. Francard comes back for Judith and the film ends as the room is seen empty."
"According to Christophe Gans, the film was shot both in French and English. The Canadian DVD has both cuts of the film."

"Chintila (; 606 – 20 December 639) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 636. He succeeded Sisenand in a time of weakness and reigned until his death."
"He was elected and confirmed by a convention of bishops and nobles in accordance with the 75th canon of the Fourth Council of Toledo. With his election, nothing changed and instability reigned. He never solved the many problems that plagued his time in office and, as the chroniclers of the age report, this included rebellions in Septimania and Gallaecia. In the three years of his reign, he permitted the bishops wide authority and they acted as monarchs ""de facto"", if not ""de jure""."
"He dedicated his time to councils, the Fifth Council of Toledo in June 636 and the Sixth Council of Toledo in June 638. These meetings covered many topics and legislated many new regulations."
"The king had to be chosen from among the nobility; never a ""tonsurado"" (cleric), member of the servile classes (peasants), or foreigners. They dictated the penalties for insurrection and determined that property acquired justly by the king could not be confiscated by his successor. Finally, they outlawed non-Catholics within the frontiers of the kingdom, which resulted in many forced conversions."
Chintila died in 639 or 640 of natural causes and was followed by his son Tulga.

"""Stargate Atlantis"" is a Canadian-American science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper as a spin off from its sister show, ""Stargate SG-1"". The series resumes the story of the ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"" episodes of ""SG-1"", where a military team led by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Major (now Lt. Colonel) Samantha Carter and the Jaffa Teal'c, use an ancient alien artifact called the Stargate to travel to different planets to explore and find new technology. The series pilot ""Rising"" takes place in the year 2004 after the events of ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"", when they finally find the lost city of the Ancients."
"""Stargate Atlantis"" premiered on July 16, 2004 on the channel Sci Fi Channel. The Sci Fi Channel would air all the five seasons made for the series. Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British and Canadian channels Sky One and The Movie Network aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. ""Stargate Atlantis""<nowiki>'</nowiki> finale episode premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The series finale was also the series' 100th episode. All five seasons of ""Stargate Atlantis"" are available on DVD. A direct-to-DVD film tentatively titled ""Stargate: Extinction"" was planned, but was later shelved."
"The cast of the first season consisted of Joe Flanigan starring as Maj. John Sheppard, David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay, Rachel Luttrell as Teyla Emmagan, Torri Higginson as Elizabeth Weir and Rainbow Sun Francks as First Lt. Aiden Ford. Aiden Ford was reduced to recurring character in season two and was replaced by Jason Momoa as the extraterrestrial human Ronon Dex in episode three of season two. Francks continued to have a recurring role in season 2, until his character's death (although this was not confirmed). After Torri Higginson's departure as a main character from ""Stargate Atlantis"" after Season 3, she was replaced by Amanda Tapping's Carter from the sister show. Paul McGillion, Robert Picardo and Jewel Staite were also main characters. McGillion became a main character in season two until season three as Carson Beckett, Picardo replaced Tapping as a main character as the new leader of the Atlantis expedition as Richard Woolsey for season five, and Staite portrayed Jennifer Keller as a main character in season five."

"Episodes in bold are continuous episodes, where the story spans over 2 or more episodes."
"The series picks up the story arc from ""Stargate SG-1""'s ""Lost City"", where people from all around the world come together to form an expedition and discover the wonders of Atlantis. Discovering that they have been cut off from Earth, they must fend for themselves, and discover a powerful new enemy bent on human subjugation."
"The story continues when the Daedalus arrives and renews the expedition's connection to Earth. This takes place alongside the Ori story arc in SG-1, and the Wraith become an even larger threat in the Pegasus Galaxy. But what they deal with in their second year might be more than they can handle, and Dr. Carson Beckett's retrovirus is more trouble than it's worth."
"This season concentrates on more character driven stories. Along with new insight on the characters, the expedition discovers a new threat, one that could be the precursor to the Replicators. Some important characters leave the series in this season, and the fate of Atlantis once again is in the hands of the humans from Earth."
"Amanda Tapping (Col. Samantha Carter) joined the cast as a regular for 14 episodes, Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) became a recurring character for eight episodes, while regular cast member Torri Higginson (Dr. Weir) became a recurring cast member for four episodes. The season started September 28, 2007, airing on the SCI FI channel in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the season premiered on Tuesday, October 9, 2007 on Sky One."
"After being a regular character in season four, Amanda Tapping (Colonel Samantha Carter) became a guest star in several episodes. Robert Picardo (Richard Woolsey) joined the cast as a permanent character as Woolsey assumes command of Atlantis. Actress Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) was promoted from a recurring character to a permanent cast member. Michael Shanks (Dr. Daniel Jackson) and Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett) appeared as guest stars in this season, with McGillion appearing in five episodes. Actress Torri Higginson had stated that she would not be reprising her role as Dr. Elizabeth Weir in the fifth season. Rainbow Sun Francks as Aiden Ford was given a brief cameo appearance in ""Search and Rescue"". This was the last season of Stargate Atlantis."
"After the August 20, 2008 announcement that Season 5 of Atlantis would be its last, it was announced the following day that the series would be continued with at least one direct-to-DVD movie. More movies were expected to follow in the ""Atlantis"" series if the first movie had been successful.

"Cohoes Falls [Kahon:ios, Mohawk for ""Canoe Falls""] is a waterfall on the Mohawk River shared by the city of Cohoes and the town of Waterford, New York, United States. Discovered by the indigenous people, the falls were called ""Ga-ha-oose"" or ""Ga-ho'n'-yoos"" by the Mohawks, which is believed to mean ""The Place of the Falling Canoe."" Cohoes historian Arthur Masten wrote in his 1880 history that the phrase might mean ""Potholes in the River,"" referring to the potholes that appear in the riverbed when it is dry. In the oral tradition of the ""Haudenosaunee"" (Iroquois), the Cohoes Falls are the site where The Great Peacemaker, performed a feat of supernatural strength, convincing the Mohawk people to become the founders of the Iroquois League of Nations or Confederacy. Some historians believe the Mohawks launched the Confederacy as early as 1142 CE, though other experts report dates ranging from 1450-1650."
"Celebrated by 18th-century travelers in letters and journals, the Cohoes Falls, also called The Great Falls of the Mohawk, were regarded as the second-most beautiful cataract in New York State after Niagara. In 1804, the national poet of Ireland, Thomas Moore, visited Cohoes and wrote a paean to the waterfall's beauty: ""Lines Written at the Cohos, or Falls of the Mohawk River."""
"In 1831, town leaders built a dam across the Mohawk River to harness the power of the falls to fuel the turbines of the city's burgeoning textile industry. Over the next several decades, the predominant company, Harmony Mills, became the largest manufacturer of cotton in the United States, thanks to its control of local water rights. When all the mills closed in the wake of the Great Depression, city leaders neglected the potential of the falls for tourism. They leased the flow rights to a series of power companies, including Niagara Mohawk and Orion Power."
"The Erie Canal was planned to overcome the navigational barrier of the Cohoes Falls. The original ""Clinton's Ditch"", the Erie Canal of 1825, was built through the city of Cohoes. The later Enlarged Canal was realigned, yet still went through the City of Cohoes. The Barge Canal, which opened in 1918, bypasses Cohoes and runs though the Village of Waterford via the Waterford Flight of Locks."
"The Cohoes Falls is 90 feet (28 m) high and 1,000 feet (305 m) wide. Its flow is most impressive in springtime, sometimes running at of water per second, but as the season changes, there is less water for the falls because so much of the flow is diverted at the Crescent Dam to the Barge Canal through Lock 6. Most of the water is still diverted for power generation; some is diverted for the Cohoes water supply. During the summer, the falls are virtually dry, revealing shale rock formations that have their own distinctive beauty. The 87-year average flow of the Mohawk River at Cohoes is 34,638 cubic feet per second, but this includes water diverted to the power plant and Erie Canal locks."

Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. The kingdom eventually fell apart after a succession struggle in 1862. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika."
"The Usambaras are approximately long and ranging from in width. They form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The range is one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots."
"The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east. The Usambaras are commonly split into two sub-ranges, the West Usambara Mountains and the East Usambara Mountains. The East Usambara are closer to the coast, receive more rainfall, and are significantly smaller than the West Usambara."
"The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and an old growth cloud rainforests."
"The West and East Usambaras are large ranges of Precambrian metamorphic geologic formations of acid-gneisses, pyroxenes, and amphiboles. These mountains were formed by faulting and uplifting creating the drainage system of troughs that form many watersheds, which provide water to a majority of the population of northeast Tanzania."
"The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot. There are many protected zones throughout the range, which are being expanded and contributed to by the Tanzanian government, associated NGO's and research teams, and donor countries such as Norway."
"Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl (""Bubo vosseleri""), the Usambara akalat (""Sheppardia montana""), the Usambara weaver (""Ploceus nicolli""), the African violet (""Saintpaulia ionantha""), the tree species ""Calodendrum eickii""."
"Historically the Usambara Mountains have been inhabited by the Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people who were a mix of agriculturalists and pastoralists."
"A Shambaa kingdom based on Vugu was founded by Mbegha in the first half of the 18th century. His grandson Kinyashi Muanga Ike gave the kingdom a stronger political and military structure. Under Kinyashi's son Kimweri ye Nyumbai the kingdom grew to cover both the west and east Usambaras, extending down to the coast and into the Pangani River valley to the south. After Kimweri died in 1862 the kingdom fell apart in a succession struggle."
"In the late 19th century when within the Usambara District of German East Africa, German colonialists came into the area bringing with them a mix of cash crops like lumber trees, coffee, tea, and quinine, and also designated forests as reserves for either water conservation or timber use. They also brought many new Western concepts, which often were diametrically opposed to traditional beliefs, such as coexistence with the forest versus forest as a ""separate wilderness"". The result of colonialism was a massive change in the way forests were perceived in the community, and conversion of traditional agriculture to cultivating cash crops such as quinine, pine trees, bananas, maize, tea, and coffee."
"In 1882 Adalbert Emil Walter Redliffe le Tanneux von St. Paul-Ilaire (known as Baron Walter), the Governor of the Usambara District of German East Africa, collected seed and plants of a small herb which were sent to Hermann Wendland, Director of the Berlin Royal Botanic Garden. Wendland cultivated the plants and recognized them as representing a new species in a new genus, ""Saintpaulia ionantha"", with the English common name African violet. In the generic name. Saintpaulia he recognized von St. Paul-Ilaire; the specific name he assigned means violet (Gr. ion) flower (Gr. anthos). In their native Usambara Mountains cloudforests, the plants are threatened with extinction."
Untersee (German: lower lake) may refer to:
= = = Gnadensee = = =
"The Gnadensee is part of Lower Lake Constance (), the western part of the lake."
The Gnadensee lies between Allensbach in the north and the island of Reichenau in the south. In the west it extends to the Mettnau peninsula (Radolfzell) and its eastern end borders on the Wollmatinger Ried Nature Reserve and the Reichenaudamm with its prominent avenue of poplars. The extremely small part in the northwest is called the Markelfinger Winkel. Together with the latter it has an area of 13 square kilometres. It reaches a maximum depth of 19 metres.
"The name of the Gnadensee probably dates to the period when the local judiciary was based on the island of Reichenau. If an accused person was found guilty and sentenced to death, the execution could not take place on the island. It had to be carried out on the mainland as the whole island was holy ground. As a result, the convict was taken by boat to the mainland in the direction of present-day Allensbach, in order that the sentence could be carried out. If the local ruler, the abbot, wanted to reprieve the criminal, he had a bell rung before the boat reached the far shore. This was a signal to the executioner on the mainland that the convict had received a pardon or ""Gnade"" (""mercy"" or ""grace"" in German)."
"Another explanation is that the name Gnadensee is derived from Mary, Mother of God, the ""Lady of our Grace"", and is an ellipsis of the word ""Gnaden[frau]see"" (""Lady of Grace Lake""), as the monastery in Mittelzell was dedicated to Saint Mary."

"Lake Zell (; ) is a small freshwater lake in the Austrian Alps. It takes its name from the city of Zell am See, which is located on a small delta protruding into the lake. The lake is long and wide. It is up to 73 metres deep and at an elevation of 750 metres above sea level."
"The lake is fed by numerous small mountain streams in summer, but only one stream flows out of it into the Salzach. In winter the lake completely freezes and is used for winter sports. In summer the lake is used for pleasure boating (boats powered by combustion engines are not allowed except for the ferries that cross the width of the lake from Zell to Thumersbach, so electrically powered boats can be rented instead). The water is very clear and suitable for swimming or diving, but can be chilly."
"The southern end of the lake, near Schüttdorf, is shallower and mostly filled with water weed, making it unsuitable for boating or swimming."

"The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA), a nonprofit museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, is the only major institution in North America devoted entirely to Russian art and culture from the entire scope of Russia's history. The Museum was founded by prominent art collectors Raymond and Susan Johnson, owners of the largest collection of Russian Realist paintings outside the borders of the former Soviet Union. TMORA was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2002, and opened at its present location in 2005. The museum shows 8-10 exhibitions per year, and hosts over 50 annual events ranging from notable lecturers to classical concerts to theatrical readings. TMORA is open daily, located between Downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport."
"Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an Honorary Consul for the Russian Federation in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions ""to international cultural diversity and education,"" both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens."
"In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a Congregational church and funeral home. The building received special recognition for adaptive reuse from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes of display galleries and administrative offices."
"The renovated gallery space has been host to over 70 exhibitions from Masterpieces of Soviet Era Painting, to historical topics like World War I and the Siege of Leningrad and Russian art forms such as Faberge, Lacquer Boxes, Nesting Dolls, and Ornaments. TMORA also presents shows by living artists, such as Leon Hushcha (a Minnesotan artist of Ukrainian descent) and Canadian-Armenian artist Garen Bedrossian."
"TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including Rossotrudnichestvo, the Russian Embassy in the United States - Washington D.C., the Russian Cultural Center, the State Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), State Russian Museum (St. Petersburg), State Museum of Yaroslaval (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States."

"As there are no known structures surviving from that period in the Scatterville vicinity, the Scatterville Cemetery is locally significant as the best surviving link to this important early Clay County settlement which faded from view in the post-railroad era. The Scatterville Cemetery comprises roughly two acres and is set in an impressive stand of largely oak and hickory trees. The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973."
"Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved. The inscriptions on many gravestones have been obscured by age and the elements while others were never inscribed. There are a few styled markers, including two four-sided family monuments with obelisks belonging to the Allen and McNiel families. Both were damaged by vandals; the Allen monument has been repaired, while the McNiel obelisk is lying in two parts beside its base. Nearby, the largest gravestone in the cemetery, the square-based, shaft and capital monument to Nancy McNiel, is in worse condition with its shaft lying on the ground and its capital broken into several pieces. There is also a multiple gravestone for three members of the Cook family. It is a tall rectangular monument with an upper-sloped face featuring a sculpted open Bible. Other interesting stones include H. W. Granade's 1870 horizontal cylindrical marker and Captain W. T. Morris's 1902 rectangular monument on base with an open Bible and a knotted stole draped down one side."

= = = Milky Way (mythology) = = =
"There are many myths and legends about the origin of the Milky Way, the crowd of stars that makes a distinctive bright streak across the night sky."
"Ancient Armenian mythology called the Milky Way the ""Straw Thief's Way"". According to legend, the god Vahagn stole some straw from the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along the way."
"The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way."
"A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (""Gili Ulisvsdanvyi"") ""Where the dog ran""."
"Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the ""Silvery River"" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the ""Seventh Night"" (, and )."
"In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor)."
"Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called ""The Pathway of the Birds"" (, ). The Finns observed that migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed ""Lintukoto"" (bird home) was."
"In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Ukko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter."
"The name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, )."
"In the Babylonian epic poem ""Enûma Eliš"", the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted."
"The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας ""Galaxias"") is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, ""gala""). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way."
"Another version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way."
"A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the ""Poeticon astronomicon"" (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), or Opis, the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way."
"In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called ""śiśumãra cakra"", the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called ""Akasaganga"" which means ""The Ganges River of the Sky""."
"According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk)."
"In Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was ""Bealach na Bó Finne"" — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as ""the Great Silver Yoke"" and the ""White Marrow of Fedlimid,"" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (""Mór-Chuing Argait"", ""Smir Find Fedlimthi"")."

"In the second part, hostilities have stabilized a bit. Arecibo and Quebradillas engaged in an exchange of baskets and this allowed the Pirates will mount in the notes field. Just when Quebradillas had approached 35 by 30, Arecibo reacted with a ""rally"" 7-0 and went away again. Despite this, the Pirates scored four goals in line and was in this way ended the first half. The score at that time favored by 42 Captains 34. Seconds before, Puruco Latimer, had to leave the party injured left shoulder."
"In the second half of the offensive game was rather slow for both quintets. Arecibo was the first to wake up with two triples and a field goal from Larry Ayuso. After that, Quebradillas answered with a push of 6-0. At that moment the game was 50 by 42 and was just as PJ Tucker received a technical foul. Both free throws were converted the technical foul for Larry Ayuso. Later, Peter John Ramos scored six points for the Pirates string and these were answered by seven consecutive Danny Santiago of Arecibo. After this exchange, both quintets baskets managed to finish the third set. The score reflected a clear advantage for the Captains of 62 by 52."
"The last ten minutes of action began with five goals of the Captains, but the Pirates were able to respond with their offense. Quebradillas was a ""rally"" of 8-0 and approached 66 to 60 on the scoreboard. In those moments when it seemed that resurface Quebradillas, the figure of Guillermo Diaz. He was lord and master of the show and made two free throws and hit a triple that sentenced the Pirates to defeat. Quebradillas failed to rise and so the clock expired, giving the Captains its fifth national title. The game ended with a score of 79 by 74."
"Top scorers for the Quebradillas team were: David Huertas with 26 and Peter John Ramos with 23. While on the Champions, as they were featured: Larry Ayuso with 22 and Danilo Pinnock had 18 points and 9 rebounds. Meanwhile, Guillermo Diaz scored 14 points and had the honor of being selected by the members of the press as the MVP of the Final Series"
"Capitanes de Arecibo win 2 straight Championships (2010, 2011) and their fourth championship in 7 years."
"The PBL began its third season in 2010 with nine teams. The Capitanes were one of three expansion teams. For PBL play, the Capitanes take the name of Puerto Rico rather than their home city. The Capitanes established two different talent pools. As well as the original BSN team, they had a roster for PBL play that included selections in that league's player draft. Their subsequent first signings were Andrés Rodríguez and Bonzi Wells. Other international players signed by the Capitanes during the off-season were Elías Larry Ayuso, Angelo Reyes and Walter Hodge. Antonio Látimer and José Rosario completed the signings, while Hodge left during the season to join the Cangrejeros. Their performance earned the team constant inclusion in MLN Sports' basketball rankings, debuting in the fourth spot. During the undefeated streak, David Rosario was named PBL Coach of the Month for January."
"The team won its first series against the Maryland GreenHawks, with scores of 109:100 and 99:91. The Capitanes subsequently won their first contests against the Manchester Millrats (116:104) and Vermont Frost Heaves (114:103), establishing a lead in the league's standings. The Capitanes' next game was against the team that held the second place in the standing, the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry (3-0), winning with scores of 101:94. The team won its first contests against the Buffalo Stampede (114:89), Halifax Rainmen (108:101) and Quebec Kebs (93:86). After two weeks of inactivity, the Capitanes began a series of away games defeating the GreenHawks 111:93. On March 21, 2010 the game between the Rainmen from Halifax and the Capitanes was played after the game had been canceled due to bad weather the previous time it had been scheduled. The score was 106:94, Capitanes."
"In March 2010, the PBL announced that it was forced to expel the franchise due to an alleged failure to adhere to its rules & guidelines. Among the violations cited were, failing to appear at road games, failure to pay amount owed to the league, and lack of communication with league officers. At the moment, the team held the second best record in the league and had secured a spot in the playoffs."
"The Capitanes responded by hiring one of Puerto Rico's top litigation attorneys, Lee Sepulvado of the law firm Sepulvado & Maldonado. The team's lawyers filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction before federal court in Puerto Rico. The PBL hired O'Neill & Borges, one of Puerto Rico's top law firms and was represented by attorney Salvador Antonetti Stutts whom attended Harvard Law School and is a former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico."
After the attorneys conducted oral arguments before Federal Judge Juan Perez Gimenez the court entered a temporary restraining order against the PBL instructing the league to immediately reinstate the Capitanes and allow them to participate in the 2010 playoffs. Shortly thereafter the PBL agreed to the issuance of a preliminary injunction order formally reinstating the team.
The matter received extensive media coverage and the PBL was forced to accept its wrongdoing by setting aside the expulsion of the team. The Capitanes vehemently denied the charges and all along insisted their only goal was to win in the basketball court and not the legal court.
"As runners-up of the 2007 BSN season, the Capitanes were selected to represent Puerto Rico in the first edition of the FIBA Americas League, along with the BSN-champion Santurce Crabbers. Before the competition began, the Capitanes' coach, David Rosario, stated that the team's preparation was intense so that they would be able to adapt in order to match the advantage expected to be presented by Fuerza Regia and Halcones Xalapa, since the tournament occurred in the middle of the ""Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional"" season."

= = = Maryland Route 175 = = =
"Maryland Route 175 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from Little Patuxent Parkway in Columbia east to MD 3 in Millersville. MD 175 is a major highway through the large unincorporated community of Columbia; the highway connects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) next to Columbia Town Center with Interstate 95 (I-95) and an industrial area on the eastern side of Howard County. MD 175 also connects Fort Meade with Jessup and Odenton in western Anne Arundel County, where it links MD 295 and MD 32 with the eastern part of the U.S. Army base."
"MD 175 was constructed from Ellicott City to Millersville in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of three routes: MD 531 from MD 103 near Ellicott City to US 1 near Jessup, MD 175 from there to Fort Meade and north to Hanover, and MD 180 from Odenton to Millersville. The highway did not originally extend through Fort Meade; MD 175 was constructed through the military installation in the early 1940s as part of major upgrades to the highway from Jessup to Odenton due to its strategic importance. By 1946, MD 175 extended from Ellicott City to Millersville. The highway was widened from Odenton to Millersville in the late 1940s and from Ellicott City to Odenton in the mid-1950s. MD 175 was relocated at I-95 around 1970 and as a major highway through the newly constructed community of Columbia in the mid-1970s. The old portion of the highway from Ellicott City to the new highway became MD 108 and MD 104. There are plans to expand MD 175 to a multi-lane divided highway through Fort Meade due to increased activity at the Army post."
"MD 175 begins just west of its bridges over the Little Patuxent River. The highway continues southwest as Little Patuxent Parkway, the county-maintained six-lane divided highway that forms the main street of Columbia Town Center. MD 175 heads east as Rouse Parkway, a four-lane divided controlled access highway; the highway was renamed from Little Patuxent Parkway to honor Columbia founder James Rouse and his wife Patty in 2006. The highway immediately has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). MD 175 heads southeast through intersections with Thunder Hill Road, Tamar Drive, and Dobbin Road as it passes between the Columbia villages of Oakland Mills to the southwest and Long Reach to the northeast. The state highway expands to six lanes at Dobbin Road and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Snowden River Parkway that provides access to a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and a trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive. Access from eastbound MD 175 to Columbia Gateway Drive requires using the Snowden River Parkway interchange. MD 175 widens to eight lanes at Columbia Gateway Drive, a width the highway carries through its intersection with the eastern end of MD 108 (Waterloo Road) to the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway's name changes from Rouse Parkway to Waterloo Road at the MD 108 junction. MD 175 has six lanes from I-95 to east of its junction with US 1 (Washington Boulevard), which was the site of a tavern called Waterloo and before that Spurrier's Tavern."
"MD 175 narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it passes between the Maryland Wholesale Produce Distribution Center to the southwest and the Patuxent Institution on the northeast and enters Jessup. East of Dorsey Run Road, which leads to the Jessup Auto Distribution Center, the state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision and enters Anne Arundel County, where the highway's name changes to Jessup Road. East of the tracks, MD 175 meets the eastern end of unsigned MD 723 (Old Jessup Road), which accesses the Jessup station on MARC's Camden Line, which uses the Capital Subdivision tracks. The highway continues east past the former Maryland House of Correction and has a cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), where the highway's name becomes Annapolis Road. MD 175 temporarily expands to four lanes at its intersection with MD 713, which heads south as Rockenbach Road into Fort Meade and north as Ridge Road toward Hanover. The highway passes through the eastern part of Fort Meade and expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane at Reece Road, which becomes MD 174 on the eastern boundary of the military installation."
"At the southeastern corner of the fort, MD 175 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway) and enters Odenton. The highway crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and meets the southern end of MD 170 (Telegraph Road); the south leg of the intersection, Piney Orchard Parkway, leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line, which uses the Amtrak tracks. MD 175 continues as a four-lane undivided highway to a five-legged roundabout at the eastern end of Odenton where the highway meets Odenton Road, Higgins Drive, and Sappington Station Road, which is unsigned MD 32AA. The highway continues as a two-lane undivided road past Arundel High School and through the village of Gambrills before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) west of Millersville. MD 175 has separate intersections with southbound and northbound MD 3; Millersville Road continues east from the northbound intersection through the eponymous village and past the historic Childs Residence."
MD 175 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal freight transport connector from I-95 to Dorsey Run Road in Jessup and as a principal arterial from US 29 to I-95 through Columbia.
"The first section of MD 175 was constructed between 1924 and 1926 as a macadam road from US 1 southeast to the entrance of the Maryland House of Correction east of the B&O Railroad (now CSX) in Jessup. MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929. The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930. The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932. The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II."
"MD 180's crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed in 1938. The highway was relocated through Odenton using the new bridge in 1938 and 1939; the old road became MD 677. MD 175's bridge over the B&O Railroad in Jessup was completed in 1942. The highway was widened to a wide road with a concrete base and asphalt surface from Jessup to the MD 713 intersection in 1942. MD 175 was also extended as a road through Fort Meade from MD 713 to west of Odenton between 1942 and 1944. By 1946, MD 175 had been extended east over MD 180 to Millersville and west over MD 531 to Ellicott City; the portion of MD 175 from Fort Meade to MD 176 became MD 713. MD 175 was widened from from Odenton to Millersville starting in 1948. The highway was widened and resurfaced from Odenton to the newly constructed Baltimore–Washington Expressway interchange in 1954. MD 175 was also widened with curve amelioration from US 1 to MD 103 between 1954 and 1956."
"MD 175's first divided highway section was created when the highway was relocated from US 1 to just north of the modern MD 108 intersection in conjunction with the construction of the I-95 interchange in 1969 and 1970. The state highway's interchange with US 29 in Columbia was built in several stages. The westbound and eastbound bridges across the Little Patuxent River were built in 1970 and 1974, respectively. The first parts of the interchange to open were the ramps between county-maintained Little Patuxent Parkway and southbound US 29. MD 175's bridges over US 29 were built in 1974. The interchange fully opened when the new Little Patuxent Parkway was completed from the existing highway at the present MD 108 interchange west to US 29 in 1977. The portion of MD 175 north of the new highway was replaced by an eastward extension of MD 108 and MD 104. The highway's trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive opened with Little Patuxent Parkway. MD 175 was two lanes from US 29 to Columbia Gateway Drive until the road was expanded to a divided highway in 1987. The highway's interchange with Snowden River Parkway was constructed in 2001. MD 175's roundabout in Odenton was installed in 2004."
"The Maryland State Highway Administration plans to upgrade MD 175 from MD 295 in Jessup east to MD 170 in Odenton in response to the greatly increased traffic destined for Fort Meade due to the Base Realignment and Closure process. The state plans to expand MD 175 to a six-lane divided highway along the stretch, construct intersection improvements at MD 713, Reece Road, Mapes Road, and Charter Oaks Boulevard, and reconstruct the MD 295 interchange. One of the first projects to begin construction is improvements at the MD 713 intersection, which started in 2011 and are expected to be completed in 2013."

"Microsoft RPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) is a modified version of DCE/RPC. Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) strings, implicit handles, and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC."
"The DCE 1.0 reference implementation only allows such constructs as ""size_is(len)"", or possibly ""size_is(len-1)"". MSRPC allows much more complex constructs such as ""size_is(len / 2 - 1)"" and even ""length_is ((max & ~0x7) + 0x7)"", a common expression in DCOM IDL files."
"MSRPC was used by Microsoft to seamlessly create a client/server model in Windows NT, with very little effort. For example, the Windows Server domains protocols are entirely MSRPC based, as is Microsoft's DNS administrative tool. Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5's administrative front-ends are all MSRPC client/server applications, and its MAPI was made more secure by ""proxying"" MAPI over a set of simple MSRPC functions that enable encryption at the MSRPC layer without involving the MAPI protocol."
"MSRPC is derived from the Distributed Computing Environment 1.2 reference implementation from the Open Software Foundation, but has been copyrighted by Microsoft. DCE/RPC was originally commissioned by the Open Software Foundation, an industry consortium to set vendor- and technology-neutral open standards for computing infrastructure. None of the Unix vendors (now represented by the Open Group), wanted to use the complex DCE or such components as DCE/RPC at the time."
"Microsoft's Component Object Model is based heavily on MSRPC, adding interfaces and inheritance. The marshalling semantics of DCE/RPC are used to serialize method calls and results between processes with separate address spaces, albeit COM did not initially allow network calls between different machines."
"The Chinatown stop is located on George Street, north of Campbell Street. It is named after Sydney's Chinatown precinct. The Capitol Square stop on the Dulwich Hill Line is nearby. The design was to include two side platforms, but was changed to an island platform in the project's Submissions Report. The location was also moved 15 metres north."
"The Haymarket stop, known as Rawson Place during development, serves as an interchange for buses heading towards the west via Broadway. The design includes two side platforms for trams and an adjacent platform for buses, which allows bus – tram cross-platform transfers."
"The Central Chalmers Street stop is located on Chalmers Street, serving the eastern side of the Central railway station precinct. The stop was originally known simply as Central during development, but was renamed to distinguish it from the existing Central stop on the Dulwich Hill Line at the station's Grand Concourse. The new stop consists of one side platform and one island platform."
"The stop was originally proposed to consist of three double length (90 metre) platforms, with one of the platforms to only be used during special events - the roadway being open to general traffic at other times. This third platform was removed in the project's Submissions Report, with a crossover to the north of the stop provided instead. The Report also proposed diverting most general traffic via Randle Street and converting the section of Chalmers Street opposite the station into a pedestrian/traffic shared zone. As a result of the December 2014 decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during special events at Moore Park were abandoned. Consequently, the Modifications Report reduced the platform length from 90 metres to 75 metres. The third platform was reinstated in an urban design plan released in 2017. This report also proposed closing Chalmers Street to through traffic."
"The Surry Hills stop is located on Devonshire Street, adjacent to Ward Park in Surry Hills. The design originally featured an island platform but was changed to side platforms in the project's Submissions Report. Groundwork for a second Surry Hills stop at Wimbo Park for a potential future station if required will be completed in the initial construction phase."
"The Moore Park stop serves the Moore Park precinct. In regular service the stop serves Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School and The Entertainment Quarter. The stop is also designed to handle major events at the New Sydney Football Stadium and Sydney Cricket Ground, with grade separated access to the platform. At-grade access to the stop will be provided for regular use and for disabled passengers during major events. The design features a 75-metre island platform."
"The stop's design experienced a number of modifications. Initially, an overhead concourse was proposed for access to the stop during special events with at-grade access at other times. School students would have used the existing footpath and pedestrian crossing of Anzac Parade."
"In the project's Submissions Report, the stop was moved 250 metres south and a pedestrian bridge over Anzac Parade and the light rail tracks was included in the design, replacing an existing at-grade crossing of the road and an associated set of traffic lights. The bridge was to be connected to the concourse. In December 2014, the overhead concourse was removed, with underground access for major events provided at both ends of the platform. At-grade access will be used by disabled passengers during major events and by all passengers at other times. The bridge will now be a separate structure. As a result of the decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during major events were abandoned. Consequently, the platform length was reduced from 90 metres to 75 metres."
"Community submissions responding to the changes in the Modifications Report raised concerns about the safety of a large number of school students crossing the tracks during peak schools hours. In response, TfNSW stated that it will consider opening the subways during these hours. A condition of approval for the changes proposed in the Modifications Report requires the preparation of ""a safety case demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, that schoolchildren can safely access the Moore Park stop during peak school start and finish times""."
"Royal Randwick, known as Alison Road and then Royal Randwick Racecourse during development, is located on existing park land adjacent to Centennial Park on Alison Road, opposite the racecourse. This required the construction of a new retaining wall approximately 200 metres long and three metres high together with increasing the height of an existing 1,100-metre long levee by up to 300 millimetres and the removal of approximately 50 established trees."
"The design features an island platform. The proposed location was switched from the south side to the north side of Alison Road in December 2014. This is intended to reduce impacts on the racecourse, improve bus access during major events and provide better access to the nearby Centennial Park and Randwick TAFE. This change includes the removal of right turn access from Alison Road into Darley Road."
"The Wansey Road stop is located on Alison Road, adjacent to the intersection with Wansey Road. The design features an island platform and was originally to be located on Wansey Road itself, but was moved to Alison Road in the project's Submissions Report. The stop was originally proposed to be named Wansey Stables."
"The UNSW High Street stop serves the north-eastern part of the University of New South Wales campus. It was to have been located at the southern end of Wansey Road, adjacent to High Street, but was moved onto High Street itself as part of the project's Submissions Report. As part of the changes to the Randwick stop, the design was changed from an island platform to two side platforms."
"The Randwick stop is located the eastern end of High Street in Randwick. The stop was originally proposed to be named Randwick Junction. The design features an island platform. The site will be a major interchange between buses and light rail. Bus stops are proposed for Belmore Road, Avoca Street and Clara Street."
"The original design featured two side platforms located in High Cross Park adjacent to Belmore Road. This location attracted criticism from community members due to loss of trees and parkland. The stop was redesigned in the project's Submissions Report to reduce the loss of green space in the park, however a campaign to move the stop continued. Randwick City Council requested the stop be moved to High Street, outside the Prince of Wales Hospital and TfNSW ultimately agreed to do this. A location within High Cross Park was considered to provide the best interchanges between trams and buses."

"LSI conducts Quick Counts during General Elections and District Head Elections (Pilkada.) The vast and geographical nature of Indonesia tend to cause delayed announcements of election results—typically, those results can only be known around 2 weeks or even 1 month after the election. Once, people required a significant amount of time in order to finding out the victors of such elections, and this can cause a less than conducive atmosphere on the political situation on areas where those elections are held. Participants of the elections may take numerous visits to the office The General Election Commission (KPU) demanding the results—visits that are often accompanied with violence and demonstration, which in turn will cause a domino effect on the stability of the region (either economically or socially.) These undesirable possibilities of outcomes can be mitigated by using Quick Count: a rapid counting method using scientifically collected results from voting locations (TPS) during elections Done correctly, Quick Count can achieve a result with less than 1% margin of error compared to the official results announced by the General Election Commission (KPU). Through Quick Count, result calculation can be finished very rapidly—at the very least, only 4 hours after the votes are officially collected and counted the results can already be summarized and concluded."
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted hundreds of Quick Counts and made the results available via press conferences and national television channels TV One and Metro TV. The Indonesia Museum of Record (MURI) gifted LSI with various awards such as (1) The Quick Count Accuracy for Sumbawa Election on November 2010 with 0% margin of error when compared to official results. . Before that record, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia has also achieved a record for Quick Count results for the District Head Election on East Tanjung Jabung, Jambi, with only 0.05% difference when compared to the official results (2) The Fastest Announced Accurate Quick Count results (1 hour post voting period ends) on 2009 Presidential Election. This Quick Count was broadcast live by TV One. (3) The first 100 times successively accurate Quick Count results"

Quick Poll is a quick survey of public opinion. The main point of difference is that the interview is not done face to face but rather by utilizing handsets connected to all selected respondents. In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents’ characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible—from job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes not only the selected respondent but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the selected respondent a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset—all answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it."

"Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990) was an American civil rights lawyer. He worked for the Department of Justice in the 1930s and 1940s, where as director of the alien enemy control unit he oversaw the Japanese American internment. He contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union's efforts to fight the internment, and after World War II resigned from the Department of Justice to join the ACLU, where he rose up through the organization and eventually served as its president from 1969 to 1976."
"Ennis graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1932, and went on to work for the Department of Justice for fourteen years. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild in the 1930s, but withdrew from the organization, believing it to be under the influence of Communists. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign travel control. His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States."
"In 1946, Ennis did resign from the Department of Justice, and joined the board of the ACLU himself. He became the ACLU's general counsel in 1955, and was elected chairman of the ACLU in 1969, succeeding Ernest Angell who was retiring after 19 years with the organization. He served as ACLU president until 1976, during which time he called for the resignation of President Richard Nixon and an end to the property tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. Notwithstanding the former, he was critical of the zealousness of opposition to Nixon shown by Charles Morgan, Jr. of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office. He was succeeded as ACLU president by Norman Dorsen. He remained a member of the ACLU executive committee until 1985."

= = = Quaker Oats Company = = =
"The Quaker Oats Company, known as Quaker, is an American food conglomerate based in Chicago. It has been owned by PepsiCo since 2001."
Quaker Oats was founded in 1901 by the merger of four oat mills:
"The company expanded into numerous areas, including other breakfast cereals and other food and drink products, and even into unrelated fields such as toys."
"Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant."
"During World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, which manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of total 280,800 ft² were built)."
"In 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois. This plant currently makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants."
"In 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company and spun it off in 1991."
"In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", obtaining in return a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for candy bars."
"In 1982 Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998."
"In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade."
"Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group."
"In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004)."
"In August 2001, Pepsico acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion dollars."
"The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as ""The Electric City"" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent–Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire."
"When PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the ""manufactured by"" address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility exports to the majority of Canada and limited portions of the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets."
"Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called ""Liberty Park"". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the ""oatmeal lots"". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a ""general foreclosure"" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant."
"In 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike."
"The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word ""Pure"" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn, the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker. Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the ""Quaker man"" as William Penn, and referred to him as ""standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats."""
"In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look. The man is now sometimes referred to as ""Larry"" by insiders at Quaker Oats."
"And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: ""Nothing is better for thee, than me""."
"The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo ""does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength."""
"The company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). ""The Straight Dope"" writes ""According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877."""
"Members of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation. In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a ""Quakerman"" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto. Later that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal."
"From 1946-1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ""Science Club"" and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997."
"In 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat, yet their packaging featured claims like ""heart healthy,"" ""wholesome,"" and ""smart choices made easy."""

"BroadR-Reach technology is an Ethernet physical layer standard designed for use in automotive connectivity applications. BroadR-Reach technology allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cable. Benefits for automotive manufacturers integrating the BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard include reduced connectivity costs and cabling weight, according to Broadcom Corporation, now Broadcom Limited, inventor of the BroadR-Reach standard."
"Using BroadR-Reach technology in automotive enables the migration from multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view parking assistance, rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive-qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective."
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit and receive (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements."
"The OPEN Alliance SIG is a special interest group formed by BMW, Broadcom, Freescale, Harman, Hyundai, NXP and STMicroelectronics to establish BroadR-Reach as an open standard and to encourage wide scale adoption of automotive Ethernet as the connectivity standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception in late 2011, membership has reached more than 140 members as of May 31, 2013."
IEEE 802.3 has standardized 100BASE-T1 in IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96.
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard was officially released in December 2011, following the formation of The OPEN (One-Pair Ether-Net) Alliance Special Interest Group (SIG) (OPEN Alliance SIG). License to the specification for BroadR-Reach is available to all interested OPEN Alliance SIG members under RAND terms via a license from Broadcom Corporation."

The greeting made can include a number of gestures including a nod, a pointed finger, palm-out V sign, or an actual raised-hand wave."
Motorcyclists may use specialized hand signals to both greet and warn oncoming riders:
"The use of specific gestures may be culturally or regionally dependent. Some observers have commented that waving is common amongst riders in North America but uncommon in some European countries, like Germany."
"French riders will stick their foot out when overtaking another motorcycle, and while lane splitting when a car facilitates it.. In Britain, vehicles drive on the left hand side of the road, and so bikers will most commonly give eachother a nod, rather than releasing the throttle to wave, or waving with the clutch hand which would likely be difficult to see."

"Country Place is a residential neighbourhood near the geographical centre of Ottawa, Canada and part of the former city of Nepean. It is a mature residential subdivision with about 400 houses located just inside the Ottawa greenbelt near the Rideau River, and about 11 km from downtown Ottawa. It is bordered by the Black Rapids Creek and the greenbelt to the south, Prince of Wales Drive to the east, Merivale Road to the west, and the Pineglen community to the north. Amberwood Crescent meanders through the community, exiting onto Prince of Wales and Merivale. Tennyson Drive links Country Place to Pineglen."
Houses in Country Place were built mostly in the early 1970s and are similar in size and design. The only exceptions are houses on Campfield Ct. which was built in the 1980s on land that had originally been set aside for a possible school.
"The community has an active community association that runs events several times a year, maintains an outdoor rink in the winter, and helps promote the interests of the residents. Country Place is within the Knoxdale-Merivale Ward of the City of Ottawa."
"The prisoners were permitted brief daily exercise in an enclosed garden. However, the windows to their rooms were painted over and they were kept in isolation from the outside. A high wooden fence was built around the outer perimeter of the house, closing it off from the street."
"About midnight on 16–17 July 1918, Commander Yurovsky entered the second-floor room of Dr. Botkin, who was awake and writing a letter. Botkin was told to awaken the Imperial family and their three remaining servants, so that the whole party could be evacuated from Yekaterinburg. The reason given was that the anti-Bolshevik White Army forces of Tsarist and moderate democratic socialists in the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1918–1921, were nearing the city and that there had been firing in the streets."
"After taking about half an hour to dress and pack, the Romanovs, Botkin and the three servants were led down a flight of stairs into the courtyard of the house, and from there through a ground-floor entrance to a small semi-basement room at the back of the building. Chairs were brought for Tsarevich Alexei and Tsarina Alexandra at the Tsar's request. The remainder of the party stood behind and to one side of the seated pair."
"After a while, Yurovsky and a party of armed men entered the basement room through the double doors. Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, G. P. Nikulin, M. A. Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, S. P. Vaganov, A. G. Kabanov, P. S. Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. Three Latvians refused at the last minute to take part in the execution."
"Yurovsky spoke briefly to the effect that their Romanov relatives had attempted to save the Imperial family, that this attempt had failed and that the Soviets were now obliged to shoot them all. He and his squad then opened fire with pistols on the prisoners."
"The number of people crowded into a comparatively small area led to an inefficient and messy slaughter. The women among the prisoners had diamonds and jewelry concealed in their clothing, deflecting many of the bullets. It took between twenty and thirty minutes before all were killed."
"As early as 1923, the photographs of the fenced house were disseminated in the Soviet press under the label of ""the last palace of the last Tsar"". In 1927, the house was designated a branch of the Ural Revolution Museum. It then became an agricultural school before taking on new life in 1938 as an anti-religious museum. During this period it was customary for party apparatchiks to arrive in large tour groups, posing before the bullet-damaged wall of the cellar in which the former Tsar and his family had been murdered. In 1946, it was taken over by the local Communist Party. In 1974, it was formally listed as a Historical-Revolutionary Monument. However, to the embarrassment of the government, it was steadily becoming a place of pilgrimage for those who wished to honour the memory of the imperial family."
"In 1977, as the sixtieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution approached, the Politburo decided to take action, declaring that the house was not of ""sufficient historical significance"", and ordering its demolition. The task was passed to Boris Yeltsin, chair of the local party, who had the house demolished in September 1977. He later wrote in his memoirs, published in 1990, that ""sooner or later we will be ashamed of this piece of barbarism."" However, despite this action, the pilgrims kept coming, often in secret and at night, leaving tokens of remembrance on the vacant site. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union that was complete by 1991, the Church on the Blood was built on the part of the site and is now a major place of pilgrimage."
"On one side of the church, there's an orthodox cross which marks the location of the Romanov family’s death. Even during the Soviet Era, there were crosses in that area, but it changed over time. Different crosses would be replaced by a new one as the years went by. A small wooden structure was eventually built behind the cross and still stands near the church today; it can be seen in the picture on the right."
"The house features as the setting for two plays: ""Ekaterinburg"" (the title being an alternate romanization of Yekaterinburg) and ""The House of Special Purpose"" (Heidi Thomas, 2009). Both plays deal with the time in captivity spent inside the Ipatiev House by the Romanovs and their retainers."
= = = DIN sync = = =
"The DIN sync standard, also called Sync24, defines a synchronization interface for electronic musical instruments."
"DIN sync was introduced in the early 1980s by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, arpeggiators and similar devices. It has since been superseded by MIDI, in the mid to late 1980s. The DIN sync standard consists of two signals, clock (tempo) and run/stop. Both signals are TTL compatible, meaning the low state is 0 V and the high state is about +5 V."
"The clock signal is a low-frequency pulse wave suggesting the tempo. Instead of measuring the waveform's frequency, the machine receiving the signal merely has to count the number of pulses to work out when to increment its position in the music. Roland equipment uses 24 pulses per quarter note, known as Sync24. Therefore, a Roland compatible device playing sixteenth notes would have to advance to the next note every time it receives 6 pulses. Korg equipment uses 48 pulses per quarter note."
The run/stop signal indicates whether the sequence is playing or not.
"The DIN sync standard is so named because it uses 5-pin DIN connectors, the same as used for MIDI. DIN sync itself is not a DIN standard. Note that despite using the same connectors as MIDI, it uses different pins on these connectors (1, 2, and 3 rather than MIDI's 2, 4 and 5), so a cable made specifically for MIDI will not necessarily have the pins required for DIN sync physically connected via wires. In some applications the remaining pins (4 and 5) are used as ""tap"", ""fill in"" or ""reset and start"", but this differs from one device to another."
"If a device is a DIN sync sender, the positive slope of start/stop must reset the clock signal, and the clock signal must start with a delay of 9 ms."
"A detailed description on how to implement a DIN sync sender with Play, Pause, Continue and Stop functionality was published by E-RM Erfindungsbuero."
"The MIDI interface uses the same 5-pin DIN connectors, but is electrically not compatible with DIN sync. The MIDI protocol features a MIDI beat clock. MIDI beat clock also works with 24 ticks per quarter note."
"""Analog clock"" signals are equivalent to the clock signal at pin 3 of DIN sync interface. The clock rate is usually higher than the DIN sync's rate. Typical values are 48, 96 or 192 pulses per quarter note (examples: Oberheim DMX, DX, DSX; Linndrum 1 and 2)."
"""Analog trigger"" signals transfer a pulse per musical event. For instance a trigger corresponds to a step of an analog sequencer or an arpeggiator, a step in a rhythm pattern. Typical analog triggers run at four pulses per quarter note."
"The combination of DIN sync with a different clock system can be achieved either by converting the format and / or the clock rate (see list below) or by using a central unit (so called master clock), which provides multiple clock formats. The approach with a masterclock is usually chosen, especially if a synchronization with absolute time is required, such as synchronisation with a tape recorder or with video footage."
"Typical devices which can act as a master clock and provide DIN sync include the Roland SBX-80, Roland SBX-10, Friendchip SRC, E-RM midiclock⁺ and Yamaha MSS1. Many drum machines which have DIN sync and MIDI clock outputs can act as master clock for those two formats."
"Though DIN sync and MIDI clock have the same clock rate, they require a conversion of the format within a microprocessor or similar. The conversion from MIDI clock to DIN sync is available in many industrial devices. For the conversion from DIN sync to MIDI clock there is at the moment only the device 'Sync-Split2' of the company Innerclock Systems. Also two no longer produced devices do this type of conversion: Roland SBX10, Korg KMS30. On September 1st 2014, Roland introduced the SBX-1 which provides MIDI to sync24 or sync48 conversion."
"To get an analog trigger or clock from the DIN syncs clock signal one has to use digital frequency division or frequency multiplication. There are no dedicated industrial devices which provide a division. The Roland SBX10 can convert into a 48, 96, and 120 PPQN clock."
"Some devices have a DIN sync input as well as DIN sync output, other device have only a single DIN socket which sometimes can be switched between input and output."
"Note that sync48 devices can be combined with sync24 devices, if 32nd notes are programmed instead of 16th notes."

"Dr. S. Revathi (pen name: Kutti Revathi) is an Indian lyricist, poet, activist and a doctor. She has published three books of poetry and is the editor of ""Panikkudam"", a literary quarterly for women's writing and also the first Tamil feminist magazine. Post several literary meetings and reviewing poetry collections by fellow students, she began working on some of her own pieces. Following school, she studied Siddha medicine and got a bachelor's degree in Siddha medicine and surgery, one of the oldest medical systems in the world that derived from her native Tamil Nadu. She had been pursuing her doctoral research in medical anthropology at the Madras Institute of Development Studies in Chennai. Revathi received the Sigaram 15: Faces of Future award for literature from India Today and was awarded a travel grant in 2005 by the Sahitya Akademi to meet leading litterateurs from India. She is a contemporary Tamil poet and has published numerous controversial poetry collections."
"Works by her are noted to be much women-centric. ""Panikkudam"" the first Tamil feminist magazine by her claimed varied aspects such as family, politics, business, discovery of feminine language, introducing modern play, novels, short stories and poetry created by women writers. Interviews of women writers, introduction to modern poetry and short stories, translations of such works into Tamil from World languages, discussions of the creative process and sangam literature were some of the elements that made the part of the magazine. In the field of poetry, her first release in the year 2000 was ""Poonaiyai Pola Alaiyum Velicham"". Kutti Revathi's second book, ""Mulaigal"" that was published in 2002, evoked a storm of protest and stirred controversies from the conservatives of the Tamil literary establishment. The consequences of release were such that a group of outraged male film lyricists damned the book. The debate extended to parameters of cultural debate: obscene calls, letters and threats ensued, and comments on the author's morality were freely aired. While one lyricist demanded that writers of her types must watch out for dire consequences, the other exhorted the public to burn them on Chennai's Mount Road. However she explained, ""My aim is to explore 'Mulaigal' (breasts) as an 'inhabited' living reality, rather than an 'exhibited' commodity."" Adjoint to the content, an essay titled ""With Words I Weave My Body"", she discussed the ways in which a patriarchal tradition, fearful of sharing the power of the written word, compelled women to imprint narratives on their bodies. Her third release was ""Thanimaiyin Aayiram Irakkaigal"" in 2003."
"In 2007 the English translation of her poetry ""Body's Door"" was released. ""Shattered Boundaries"" another collection of her poems in English translation was released in 2012."
"Revathi was roped in for the 2013 film ""Maryan"" two-and-a-half years ago when the film's director Bharatbala was on the lookout for a Tamil scholar. For the same film's soundtrack album, she wrote lyrics of the melancholic song ""Yenga Pona Raasa"" and the track ""Nenjae Ezhu"". Upon the musical success of the album especially the track ""Nenjae Ezhu"", her lyrical styles were critically applauded. She wrote the lyrics for the song ""Ennile Maha Oliyo"" that was aired on MTV Coke Studio (India). And She also has written a song for the music scored by Oscar composer AR Rahman in Tamil Version of the film MOM directed by Ravi Udyawar."

Indigenous Mexican-Americans usually speak an Indigenous language as their first language and may not speak either Spanish or English. Indigenous Mexican-Americans may or may not identify as ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino""."
"California is home to a large and growing population of Indigenous people of Mexican birth or descent. 200,000 people in the state are descended from one or more of Mexico's over 60 Indigenous groups. Many of these Indigenous Mexican-Americans hail from the indigenous people of Oaxaca, with California being home to between 100,000 and 150,000 indigenous Oaxacans. 50,000 are estimated to be Mixtec, an indigenous people from the La Mixteca region of Western Oaxaca and nearby portions of Puebla and Guerrero."
"The slur ""Oaxaquita"" (""Little Oaxacan"") is sometimes used as a derogatory term that is used by Spanish-speaking Mexican-Americans against Indigenous Mexican-Americans. The term carries the connotation that being from Oaxaca is negative and is often used against any Mexican-American who is short or fat. The slur ""indito"" (""little Indian"") is also used against Indigenous Oaxacans. Indigenous Mexican-Americans have been subjected to ridicule, derision, stereotyping, teasing, bullying, and other forms of discrimination and abuse by non-Indigenous Mexican-Americans. Dynamics of racism and discrimination that exist within Mexico also exist within Mexican-American immigrant communities."
"Discrimination against indigenous Oaxacan and Mixtec people can also come from Mexican-Americans who, although also coming from an indigenous Mexican background, have stopped speaking a Mixtecan or other Indigenous language. Those who have assimilated by adopting the Spanish or English languages may look down upon Indigenous people who have preserved their language and culture."

"Walter William Strickland, ""de jure"" 9th Baronet (26 May 1851 – 9 August 1938) was an English translator and radical. He became known as the ""Anarchist Baronet"" because he wandered around the world for much of his life espousing radical causes. After receiving Czechoslovakian citizenship in 1923, he renounced his British citizenship and later moved to Java."
"Strickland was born in Westminster while the family estate was at Hildenley Hall near Malton, North Yorkshire. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the eldest son of Sir Charles Strickland, 8th Baronet (1819–1909), the only child of his first marriage to Georgina, daughter of Sir William Milner, 4th Baronet, but never formally used the title he inherited upon his father's death."
"In 1888, he married Eliza Vokes (1860–1946). A polyglot fluent in ancient and modern languages, he wrote several books and pamphlets and translated works of the Czech poet Vítězslav Hálek, as well as Molière and Horace."
"He has been linked with the Voynich manuscript. He may have met Wilfrid Voynich during his first years in London, when Voynich was directly involved in the political activities of Russian refugees in London, under the leadership of Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, who founded the SFRF (Society of Friends of Russian Freedom) and the RFPF (Russian Free Press Fund)."
"In the early 1890s, Strickland went to live abroad. In 1911, he sold the family home, which became a convent. After 1912, he did not live in England. Strickland spent some time in Russia and in 1923 became a citizen of Czechoslovakia, formally renouncing his British citizenship and that he would not be using the title. (There is no mechanism for a baronet to renounce the title, although it is possible to cease using it during his lifetime.)"
"In 1931, he moved to Buitenzorg, Java, where he died in 1938. He and his wife had no children and the title passed to a cousin once removed, Sir Henry Strickland-Constable, 10th Baronet."

The building now accommodates the Karnataka High Court. In the Central Hall a portrait of Sir Mark Cubbon decorates the ceiling. An equestrian statue of Cubbon by Baron Marochetti is located at the back of the building."
"The State Archeological Museum, one of the oldest in India, built in 1876 by Colonel Sankey, located within the Park, is similar in design to the Attara Kacheri in its architectural style and hue. While the original collection in the museum belonged to Benjamin L. Rice of the Mysore Gazetteer, antiquities from Mohenjodaro period are on display in the Museum. Exhibits in the Museum include specimens of Vijaynagara and Halebid architecture, ancient coins and stone inscriptions as old as 5000 years."

The library has presently a collection of 2.65 lakh books and also a Braille section."
"The Preservation Act, 1979 passed by the Government of Karnataka to preserve the uniqueness of the park is under the provision of Karnataka Government Park (Preservation) Act, 1975, which states:"
"""Accordingly, it is directed that neither any land should be granted to nor any further constructions be permitted whether temporary or permanent by any organization or individuals in the Cubbon Park and Lalbagh areas except the constructions taken up by the Horticulture Department in furtherance of the objectives of the department."""

"After being largely ignored since Indian Independence in 1947, a large number of people have slowly started to acknowledge the pioneering work done by Mark Cubbon and other British administrators. On 23 August 2013, the statue of Mark Cubbon was garlanded for the first time since 1947, by Advocate S Umesh of the Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association. The occasion was to mark the 238th birth anniversary of Sir Mark Cubbon. Special permission was obtained from the Karnataka High Court, and Police protection was provided. The group credited Mark for being one of the chief architects of Bengaluru and Mysuru. The move was however opposed by Vatal Nagaraj, infamous for vandalizing the Cenotaph Memorial near the Hudson Memorial Church. However, the association defended their move of honoring Mark Cubbon, as his contribution to Bengaluru was undeniable. Cubbon Park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park way back in 1927, but the name was never popular, and people continued to call it Cubbon Park. Further, according to historians, it would be foolish to erase history, by trying to remove all symbols of British rule, and mere symbolism cannot lead to development."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"Sisenand (Spanish, Galician, and Portuguese: ""Sisenando""; ) ( 605 – 12 March 636) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 631 to 636."
"Sisenand was the governor of Septimania, when the nobles revolted against the Visigothic king, Suintila, over the latter's confiscations of lands and distribution of privileges between the nobility and clergy. Sisenand joined the rebellion and overthrew Suintila with the aid of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, to whom Gothic nobles offered a plate of pure gold in return, weighing 500 pounds. The plate was allegedly a gift that Aetius, a Roman general, gave to Thorismund, then king of the Visigoths, in 451. After successfully overthrowing Suintila and capturing Zaragoza on 26 March 631, Sisenand proclaimed himself king. The victory of Sisenand also represented the triumph of the nobility over the common people, although the greatest beneficiary was the clergy, who took advantage of the weariness of the other contenders to enhance their own influence."
"Upon assuming the throne, he had Suintila, the previous king, declared a tyrant for his many crimes, iniquity, and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the poor; he also removed all taxes on the clergy."
"Between 632 and 633, there was apparently an attempted uprising within the kingdom, led by Iudila, only attested to by two coins from Mérida and Granada bearing the inscription IUDILA REX.. The revolution failed, and Iudila was later killed."
"In order to obtain ecclesiastical conformity, on 8 December 633, Sisenand convoked the IV Council of Toledo, which drew up civil and ecclesiastical laws within the Visigothic kingdom, including the death penalty, excommunication, and condemnation to perpetual perdition for those rebelling against the king. Similar penalties were approved for those who wished to dispense with such law of choice. However, the council did not concede any hereditary right to the king; the next king would be elected by the bishops and magnates from one of their own."

"A jukung or kano, also known as cadik is a small wooden Indonesian outrigger canoe. It is a traditional fishing boat, but newer uses include ""Jukung Dives"", using the boat as a vehicle for small groups of SCUBA divers."
"The double outrigger jukung is but one of many types of Austronesian outrigger canoes that use the crab claw sail traditional throughout Polynesia. Whilst this sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, actually requiring to jibe around, a jukung is superb in its reaching ability and jibe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow."
"People in Kalimantan also named their boat Jukung. It is used for transport in daily activities such as going to the office, to school, or shopping in pasar terapung (The Floating Market, a very famous tourist attraction)."
"Currently there is a modern version of jukung made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in Indonesia. Advertised as unsinkable, the main body is made of a closed HDPE pipe that contains sealed air as the source of its buoyancy."
"In the late 1980s there was a seafaring journey of over 1000 nautical miles in open outrigger ‘jukung’ canoes by nine crews, who sailed from Bali to Darwin across the Timor Sea. Crews were from New Zealand, Australia, USA, England, Japan, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Indonesia. This was a three-month expedition masterminded by Bob Hobmann, filmed and made into a documentary called ""Passage out of Paradise""; it was featured by the National Geographic Society as ""The Great Jukung Race"". It was the first ever expedition of this kind, following purported austronesian sailing routes in craft dating 7,000 years old."
"The expedition started in Bali, where once crews were familiar with sailing their Jukungs they embarked on a two-month adventure following the ancient sailing routes (1,000 yrs BC), along the eastern Islands via Komodo Island. They completed the journey with a treacherous 5 day sail across the Arafura Sea to Darwin, via the Tiwi Islands."
"Challenges experienced were storms requiring numerous boat repairs, waterspouts, excessive exposure to sun, heat, or rain, adverse currents & whirlpools. Hazards included drifting onto war-torn Timor, unpredictable behaviour/welcome from remote villagers, salt water boils, wound infections, malnutrition, near misses with night-time freighters, sightings of sperm whales and giant white sharks. Some sailors were viciously attacked by hornets while preparing to leave a remote beach camp. The crews rebelled & unanimously decided to sail as a group, as opposed to racing the final leg of the journey, for safety."
"As a result, all sailors miraculously survived a cyclone >110 km/hr winds in their tiny (6 ft long, 50 cm wide) primitive bamboo/rope jukungs, although the Australian crew was lost for 2 days, located by the Australian coastguard, with a smashed jukung washed up on an island."
"Genetic data indicate the ""molestus"" form in the London Underground appear to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest above-ground population. Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London once only – many hurdles must be overcome to become adapted to the subterranean environment, and understandably it would occur rarely. This hypothesis implies that local adaptation would be expected in different locations around Europe and beyond, as each local population evolved an offshoot that overcame the problems of living underground."
"However, more recently collected genetic evidence reported by Fonseca and others suggests a single ""C. molestus"" form has spread throughout Europe and beyond, since populations over a large area share a common genetic heritage. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest the underground form developed recently; a single mtDNA difference is shared among the underground populations of 10 Russian cities, and a single fixed microsatellite difference occurs in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, and the Atlantic islands. This worldwide spread might have occurred after the last glaciations or may be even more recent, due to the insects hitchhiking on world trade routes; one possibility is the international secondhand tire trade. The tires retain water in which the larvae can survive, and completely removing water from an old tire can be difficult."
"Now, the persistence of hybrids in northern climates apparently may be another evolutionary problem that can be solved, but only rarely: the Fonseca paper obtained genetic evidence that the recent colonization of America by ""Culex"" mosquitoes actually involves a strain derived from a rare successful hybridization between ""C. pipiens"" and ""C. molestus"". They suggest hybridization may explain why the American form bites both birds and humans (this interpretation is controversial, see letter from Spielman ""et al."" and the response that follows it in ""Science""). The consequences of this more indiscriminate feeding hit the news in 1999 with the outbreak of human encephalitis in New York, caused by West Nile virus. It was the first documented introduction of this virus into the Western Hemisphere; perhaps because in the longer established populations, the Old World northern above-ground ""C. pipiens"" almost exclusively bites birds, with the human-biting ones being incarcerated below ground."
"""Culex molestus"" has been observed in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Its country of origin is thought to be Egypt, although it has likely spread via trade and colonial passages over the past centuries."
"In the summer of 2011, an invasion of ""Culex molestus"" appeared on the Upper West Side in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The mosquito is well known for being commonly found in sewers of New York and thriving throughout the year feeding on humans. Residents of older brownstones found the mosquitoes coming from the underground into basements and then through air vents and other openings into their homes. The city government did not make this infestation of the pest a top priority because they tested negative for West Nile virus and because of the high cost of mosquito control."
"In Australia, ""Culex molestus"" was first recorded in the 1940s, and has since spread across all southern states, causing a significant biting nuisance in urban areas. Unlike most Australian urban mosquitos, ""molestus"" is active through all 12 months of the year. Its introduction was likely through military movements into Melbourne during World War II, and genetic studies have indicated its most likely passage was from eastern Asia and Japan. It has also been identified as a potential vector for several Australian blood-borne diseases, such as Ross River virus."

"The IBM Z family maintains full backward compatibility. In effect, current systems are the direct, lineal descendants of System/360, announced in 1964, and the System/370 from the 1970s. Many applications written for these systems can still run unmodified on the newest IBM Z system over five decades later."
"Virtualization is required by default on IBM Z systems. First layer virtualization is provided by the Processor Resource and System Manager (PR/SM) to deploy one or more Logical Partitions (LPARs). Each LPAR supports a variety of operating systems. A hypervisor called z/VM can also be run as the second layer virtualization in LPARs to create as many virtual machines (VMs) as there are resources assigned to the LPARs to support them. The first layer of IBM Z virtualization (PR/SM) allows a z machine to run a limited number of LPARs (up to 80 on the IBM z13). These can be considered virtual ""bare metal"" servers because PR/SM allows CPUs to be dedicated to individual LPARs. z/VM LPARs allocated within PR/SM LPARs can run a very large number of virtual machines as long as there are adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources configured with the system for the desired performance, capacity, and throughput."
"IBM Z's PR/SM and hardware attributes allow compute resources to be dynamically changed to meet workload demands. CPU and memory resources can be non-disruptively added to the system and dynamically assigned, recognized, and used by LPARs. I/O resources such as IP and SAN ports can also be added dynamically. They are virtualized and shared across all LPARs. The hardware component that provides this capability is called the Channel Subsystem. Each LPAR can be configured to either ""see"" or ""not see"" the virtualized I/O ports to establish desired ""shareness"" or isolation. This virtualization capability allows significant reduction in I/O resources because of its ability to share them and drive up utilization."
"PR/SM on IBM Z has earned Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 5+ security certification, and z/VM has earned Common Criteria EAL4+ certification."
The KVM hypervisor from Linux has also been ported.
"Since the move away from the System/390 name, a number of IBM Z models have been released. These can be grouped into families with similar architectural characteristics."
"The IBM zEnterprise System (zEnterprise), announced in July 2010, with the z196 model, is designed to offer both mainframe and distributed server technologies in an integrated system. The zEnterprise System consists of three components. First is a System z server. Second is the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX). Last is the management layer, IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager), which provides a single management view of zEnterprise resources. The zEnterprise is designed to extend mainframe capabilities – management efficiency, dynamic resource allocation, serviceability – to other systems and workloads running on AIX on POWER7, and Microsoft Windows or Linux on x86."
"The zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) is an infrastructure component that hosts both general purpose blade servers and appliance-like workload optimizers which can all be managed as if they were a single mainframe. The zBX supports a private high speed internal network that connects it to the central processing complex, which reduces the need for networking hardware and provides inherently high security."
"The IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager integrates the System z and zBX resources as a single virtualized system and provides unified and integrated management across the zEnterprise System. It can identify system bottlenecks or failures among disparate systems and if a failure occurs it can dynamically reallocate system resources to prevent or reduce application problems. The Unified Resource Manager provides energy monitoring and management, resource management, increased security, virtual networking, and information management from a single user interface."
Highlights of the original zEnterprise z196 include:
"The newest zEnterprise, the EC12, was announced in August 2012, and included:"
"On April 8, 2014, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the System/360 mainframe, IBM announced the release of its first converged infrastructure solution based on mainframe technology.

"Bob Wren Stadium is a baseball stadium located in Athens, Ohio on the campus of Ohio University. It serves as the home field for the Ohio Bobcats since opening on April 18, 1998. The Bobcats opened the facility by defeating the Bowling Green Falcons 4–1 in front of 1,389 fans."
"Bob Wren Stadium features many modern amenities and has a capacity of 4,000. The stadium has 100 chairback seats that are part of the VIP club, named the Baumholtz club in honor of former Ohio baseball player Frank Baumholtz. In addition, there are around 1,000 bleacher-back seats in the stadium and another 1,000 seats of regular bleachers. Down both the third and first base lines there are two grassy knolls that are capable of seating up to another 1,000 fans."
"There are two concession stands available with traditional ballpark fare, and members of the Baumholtz Club have access to a private lounge that serves more upscale food items. The press box provides multiple phones and computer lines for members of the media. There are also two radio broadcast booths and one television broadcast booth available."
"The stadium has already undergone several modifications since opening. In 2003, a large Daktronics digital scoreboard was added to the outfield of the stadium. That same year, heated batting cages were added to the northeast of the stadium, allowing Bobcat players to practice inside during cold weather. Most recently, lights were installed in 2004. As a result of this new addition, 15 of Ohio's 28 home games in 2005 were played at night."
"The stadium is named for former Bobcat head coach Bob Wren, who held the highest all-time winning percentage of any Ohio baseball coach."
"In addition to serving as the home of Ohio Bobcats baseball, Bob Wren Stadium is home to the Southern Ohio Copperheads of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League and is the home of the state American Legion baseball tournament every year."

= = = Modibo Adama = = =
"Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (1786 – 1847), more commonly known as Modibbo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fombina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region."
"Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title ""Modibbo"" (""Lettered One"") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as ""Lamido Fombina"" (Ruler of the Southlands)."
"Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town."
"Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government."
"Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon."
"Adama came from a respected but humble family; his father, Hassana, was a well regarded scholar of Islam and minor nobleman from Ba'ajo. Adama travelled to Bornu for his education, where he stayed for some time under the tutelage of Mallam Kiari. He continued his studies in Hausaland (modern Northern Nigeria), where legend says his teacher was the Fulani Shehu Usman dan Fodio in Degel. Adama proved a bright scholar and a pious Muslim, and he earned the title ""Modibo"", ""Lettered One"". After several years away, he returned home to Guringa around 1804. There, the news was grim. Adama's father had died in 1803 fighting the Bata."
Talk in Gurina also concerned events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and Kébbi. Usman had now turned his attention to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).
"Still, the picture seemed unclear to leaders farther from the fighting. Was Usman a ""Mujaddid"" (reformer), or was he the ""Mahdi"", a saviour figure who would create an ideal Muslim society? In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa assembled a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission."
"The party met Usman in 1806, probably in Gwandu. There, they learned that his intention was to extend his jihad eastward, into Fumbina. The goal was ostensibly to convert various Kirdi (pagan) peoples to Islam and to protect Muslims who already lived in the area. The jihadists were also supposed to educate the region's current Muslim population, many of whom merged Islam with paganism."
"Though not the oldest member, Adama was one of the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus presented him with a command that would change his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches."
"Adama immediately began recruiting Fulani and Hausa volunteers and mercenaries. These were mainly mounted cavalrymen fighting with sword, bow, and poisoned arrow. Adama forbade them to pillage or to kill indiscriminately, but enemy nations were given two choices: convert to Islam or become a tributary state. Those ethnic groups that lacked a centralised government had but one: become slaves to the Fulani and convert to their faith."
"The non-Fulani Muslims of the Adamawa largely rejected Adama's jihad; they viewed it as little more than an excuse to spread Fulani hegemony. However, it was primarily the Fulani leaders (""ardo'en"", singular: ""ardo"") of Fumbina with whom Adama was concerned. Some of them rejected his primacy for various reasons: He was from a fairly humble background, he owned little wealth, his army was still small, and he lacked charisma. The majority, however, welcomed Adama as a military commander or religious leader at the very least. Adama's son-in-law, Jauro Dembo, had already settled in Fumbina at Malabu and became one of his lieutenants."
"The makeshift army made headquarters at Gurin, a fort at the junction of the Faro and Benue Rivers where Fulani warriors had regrouped after fighting the Bata in 1803. Adama then led his forces in a series of strikes on Bata settlements such as Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. The victories elated Adama's men, who took numerous Bata slaves."
"The early successes convinced more local Fulani leaders to come to Adama's side. Even those ardo'en who opposed his political rule recognised the jihad as an opportunity to expand their territories. Njobdi of the Wollarbe clan is one notable example, and his major rival, Hammam Sambo, perhaps the first ardo to have settled in Fumbina, proved the major holdout. Bitter relations between Njobdi and Hammam would prove a major obstacle in Adama's quest to maintain a cohesive empire."
"Ourense Cathedral (Catedral de Ourense or Catedral do San Martiño) is a Roman Catholic church located in Ourense in northwestern Spain. Dedicated to St Martin, it was founded in 550. The first structure was restored by Alonso el Casto. The present mainly Gothic building was raised with the support of Bishop Lorenzo in 1220. Its local patroness is Saint Euphemia. There is a silver-plated shrine, and others of St Facundus and St Primitivus. The Christ's Chapel (Capilla del Cristo Crucificado) was added in 1567 by Bishop San Francisco Triccio. It contains an image of Christ, which was brought in 1330 from a small church on Cape Finisterre. John the Baptist's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan Bautista) was created in 1468 by the Conde de Benavente. The Portal of Paradise is sculptured and enriched with figures of angels and saints, while the antique cloisters were erected in 1204 by Bishop Ederonio. The Capilla de la Maria Madre was restored in 1722, and connected by the cloisters with the cathedral. The eight canons were called Cardenales, as at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and they alone did services before the altar; this custom was recognised as ""immemorial"" by Pope Innocent III, in 1209. The cathedral, which has undergone an impressive transition of architectural styles of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical, was built to a Latin Cross plan. It has been a functional basilica since 1887. The cathedral has a crucifix that is held in great reverence all over Galicia."
"The earliest cathedral in Ourense appears to have been the church dedicated to Santa María la Madre. In 550, the Suevian king Chararic built a second church dedicated to St Martin of Tours on the site of today's cathedral of the Auriense diocese. It was also the time when the arch bridge opposite the cathedral was built over the river, facilitating access to the thermal springs. The cathedral was however repeatedly destroyed over the centuries by the Moors and the Northmen who invaded the city. Today's building was constructed as a Romanesque church in the 12th and 13th centuries. Construction was supported by Bishop Lorenzo, who also built the new Ourense bridge and the bishop's palace."
Gothic additions followed until the early 16th century. There is little historical documentation on the construction of the building but there is a clear record mentioning the consecration of the high altar in 1188.
"The cathedral was classified as a national monument in June 1931. Since 1887, it has officially been designated a basilica."
"The cathedral plan takes the form of a Latin cross, the nave being flanked by slightly lower lateral aisles. It measures in length and across the transversal transept. Completed in 1505 by Rodrigo de Badajoz, the octagonal Gothic lantern tower with its three levels of windows rises above the point where the transept crosses the nave. The former apse was later converted into an ambulatory bordered by a series of chapels including the 15th-century St John's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan) and the 16th-century Chapel of Snows (Capilla de las Nieves). After the chancel had been demolished in the 20th century, the choir stalls were moved into the body of the church and into Christ's Chapel."
"The North Door (Portada Norte), initially of Romanesque design, has a variety of Gothic additions. The tympanum is crowned by a cross where Mary takes possession of Christ's body. Other decorations include an allusion to the miracle of St Martin who is depicted tearing his cloak in two as well as the figure of James the apostle (known as Santiago in Spanish). The turrets on either side of the entrance are no doubt the result of the need to protect the doorway which had been destroyed by Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel in 1471."
"To the right of the South Door (Portada Sur) which is topped by fine decorations, there is a 16th-century clock tower. The south façade was initially symmetrical with two defensive towers but the clock tower now looks less imposing. The east gable is flanked by the unfinished 16th-century Tower of St Martin and the 40-metre-tall bell tower which was repaired at the end of the 19th century as it had been damaged by the earthquake which hit Lisbon in 1755. The 16th-century rose window can still be seen."
"The Gothic influence can be clearly seen in the nave with its decorative arches and vaulted ceiling. Repairs and additions have also led to decorations in the Renaissance and Baroque styles in the chapels. The cathedral's main altarpiece in the flamboyant Gothic style is believed to be the work of Cornielles de Holanda with five vertical panels each divided into horizontal compartments. Martin of Tours is depicted in the central panel as the cathedral's patron saint while scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary can be seen in the other panels. On either side of the main altar, there are two other altars representing the martyred saints of Ourense: Facundus, Primitivus and Euphemia."
"Christ's Chapel (La capilla del Santo Cristo), to the right of the North Door, originally presented the figure of Christ rather than today's altar bearing Our Lady of the Pillar. The chapel owes its origin to Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño who wished to be buried as close as possible to the figure of Christ. The chapel is decorated in flamboyant Baroque style with a Renaissance screen by Juan Bautista Celma and a canopy by Domingo de Andrade while other decorations are the work of Francisco de Castro Canseco. The Renaissance choir stalls which once stood in the cathedral's chancel were crafted by Diego de Solís and Juan de Angers. The chapel also contains many other offerings including 18th-century paintings with scenes of Christ's life and the evening meal at Emmaus."
"The 13th-century Portico of Paradise (Pórtico del Paraíso) was built by students of Master Mateo who is best known for his Pórtico de la Gloria in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Its three arches are supported by slender columns with a central mullion. The apostle St James or Santiago holds a sword reminiscent of his alleged miraculous participation in the legendary Battle of Clavijo. The original 13th-century figure was replaced in the 19th century. The statue of the Virgin of Consolation (Virgen del Consuelo) with the body of Christ which tops the mullion was also added in the 19th century. Other decorations include Christ being tempted by the devil, a medallion of God the Father and a tabernacle presenting St Martin tearing his cloak. The archivolts of the central arch bear the figures of the 24 elders from the Book of Revelation. The columns themselves are sculpted with apostles and prophets while the capitals present a variety of figures including Christ's temptations in the desert, centaurs fighting mermaids, dragons and harpies with frightening faces who were said to have brought the plague. The vividly coloured pilaster figures were restored in the 18th century from the original Romanesque polychrome. The two Baroque side chapels contain a Castro Canseco altarpiece of the Nursing Madonna and a representation of San Francisco Blanco from Ourense who was crucified in Japan in 1597."
"The cathedral was the burial place for several individuals from the 13th to the 15th centuries in chapels of evolving Gothic design. The tomb of Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño (died 1342) is in the northern transept; Bishop Lorenzo (died mid-12th century) is entombed in the nave of the epistle; Don Alonso González del Padrón is entombed next to the St Luke's chapel; the tomb of the Infantina, who may have been a Castilian princess, is next to the Capilla de las Nieves; two bishops, including Bishop Quevedo, are also entombed on the wall of the epistle."
"The cathedral museum is accessed through the Romanesque door leading to the Gothic cloisters known as Claustra Nova. Artifacts include ""El Incunable de Monterrey"", the first book published in Galicia in 1494, Enrique de Arfe's processional cross, 13th-century enamels from Limoges, the so-called Treasure of San Rosendo and the oldest Christian tombstone in Galicia from Baños de Bande."

"John Trout Greble (January 19, 1834 in Philadelphia – June 10, 1861 in Virginia) was a soldier in the United States Army. He was killed at the battle of Big Bethel, and was the first graduate of the United States Military Academy to be killed in the American Civil War."
"He graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1854, was assigned to the 2nd artillery, and stationed at Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1854 he was made 2nd lieutenant and sent to Tampa, Florida, where he served in the Indian troubles for two years. He was compelled, in consequence of a severe fever, to return home on sick leave, but in the beginning of 1856 resumed his duties, acting part of the time as quartermaster and commissary until December 1856, when he was appointed acting assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics in the U.S. Military Academy, where he remained until September 24, 1860. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on March 3, 1857."
"He was detailed for active duty at Fort Monroe in late 1860, and rendered efficient service in preventing its seizure. On May 26, 1861, he was sent to Newport News as master of ordnance, superintended the fortifications of that point, and trained the volunteers to artillery practice. When the expedition to Big Bethel was planned, he was unexpectedly detailed to accompany it with two guns, though in his own judgment it was ill-advised. When the Union Army troops were repelled, by his management of the guns he protected them from pursuit and destruction. Just at the close of the action, when he had given the orders to withdraw his guns from the field, he was struck by a rifle ball on the right temple and instantly killed. For his bravery in the two days' action, he was brevetted captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, on the day of his death. First Buried in Philadelphia's Woodland Cemetery he was later reburied in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Montgomery County Pennsylvania"

"Furthermore, it may be viewed as a facetted dodecahedron: the pentagonal faces may be inscribed within the dodecahedron's pentagons. Its dual, the medial triambic icosahedron, is a stellation of the icosahedron."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-6 pentagonal tiling, by distorting the pentagrams back into regular pentagons. As such, it is a regular polyhedron of index two:"

"Aside from the regular small stellated dodecahedron {/,5} and great stellated dodecahedron {/,3}, it is the only nonconvex uniform polyhedron whose faces are all non-convex regular polygons (star polygons), namely the star polygons {/} and {/}."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 6 decagrammic faces passing through the model center.
Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosidodecahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common) and the great icosihemidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common).
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, the middle of the pentagrams are over empty space, as can be seen from the picture of the great dodecahemicosahedron above. Hence, some, such as Jonathan Bowers, do not fill in the middle of the pentagram: this filling has been called ""natural filling"". In the natural filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the ""Nation of Gods and Earths"" (NGE/NOGE) or the ""Five Percenters"", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as ""Allah the Father""). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified."
"Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest."

"After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time."
"W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire ""temple"" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the ""salat"", to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca."
"A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader."
"Although at first the India-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's efforts were broadly concentrated at over large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times."
"""Salafi methodology means that Muslims teach and understand the holy texts, the Qur’an and the prophetic Sunnah by learning Arabic and trying to live as closely to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) as possible. The early Salafis (the first three generations) are referred to as the righteous companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam). Of course, there are some state and federal laws where they must make exceptions, such as getting photos taken for identification purposes and basically obeying secular law. Most Salafis do not wish to participate in modern photography. It is considered haram, which means unlawful in Arabic."""
"Philadelphia has one of the largest concentrations of Muslims in the United States. Philadelphia's Germantown Salafi community is one of the most important, as their community is primarily African American and adherents to the Salafi methodology, according to the first three generations of Muslims. There has been an increase of authentic teachings of Islam in the United States over the past several decades to mitigate many misunderstandings, incorrect deviant sects and harmful, terrorist propagated teachings that are against traditional Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) and his righteous companions. The Germantown community has been one of the largest representatives of this effort. Teachings of correct Aqeedah (creed) and Minhaaj (methodology) according to the authentic prophetic traditions are their foundation."
"The Germantown community has a very Muslim feel with Muslim stores of various sorts. Anything from halal meat shops, clothing, authentic book stores and various Muslim businesses line the commercial corridor. One of the defining representations of the community is seeing Salafi Muslim women dressed in full length black Abayas and Hijabs, Salafi Muslim men wearing the Kufi (style of Muslim hat) mandatory beards and white Thobes (usually white lining robes) with pants underneath and above the ankles as a signature style for the community."
"Conversion to Islam is a practice which is common to African-Americans in prison. J. Michael Waller found that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. According to him, 80% of the prisoners who ""find faith"" while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests."

"When Seiya, Hyōga and Shun visit Saori (Athena) at the orphanage, they meet an employee called Eri. An orphan herself, Eri takes a liking to Hyōga and one night they sit outside watching the stars. They see a shooting star and Hyōga asks Eri to make a wish. After Hyōga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a golden apple. She is then possessed by Eris, the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world. Eris leaves a message for the Bronze Saints, who set out for the goddess's temple which appears on the mountains. There, the heroes fight the five Ghost Saints: Sagitta Maya, Lyra Orpheus, Southern Cross Khristós, Scutum Jan and Orion Jäger."
"is the second anime film by Toei Animation based on the ""Saint Seiya"" manga. It premiered on March 12, 1988 in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival along with the movie versions of ""Lady Lady!!"", ""Bikkuriman"" and ""Kamen Rider Black"". The soundtrack was composed by Seiji Yokoyama and released in the Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack IV – The Heated Battle of the Gods CD."
"In Siberia, Hyōga saves a man that is being attacked. Injured, the man manages only to say something about Asgard. Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiryū and Shun are wondering about Hyōga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At Valhalla, the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hyōga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiryū, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of Odin. Midgard reveals himself as Hyōga and tries to kill Shiryū to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hyōga."
"Due to this film's popularity, Toei Animation created the Asgard saga for the anime, which did not originally appear in the manga and is set between the Sanctuary and Poseidon arcs of the story."
"is the third anime film by Toei Animation based on the ""Saint Seiya"" manga. Unlike its predecessors, which premiered on the Toei Manga Matsuri film festivals, this installment was instead shown at the ""Weekly Jump"" 20th Anniversary Festival along with the animated movie version of ""Sakigake!! Otokojuku""."
"Athena receives the visit of Phoebus Abel, her older brother and God of the Corona. He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of Carina, Jaow of Lynx and Berenike of Coma Berenices, and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of Gemini, Deathmask of Cancer, Shura of Capricorn, Camus of Aquarius and Aphrodite of Pisces. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to Elysion, the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel."
"Unlike the other ""Saint Seiya"" movies made in the 1980s, this one was a full featured film, having a running time of 75 minutes. The events occur sometime after the Poseidon saga and before the Fallen Angels saga (4th movie)."
"The plot involves the coming of Lucifer to the Sanctuary, where his underlings systematically dispose of the surviving Gold Saints. Athena goes to Lucifer to ask for peace, placing herself in peril. The Bronze Saints must then come to her rescue, destroying Lucifer's Fallen Angels (""Seima Tenshi"" in Japanese) in the process."
The soundtrack was composed by Seiji Yokoyama and released in the Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack VIII – Warriors of the Final Holy Battle CD.
"After the success of the OVA series ""Hades - Chapter Sanctuary"", this movie served as a continuation to the Hades saga. Injured after his confrontation with Hades, Seiya is in a coma and under Saori's care. The Goddess Artemis, Saori's older sister, comes to Earth to ask why she is not fulfilling her duties as a Goddess and takes control of Sanctuary in her stead. Hoping that it may bring peace on Earth, Saori goes to the Sanctuary and starts spilling her blood and it is up to the Bronze Saints to save her."
"After the bloody battle against Hades, goddess Athena's Saints are still recovering when they find themselves face to face with their newest and most formidable foe: the dreadful goddess Artemis, accompanied by her Angels. Artemis replaces Athena as the Earth guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants."
"Upon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control."
"The movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, Eagle Marin also appears, as Ophiuchus Shaina, Unicorn Jabu, and Hydra Ichi do, though the latter three are just cameos."
"The movie also has a very ambiguous ending, with many plot points and danglers unresolved."
A Live Action film was announced at Comic Con Brazil 2016.
= = = BBC Regional Programme = = =
"The BBC Regional Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced a number of earlier BBC local stations – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand, Westminster, London, which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of the six commercial companies which created the BBC), the technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or for joint programming between transmitters. Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities."
"By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible, at least between main transmitters and relay stations, but the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts."
"In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest."
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 1 kW.
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 120 W
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high-power mediumwave transmitter, 5GB, at its Daventry site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service – which eventually came to be called the BBC National Programme – programmed from London and available to the majority of the population."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme""."
The local transmitters were gradually either converted to a regional service relay or closed entirely and replaced by high power regional broadcasts. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX; initially these were on three separate frequencies and programming included some local variations. As the regional network expanded these transmissions were fully synchronized with those from Brookmans Park.
A relay station for Brookmans Park on 1402 kHz was due to open at Acle near Norwich in 1940. Construction was postponed by the outbreak of war. The station was never completed and was replaced by one at Postwick.
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The transmitter network was synchronized on 668 and 767 kHz in order to use the other frequencies for propaganda broadcasts in foreign languages. Each transmitter group would be turned off during an air raid to prevent their signals being used as navigational beacons and listeners were required to retune to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but kept the name ""BBC Home Service"". The National Programme was also reopened under a new name as the BBC Light Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light and dance music than its successor, the Home Service."

"He is best known for his work ""US Money Vs Corporation Currency, ""Aldrich Plan,"" Wall Street Confessions! Great Bank Combine"" (1912), which argues against the formation of The Federal Reserve. He feared national banking, but he feared private control of the United States money system even more."
= = = Robert Babikan = = =
"Robert Babikan was a British racing driver. He was most notable for competing in the British GT Championship in 2000 and 2001, and racing in a single round of the European Le Mans Series in 2001. He won the Porsche Cup GB in 1996."
"In 1996, Babikan entered the Porsche Cup GB, and took both the Class 2 title, and the overall title, whilst driving a Porsche 911 Carrera. He moved into the Class 1 of the Porsche Cup GB in 1997, driving a Porsche 911 Carrera 2; he finished fifth in class, with 196 points. In 1998, Babikan remained in the Porsche Cup GB, driving a Porsche 911 Carrera 2. He finished in second in round five, held at Oulton Park, round nine, held at Castle Combe. and in round 12, held at Donington Park."
"Babikan made his first appearance in a major series in 2000, driving a PK Motorsport-entered Porsche 911 GT2 in the British GT Championship. He made his debut in the series in the opening round at Thruxton, partnering Terry Rymer, but retired from the race without completing a lap. The following round, held at Croft, saw the pair last ten laps before retiring once more. He was partnered by Brian Robinson at Oulton Park, and finished for the first time, taking sixth place overall, and fourth in the GT category. At Donington Park, he partnered Fred Moss, and finished fifth. Having missed the next race, held at Silverstone, he and Moss took eighth at Brands Hatch, and another fifth at Donington Park. The team retired after 17 laps in the second Silverstone race of the season, missed the Snetterton round, and retired once more from the Spa-Francorchamps round, having completed six laps. Although initially listed as entering the season finale, held at Silverstone, he did not compete, and was replaced by Michael Pickup. He finished 22nd in the GT category Driver's Championship, with 24 points; three behind David Leslie in 21st, and seven ahead of Charlie Cox in 23rd."
"For 2001, Babikan returned to the Porsche Cup GB. At the opening race of the season, held at Silverstone, he finished sixth in the sprint race, driving a Class 1 Porsche 911 GT3 Supercup, and fifth in the feature race. In the second round, held at Snetterton, he took sixth in both races, which was followed by a fifth and a third in the next round, held at Donington Park. He followed this with a third-place position in the next race at Oulton Park. At Croft, he was replaced by Paul Mace, and he did not enter the sixth round of the season, held at Rockingham. He returned for round 7, held at Brands Hatch, now driving a Class 2 Porsche 911 Carrera (993); he finished tenth overall, and third in class in the sprint race, before finishing twelfth overall, and third in class, in the feature race. Round eight, held at Donington Park, yielded two tenth places in the overall standings, with a fifth and third in class, before he made his first appearance in the European Le Mans Series in 2001 at Most, driving for PK Motorsport in a Porsche 996 GT3-R alongside Piers Masarati and Milan Maderyč; the team were disqualified, having finished eighth, for dangerous driving. Although the team entered Babikan in the following round at Vallelunga, he did not actually drive. Following this, he competed in the Brands Hatch round of the British GT Championship, driving a Porsche 911 GT3-R for Harlow Motorsport alongside Neil Cunningham; the pair finished eighth overall, and fourth in the GTO category. Babikan was classified joint-33rd in the GTO category of the British GT Championship, with eight points; level with Cunningham and Ben McLoughlin."
= = = Alison Saunders = = =
"Dame Alison Margaret Saunders, (born 14 February 1961) is a British barrister and a former Director of Public Prosecutions. She was the first lawyer from within the Crown Prosecution Service and the second woman to hold the appointment. She was also the first holder of this office not to be a Queen's Counsel. She was previously the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London. Her term of office ended 31 October 2018."
"Saunders was born on 14 February 1961 in Aberdeen, Scotland to Hugh Colin Brown and Margaret Bennett Brown. She attended primary school in Brixton, London and St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff. Saunders then studied at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire. She read law at the University of Leeds from 1979 to 1982. She graduated Bachelor of Laws (LLB hons)."
"Having completed her pupillage and thereby becoming a qualified barrister, Saunders began working for Lloyd's of London. She joined the newly formed CPS in 1986. In 1991, she joined the CPS policy division. She was appointed Branch Crown Prosecutor for Wood Green in 1997, and Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London South in 1999. She took up the appointment of Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex in 2001 overseeing the case made against Roy Whiting, who was convicted of murdering Sarah Payne. Between 2003 and 2005, she served as Deputy Legal Advisor to the Attorney General. She then became head of prosecutions for the Organised Crime division of the CPS. She was the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London from 2009 until 2013. During that time, she was involved in the 2011 to 2012 retrial, and subsequent conviction, of the killers of Stephen Lawrence."
"On 23 July 2013, it was announced that she would become the new Director of Public Prosecutions in succession to Sir Keir Starmer, taking up the appointment on 1 November 2013. She was the first head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be appointed from within the service and the second woman to hold the appointment."
"As the Director of Public Prosecutions, Saunders has faced criticism and controversy around the handling of trials for rape and sexual assault. The CPS has been criticised for the case of Eleanor de Freitas, who killed herself after the CPS decided to take over a private prosecution brought against her by the man she accused of rape. Saunders said that the ""evidence in this case was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice"". Saunders has also stated that the number of rape prosecutions being brought to court will increase by a third in the year 2015 and has argued that this increase follows improvements in the treatment received by victims by police, courts and the CPS."
"In 2014, Saunders announced the CPS would be seeking to fight against criminals hiding assets abroad and appointed a team of six specialist lawyers to work with legal authorities overseas to recover assets from countries including Spain and the United Arab Emirates."
"In April 2015, Saunders was criticized for her decision not to prosecute Greville Janner on child sexual abuse charges despite his meeting the evidential test for prosecution, citing his poor health, as well as for dropping charges against nine journalists as part of the Operation Elveden case. Saunders defended herself saying, ""I’m not here to make popular decisions. I always feel under pressure to make the right decision."" In June 2015, ""The Guardian"" reported that, following a review, the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner would in fact be overturned. Simon Danczuk, then MP for Rochdale, told the Guardian that ""if the report is accurate, Saunders will now have to consider her position"" as a result of the scrutiny that her initial decision would now be placed under. The decision marks the first time a DPP has had a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. Amid calls for her resignation, she told the BBC that she would not resign. Saunders blamed failings within her department and the police for the collapse of three different police inquiries between 1991 and 2007. Theresa May (then the home secretary, later Prime Minister) said in a radio interview: “I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. It is not my decision, it is entirely a decision for the director of public prosecutions.”"
"In 2015, a case was brought against Saunders in the High Court. The Plaintiff, Nikki Kenward, argued that Saunders had amended prosecution policy outside of the democratic process. Saunders released the alleged amendment in October, 2014. In it she suggested that the guidelines on assisted suicide prosecution be understood such that a doctor who is not the patient's immediate care provider, should not be as likely to face prosecution as a doctor who is the patient's immediate care provider. This prompted a backlash from anti-assisted suicide groups who argued that this was a substantial change, which would allow for businesses similar to Dignitas to operate in the UK. Saunders' defence was that she had only clarified the existing guidelines. Nevertheless, Kenward was granted the judicial review against Saunders in April, 2015. It went to the High Court in November, 2015 where the case against Saunders was dismissed."
"As of 2018, Saunders was paid a salary of between £210,000 and £214,999."
"On 2 April 2018, it was announced that Saunders was to stand down at the end of her term as head of the CPS and on 1 November 2018 she was succeeded as Director of Public Prosecutions by Max Hill QC."
"In June 2015, Saunders was accused by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer of a crusade to criminalise ""drunken sexual encounters"". In December 2017, ""The Daily Telegraph"" journalist Allison Pearson called for Saunders to resign following the scandal of several high-profile rape cases falling apart or convictions being overturned due to police withholding key information regarding the innocence of the accused."
"On 23 January 2018, however, Saunders was criticised by victims and survivors' groups because her words could be taken to mean that silence equates to consent."
"After it was announced that Saunders would not be reappointed for a second term, ""The Daily Telegraph"" also reported in April, 2018 that crime statistics tracking burglary, violent crime and shoplifting all rose significantly under Saunders' tenure ever since she first became Director of Public Prosecutions."
"On 29 December 2018 ""The Telegraph"" reported that Alison Saunders will be ""the first former head of the Crown Prosecution Service not to receive a senior honour after her tenure was marked by a series of scandals"". (All of her predecessors ""became a knight or a dame either during their tenure, or immediately after their departure."") A week after she stepped down as head of the CPS, it was announced that the CPS had agreed to a five-figure settlement with broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree and bailed repeatedly for a year over unfounded sex charges before being told he would not be charged. Samuel Armstrong, a former Conservative MP's chief of staff who was acquitted of rape, said the settlement was a ""damning indictment"" that ""should act as the final nail in the coffin for her hopes of a damehood."" He added: ""Saunders' one-woman crusade to shift the scales of justice in sex cases not only ruined the lives of dozens of young men but of Paul Gambaccini as well."""
In 2019 Saunders joined the law firm Linklaters as Dispute Resolution Partner.
"Saunders is married to Neil Saunders, a lawyer, and has two sons."
"Saunders was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2013 New Year Honours ""for services to Law and Order especially after the 2011 London Riots"" and Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to criminal justice."
= = = The Prophecies of Nostradamus = = =
"The Prophecies of Nostradamus is a 1979 television film based on the writings of Nostradamus. It was also known as ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow""."
"Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, the ""Captain Cook"", under Captain Henry Lawrie, and the ""Experiment"", under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel, Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the ""Experiment"" under James Strange, but this is probably a mistake."
"The strait lies between the Mainland and Vancouver Island portions of the Mount Waddington Regional District, a form of regional municipal governance with power over zoning, building and sewer permits and inter-municipal integration. Most communities in the region, however, are Indian reserve communities of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples which are outside the jurisdiction of regional district governance. The traditional territories of most of the various Kwakwaka'wakw peoples overlap in the strait, which is a vital fishery resource and transportation link between their communities."

"Interfaith Alliance is an interfaith organization in the United States founded in 1994. Its stated goal is to protect faith and freedom by respecting individual rights, protecting the boundaries between religion and government, and uniting diverse voices to challenge extremism and build common ground."
"Interfaith Alliance has members from more than 75 faith traditions and belief systems, in addition to many persons who follow no religious tradition."
"In January 2016, Rabbi Moline was named President of Interfaith Alliance. Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy is the President Emeritus and continues to host Interfaith Alliance's weekly State of Belief Radio program."
"In January 2015, Rabbi Jack Moline had been named Executive Director of Interfaith Alliance."
"Interfaith Alliance and its partner organization, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, work out of their main office in Washington, D.C.. The group has local affiliates around the United States."
"Interfaith Alliance realizes the powerful role that religion plays in America, and it values the positive impact that religious belief can have on American politics. However, Interfaith Alliance's concern is that religion and the United States government are becoming dangerously entangled. Interfaith Alliance believes that religion is being manipulated as a tool to influence policy and advance political strategy. Interfaith Alliance works to ensure the sanctity of religion and the integrity of politics. The group also supports an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"In 2019, Interfaith Alliance joined with 42 other religious and allied organizations in issuing a statement opposing Project Blitz, an effort by a coalition of Christian right organizations to influence state legislation."
= = = Richmond River cod = = =
"The Richmond River cod was a form of ""Maccullochella"" cod, now believed to have been eastern freshwater cod, ""Maccullochella ikei"", that occurred naturally in the Richmond River system, an east coast river system in north-east New South Wales, Australia."
"Eastern freshwater cod in turn are a species of ""Maccullochella"" cod found in east coast drainages and originating from Murray cod, ""Maccullochella peelii"", that crossed the Great Dividing Range and entered east coast drainages from a river capture event between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 million years ago)."
"Richmond River cod are extinct, from overfishing, habitat destruction including gross siltation, and whole-of-catchment scale bushfires and fish kills in the 1930s."
"The Richmond River system has now been restocked with small numbers of eastern freshwater cod from the Clarence River system, but these appear to have been insufficient to re-establish populations; there is no evidence of these stocked fish reproducing as yet."
= = = Delta Force: Black Hawk Down = = =
"Delta Force: Black Hawk Down is a first-person shooter video game developed by NovaLogic. It was released for Microsoft Windows on March 23, 2003; for Mac OS X in July 2004; and for PlayStation 2 and Xbox on July 26, 2005. It is the 6th game of the ""Delta Force"" series. It is set in the early 1990s during the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The missions take place primarily in the southern Jubba Valley and the capital Mogadishu. The game also features a mission editor with which players can make custom missions."
"The gameplay in ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" differs heavily from earlier installments in the series. While all earlier ""Delta Force"" games focus on long distance outdoor combat and have open ended mission design, ""Black Hawk Down"" focuses on close quarters combat in urban environments with heavily scripted missions more similar to the then-recent . Many of the series' trademark features, such as bullet ballistics and later weapon sway, were abandoned in favour of simpler action-focused gameplay. The player is usually accompanied by a squad of three AI-controlled soldiers, whom the player is able to give simple commands such as the order to hold fire, hold position or throw a grenade."
"Like in earlier ""Delta Force"" games the campaign in ""Black Hawk Down"" is divided into distinct missions. While the campaign is linear, most of the time three missions are available at the same time, allowing the player to complete them in any order. Completing a mission saves the campaign progress and usually unlocks a new one. Already completed missions can be accessed from an ""instant action"" list."
"In addition to the singleplayer campaign, ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" features LAN and online multiplayer with support for up to 50 players in a single match, breaking the record for the largest console multiplayer battles at the time."
"The online multiplayer is powered by NovaWorld which tracks players' statistics, gives them increasing ranks and has a matchmaking system. Various gameplay modes are available including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill as well as objective-based ones. Like in the previous two ""Delta Force"" games players can choose one out of several character classes with individual characteristics."
"The player begins the game as a soldier with Task Force Ranger, commanding 3 team members: Huck, Mother, and Preacher. They take part in the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation during the Somali Civil War. Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of the same soldier. He/she is assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player will still play as that soldier, but is now sent to the 3rd Ranger Battalion and the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force."
The final mission features an alternate history in which the player and a team of operators carry out the assassination of Mohammad Farrah Aidid.
"""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" uses an engine based on ""Comanche 4"" which allows for more detail and advanced visual effects thanks to shader support. Also vehicle movement is not restricted to specific pre-defined paths anymore and the AI drivers are able to avoid obstacles. It is the first engine used by the series to support platforms other than PC."
"In 2004 an expansion pack titled """" was released for the PC and PlayStation 2 versions of the game, adding two campaigns which take place in Colombia and Iran respectively."
"""Black Hawk Down""s computer version received a ""Silver"" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom."

= = = Etihad Rail DB = = =
"Etihad Rail DB is a certified and integrated heavy-rail Operations & Maintenance (O&M) service provider in the UAE. The company was set up in 2013 as a joint venture between Etihad Rail (51%), the developer of the UAE's national railway network and Deutsche Bahn (DB) (49%), Europe's largest railway operator and infrastructure owner. Etihad Rail DB is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Stage One of the UAE's national railway network for Etihad Rail’s primary customer, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Etihad Rail DB concluded an Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Agreement with Etihad Rail in August 2013."
"Stage One is the first of three stages of the UAE's vision to build a mixed freight and passenger railway across the country. Stages Two and Three will extend the railway geographically to the other Emirates as well as connect with partner Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway systems in the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Not only will the UAE's railway provide a valuable boost to sustainable and diversified economic growth and bring communities together across the Emirates, it will also be a concrete step to the development of a safe, more efficient and integrated system movement of freight and people across the region."
"In Stage One of the UAE's national railway network, Etihad Rail DB operates and maintains 264 km of railway route across the Western Region of the Abu Dhabi Emirate and transports granulated sulphur from the sour gas fields of Shah (Al Hosn Gas) and Habshan (GASCO) to the port of Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, where the sulphur product is exported. The spine of the network is the double track line between Liwa and Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi. This section is designed to also operate passenger trains in the future."
"Etihad Rail DB is now set to provide 'Shadow Operator' services for stage two of the Etihad Rail project. The choice builds on the five years of expertise and Etihad Rail DB's outstanding success in managing Stage One operations and maintenance. In its 'Shadow Operator' role, Etihad Rail DB will aim to utilise its expertise and lessons learned from Stage One to provide consultancy services to Etihad Rail in preparation for stage two. Such services will include reviewing the design of stage two assets, developing Emiratization requirements, drawing up operational procedures and safety management plans and assisting to ensure the project is delivered with the optimum operations cost."
"Since officially commencing commercial operations in January 2016, Etihad Rail DB has been responsible for the transport of up to 22,000 tonnes of granulated sulphur every day in trains of up to 110 wagons. Trains are hauled by 4,300 horsepower EMD SD-70 locomotives. In February 2017, Etihad Rail DB announced that it had safely run its 1,000th train for ADNOC. As of 20 January 2017, Etihad Rail DB confirmed that it had transported more than 10 million tonnes of sulphur in over 1 million hours worked with zero lost time injury (LTI) in a relatively short time since inception, which reflects its internal culture."
"As of the first half of 2017, Etihad Rail DB had achieved its highest performance records against all international safety standards with no lost-time injuries. As railways are new to the region, a community safety campaign was undertaken in 2014 to educate the public on safety around rail tracks."
"One of the key purposes of the Etihad Rail DB joint-venture is to facilitate knowledge transfer, the sharing of best practices, as well as providing the UAE with a world-class, modern, integrated and efficient rail network that will drive economic growth and social development. In May 2016, Etihad Rail and Etihad Rail DB co-signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education & Training Institute (ADVETI) related to occupational training. Under the terms of this MoU, the stakeholders will collaborate to create opportunities for occupational training and share knowledge for Emirati students seeking qualifications in the UAE's rail industry, in line with the goals of the country's Emiratization policy. This means that UAE Nationals will have skills across many disciplines needed to operate and maintain the railway such as maintenance and mechanical technicians. Moreover, Etihad Rail DB has also established a human resources excellence programme which is enabling UAE nationals to gain on-the-job experience."

"Hermann Landois (19 April 1835, Münster – 29 January 1905) was a German zoologist. He was the brother of physiologist Leonard Landois (1837-1902)."
"He studied natural sciences and theology in Münster, where he was ordained as a priest in 1859. In 1863 he obtained his doctorate in zoology at the University of Greifswald, later becoming an associate professor of zoology at the Academy in Münster (1873)."
"In 1871 he founded the ""Westfälischen Vereins für Vogelschutz, Geflügel- und Singvögelzucht"" (Westphalian Association for bird protection, poultry and songbird breeding), and during the following year founded the ""Zoologischen sektion für Westfalen und Lippe"" (Zoological Division of Westphalia and Lippe)."
"In 1875, he founded the Westphalian zoo in Munster, a preserve with emphasis on European domestic mammals. It had a building for the display, cultivation and breeding of various fowl as well as avaries for songbirds. In 1876 a ""monkey house"" was constructed. Eventually, the zoo expanded to include native fauna in general. By the end of 1882, the site had ""niche displays"" (dioramas) representing fauna from Australia, the North Sea coast, German forests, the African landscape, as well as a section that contained fossils from prehistoric Westphalia."
