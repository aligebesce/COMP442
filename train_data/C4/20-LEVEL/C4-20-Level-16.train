I bet you're all wondering what that is in the
"erm, I'm just not getting it"
"unknown territory, you know what it's like with a van, don't you, and then"
yeah
gotta get done
Yeah
"I'm arguing with them, when I'm"
"I give it a break for a couple of, well about three Sundays now"
"Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my babe  I'm a tell her, we've, we've"
"I mean, a couple of them I like"
"I remember a go, a go with some of them that I thought I could do, but realised I can't do, do you know what I mean?"
"I, I, I was, about, what I, I do, I bought an Elvis Presley one er a Tom Jones one, that drinks one, you know, that I like, it's, it's"
"well I like singing it, what I mean, I think what it is I'm looking for the old, I'm not being funny, I'm looking for the old voice"
"I don't like me voice, I'm not liking it at all and I think that's what putting me off on taping it and listening to myself after, I don't, I like, I like to"
"I shouldn't do it, I'm not gonna do it any more, I'm not gonna tape me own voice and listen to it  I just"
not listening to me own voice
"Left a good job in the city, working for a man"
"Yeah, quite smooth actually"

"nice number that, er nice number, you see like that song, like you've choose"
Well I can tell you that
"it's actually this one, it's not a"

"They come through the doorstep, through the doors though."
Through the door they they just throw them away.
They didn't read them.
"I said well don't you live in Stortford, didn't you have it delivered?"
No.
And I'm sure they'll pick them up if they see them in the
If they printed
print them up and they do it on their own  will.
Couldn't we do it with him?
With him?
Well yeah pro
I mean they could couldn't they sponsor us to do it or something?
"Well yeah I I've I've  whether he  well I mean if, if he's gonna do this seven page thing then  I you know I  you can look at it two ways."
Either we can influence and help that to be  to be good or or  you know if that's a failure then  see whether they can help us to produce one for the town.
Mm.
I mean I'd much rather they do it  if we can influence him enough.
They've got the right information.
"Well the thing if we did it with our  as they keep saying there's some, there's so much in the pipeline."
I mean it might take us another  two week two months before we get it out.
Three months.
Well
I would say six months.
Yeah
No I would just think of something really straightforward.
"They do want stuff on local levels I mean if he's East Herts he's got a huge area, hasn't he?"
Yeah.
It it might be a help to him to have little local groups that  helped him out with these things.
But I mean if we print something and then suddenly they instal all these new bottle banks which we didn't know about.
Then they are not mentioned
Well
in our recycling directory and we can do the next one
Pine pastures green to the tops of Ben Dorain and and up Black Mount where the Craig estate took it was it was in their estate.
So therefore my father was very keen to go too.
Mm.
And that's how we decided to go.
So Dalmally I should safely say was my first schooling.
Even though I was about eight and a half.
Mm.
Now your father was the the stocker at Tormore is that right ?
Yes he was the stocker at Tormore.
Who was he employed with then?
Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in Canada on the C P R.
Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in  out to Canada.
Mm.
What d'ya recall of your early days with your father at Tormore?
Pardon?
What d'ya recall of your early days at Tormore with your father?
Well  he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of  as you would say because we had sheep then.
And if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down.
Mm.
Without a collie dog.
And well I remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as I grew up myself.
So he was  and it had it's Tormore House was really a lovely place.
Did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate?
Yes.
Oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to Inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then.
But they were good metal roads that took all the traffic.
Well I remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside Tormore House and many's the day I was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead.
A Hugh .
No  relation but a great friend of ours.
He was a steam roller driver.
Mm.
And were the gentry in er Lochassynt Lodge or was it Tormore?
Well Traidcraft's got loads to sell.
Not doing very well are you
No!
because I have this  erm dilemma.
Whether to just photocopy off a very good  original
Yeah
or do we print the whole lot.
And we came to the conclusion it was cheaper to print
Oh
than photocopy.
What  it's a bit slow isn't it?
"Yeah it depends, well you can get get it to run through copies but  the problem is that the cartridges for these printers they, they cost about fifty pounds."
Mm
They're not cheap.
So if I can do one run and then photocopy it.
Mm.
It a is actually a lot better because you can get them usually get them down to about  five p a copy.
"Well won't you lose, lose definition on the drawing though with a laser printer?"
No.
No?
No it's even better
Oh that's alright.
"Okay, no it's, I'm just going by the one at school and it, because it's all made up of little dots you"
"No, this is a laser printer."
This does it absolutely  it's not a dot printer it's it is a laser printer .
"Oh, well he keeps calling it his laser printer!seen it in action we don't see that well."
"So you, you said you could do it for five p a copy?"
"Well I r , I r , I reckon I reckon you can down to that, yeah."
That's printing both sides.
Yeah.
double sided printer and I I'll try and get that verified but
I think we could sell it I think we could sell it for
right John has written a story about his home  right it's a good descriptive story on how people live
until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it.
My home.
"I live in a tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister."
"Our house is made of wood and is dark green, we have a four windows and four doors."
It has got wooden roof.
"There is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm  because we climb the, the tree and climb it and  we play in the tree house today with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen here"
"Okay, right"
So if we cut out the one
they might
it might flow a bit more easily might it.
"That's good, it was alright apart from that you describe where John and"
are living well
"Yeah, I didn't see which sort of"
"No, did he describe the house though?"
Yeah
"Yeah, I think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear"
I think he could improve it just a bit Jonathan
"and then it might flow a bit more evenly, might it then, right Michael bring yours out now please."
"Just a minute John, right Michael I want you to read yours through once more for me please."
Do it about the monster
Monster from the marsh.
"When I saw the monster from the marsh, one night, I was, I was, I was frightened, I, I, I, I was  he looked liked a   when I saw him I ran back to camp and I felt frightened, I hid under my sleeping bag the end"
"Right, see Michael was describing that how he felt"
Yeah
How did feel then?
Frightened
You think that he came out quite
What Christine has said then do you think?
Well you said he went under a sleeping bag
Aha
No cos I wasn't too sure if it was available  you telling me it is available.
A as I said this morning t to the management team it is available.
The only problem is as a one-off exercise on
er existing jobs.
We will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit.
Including
Right.
all the variations and what not.
"And that's something that Mike  and Ken  will help dig the historical contracts out and, and suggest er a remit."
"Erm b cos, cos he, it prints a remit back out out the client ."
"But it, it, it's ready"
"When, when are we likely to, to have the contract reports available?"
The Q S
the physical works
The physical works.
Yeah.
"We're gonna start specifying that now and Brian will, will er"
Right.
"will start to, to, to work that up."
But of course that can become quite a complex thing depending on how much we want to sort of use it to produce certificates and things like that.
Right.
So that's gonna incorporate the Q S cost report as well as the physical works is it?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
"A and that's, that's gonna be quite a complex erm"
Right.
thing to specify.
As it's a p it's a pound to a penny
Mm.
"that, what we're doing at the moment, we won't want to b put it all in this system"
Fine.
Specially with Palace I think they seem to think  but they really .
Should have finished them off in that first
Yeah   Can I just flick the light on for a second?
Thank you.
"Yes, see who  I mean  I can't think of anybody who's in the reserves who could do any better than the lot that are in, in at the moment."
Can you?
"Other than perhaps give Colleymore a full blooded  game, right?"
Doesn't he get a full blooded game at the moment?
"I think perhaps it's, it's worth it now."
"The season, I mean we're not gonna come top of the league are we?"
Right?
We've gotta make sure we stay in the first division but
I think we can afford to blood Colimore as a good one now.
"He could have this whole of this season to get used to playing, right?"
Yeah.
And then who knows what fireworks could happen the season after.
I mean  he's never gonna be a  when he's obviously another Bright.
Who wants another Bright?
We're supposed to  to the better style of play.
"No, I don't know."
Well why did we buy Gabiadini?
Why?
What would be the point of buying Gabiadini?
"No, well I, I mean you saw the point really."
"I mean  to pick I mean who, who  who could replace ?"
"He's, I, he, the way he plays is virtually unique, isn't he?"
So I mean you're not gonna say  well let's go and get another Ian Wright off the peg so fair enough.
But er  in the kind of situation where Ian Wright was very very good was in tight situations.
differently through se sheer speed and  but er I can see Gabiadini  I mean Ian Wright never flicks like some of the flicks that he does.
I mean some of the flicks are fantastic.
But erm there is a nice side to his game but god he doesn't half fade.
"Can you afford somebody that fades like that, I don't know it's"
And then you'll need a P S V
Well
licence.
"but, but that's, that's  that's easily remedied if you could get a er  a driving licence holder  to take them  oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents  or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.
"But I did also say  to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them  after I've discussed with Miss ."
I only know one person  I only know one bus driver with children.
There's ambulance drivers.
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.
Er  this  letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
Yes.
Says any
that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're not
To sixteen.
you're not reducing the size of the bus.
Well I think that's crazy.
And someone who's been just used to driving a car  are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
Well
tuition?
"Well I, I"
Whether it's got  whether it's got sixteen people in it or  twenty nine
Well er
it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
I drive the minibus at the hospital
I know.
"which only takes four wheelchairs  and of course there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them."
"I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just"
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
No.
and just drive
Will it go in?
"Yeah, I'm sure it will."
Thank you
Thank you
"They're not really  are they, the Chinese or  Oriental dancers?"
"I don't think so anyway, they seem to be"
A lot of cars at the school this morning.
"I parked right on the end of the erm  the lane, just"
Mm
"in, there was just enough room for me."
Mm?
Course we were late anyway  well not late for John's but
Which way do you go
When I came back
into ?
Cos you can cut through that
"I turn round and go back, yeah."
Mm.
"And of course the coach had come up the hill  couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it."
Oh yeah
It was completely blocked off  coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it.
So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized that I was the one that had caused all that
and drove off
And ignored
Slinked off into the mist.
So he couldn't back back then
"No  no that wa that was it, completely stalemate."
"big Volvo estate was facing  if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and  he wasn't gonna do that."
Too much  brain damage
there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says
Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning.
", in olden days, before they built the er bridge."
When the all the traffic came across the level crossing there.
There's still a signal box there.
erm that's now a private house isn't it?
"Yeah, it's a listed building."
But er rather nice.
"And a barrow, a very common sight, and this this type of er of awning, erm very very common, er the barge-boarding er and the er and and the again the roof and the er chimneys and very interesting sort of a  In the garden erm of the sort of station master's house, is that."
Very much like er the style used er in coal offices and erm weigh weighbridge at .
That's still there.
"Erm where there's a caravan office, or caravan sales place just by the station, at , sorry at er ."
"Erm I remember er thinking one day, erm I must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar, I'll go back at the weekend and get that."
I went back at the weekend and it was a pile of rubble.
"And that is the danger if you don't do things at the sec at the time, because er things do get er knocked down."
"Nice little building, little Wendy House there."
.another picture of it.
just playing .
But er nice little summer house there.
now.
And let's just w just take one or two other pictures just for interest.
Just to show you a bit further on.

"Apparently we've got a mistake on the back of that form, that it referred to a noncompliance report, on the back, which is referring to the front but the front was called a quick-fix report"
you see?
"So I said, should I fill in a quick-fix report or a noncompliance report, to say that the quick-fix form, or is it a noncompliance report is wrong."
Right.

Mm.
"in keeping an idea of where the jobs are,"
Yeah.
and the comments I'm getting back from the er the clients are very very favourable.
Right.
They do find them extremely helpful.
Have you run off
C
any interim report from t the computer yet?
"It does actually say together with other said officers and committee members as shall be determined by a general meeting, so if we wish to elect or choose somebody else we can do."
"Erm, but there's be a good idea to have"
She's taken someone's .
"Well I think, we'll, we'll see what, we'll see what comes, if somebody else wishes to compete, compete for the Chair, the post of Chair, erm, then you may perhaps like to invite them to share the Chair with you, or, or, they can become the, the Vice Chair."
"Erm, erm, only too willing to welcome competition cos they're all to aware of my short comings, mm."
Mm.
"Erm, so."
"Well, if, if there isn't anybody else who wishes to  compete with you for the Chair, er, then I think there ought to be a Vice Chair."
Yeah.
Right.
"Now the other thing about, about the meeting is erm, we sometimes arrange for sort of special refreshments or something different in that line, it's at Ann's house, erm do you want, do you want us to do anything about that Ann or?"
"Yeah, interested in any spare wine glasses please."

"Shall I, shall I leave you and Mary to sort that out?"
Okay.
"Between you, mm, mm."
What date is it?.
"I'm not sure what date it is, I haven't got it on here have we really."
"I mean really it, it's erm  er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other?"
"Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean  it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox."
Yeah.
Maybe Jim and I could
And when they ring up
do that this avo
Yeah.
"When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your ?"
Now look this is meant to record
"this, this, this is meant to record"
"life as it is lived, English as she is spoken."
You're not meant to bite your tongue like that.
Right.
Yeah if we
You can swear in the privacy of your own home.
It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of
not the tape actually
yes alright
"No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number"
"And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through."
Yeah that'd be a good idea
Write the name and address and phone number down and then
Yeah.
it's there.
Okay I'll buy that.
Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back.
Yeah.
Even if it's to say erm
Oh sorry!
sorry we've got enough.
Yeah okay.
"Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing."
Did he come with the start of the scheme then really?
"No well it wasn't the scheme he worked on, he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that, maintenance, the maintenance side."
"Er other thing, and they lived down there opposite the garage, that was the electricity board house then."
So would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself?
I ca I came here in nineteen sixty one.
Sixty one.
Mhm.
"That's when I got married, nineteen sixty one, I came up."
What did you think of  when you came ?
"Well it was just a quiet wee village just  I had come, wasn't much different it was quiet as well."
Mhm.
And er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really.
"Everybody was very friendly, it didn't matter whether you were an incomer or not, they always spoke."
Mhm.
You got to know people  very quick  in .
"That was one thing about the village, and your your neighbour would where Jane is the now, I don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in Dumfries, but here they were always you know"
You couldn't get away from them.
Oh they were in or out.
So did you do any singing when you came here first?
What was the first kind of thing you got involved in ?
"Oh the rural choir, I forgot about that, yes, I joined the rural choir and ."
"And er I couldn't sight read or anything like, I can't sight read."
"But I can remember once when I was at the school Mrs  was our music teacher and we were to go from doh to far, you know doh to far, and they used to s , she used to say listen to Mabel, Mabel's the only one one of you that can go from doh to far."
But er  so when we came Mrs  the sight reading of course I was lost because she used to
Is that Mrs John ?
No Mrs Billy.
Billy.
She used to take the rural choir.
How long had it been going then when you came?
"Oh it had been going for quite some time, I don't know really when they would start."
Was it all ladies ?
"Mhm, yes, oh aye, all ladies."
Erm then.
"And er so I mean it's you know, I am a politician I mean you know, it's in the blood I've b been in the in the House of Commons now for about a quarter of a century."
"Over a quarter of a century, most of it on the front bench."
And erm I like it.
"But the fact is I mean I you know, you do ask these questions, your family make you ask these questions quite understandably."
I there are other things I could do.
I'm a manic gardener and I that's what I've been doing.
"Erm I could go back to commerce, although er that side of my life is some way behind and it it's always been very successfully done by er my colleagues in the company that I started."
"So er you know I I've I've never had a sort of er a one way track about politics, although I adore it and I've er I've enjoyed it hugely Am enjoying it and I"
"Ah I was going to pick  you said, I have enjoyed it hu I was about to leap in and say, Ah that means ."
Yes ye no no no no no no.
How kind.
"Well that's the value of a programme like this, you can correct."
Otherwise that'd be over the headlines.
"Heseltine says, Future"
Quite.
is in the past.
You know
Which is not exactly what I am saying.
Erm no the fact is that er I I love politics.
It's er and and I have always wanted to be president of the board of trade.
"But what about more ambition, further ambition now?"
Well that's a sort of wary question but all politicians
But you'd expect me to ask it.
I know you're bound to ask it.
And you I'm not going to give any different answer I've ever given.
I my belief is that John Major will win the next election.
"I helped to win the last one, I shall help to win the next one."
"And er er I I think that er all this sort of chat about leadership challenges and all that, I think that's for the birds."
I don't think we shall see it.
I especially I don't think so after after the very er impressive speech he made on Friday.
But there is We can come to that in a moment if we may.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there."
"And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the"
"or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty"
Yes.
there's very limited facilities for children to play.
So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh .
"Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things."
So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea.
Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital.
"I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry."
It's gonna be a week  .
So she wanted to know what date it is.
"So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details."
"And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all."
"And that she was going on Wednesday, I think."
Up she went  you know
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which
It's
one?
Mrs  was going to see Miss
Was going to see Miss
.
Oh.
I see.
I didn't know which one.
But I give them a  so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday    when I was at Ashington.
And she came up with all sorts of things that  she would like for the  the new Wandsbergh development.
"But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so th there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time."
"So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth."
A word.
"It was, well it is, you, you stick in pieces of articles, into a book, you're collecting them."
Just any articles?
"Well, they have to correspond to the lecture, so  the lecture this week was, world population."
Had to so it.
"Like the world,"
And business?
the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then, you have to get to about three to four articles on that."
I don't know where I'm gonna get them from.
And then
World in
"It, it gets a bit easier, because they go on to like health, age, I know I'll be able to find loads to stuff on age, won't I?"
"World population, erm probably what I'm gonna have to do is, although they, they said you can't do it  don't get any ideas about doing it with  because it's not possible."
It is possible
Mm.
"cos if I find that I can't find something, I'll just have to look like"
Keep looking as you're going along
"Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
"So, that's what  is."
"And it's just like, and they want you to make some comment on what you've worked out, which is no problem really, is it?"
"Do you know that newspaper that they brought out, the European, and it's like, just to, just to"
Yeah.
take you through the whole of Europe.
Yeah.
"like world issues, then,"
Yeah.
Because
"I know the Telegraph always have a lot of foreign, foreign news."
"But that's what, but The Sunday Times has always got a world news section at the back in it."
Alright

Okay so putting all the  that positive
Yeah sort of ums and ahs
Oh right okay okay so I mean are are you saying that's about confidence?
Is it or  ?
"Well maybe , maybe, maybe thinking ahead too much"

"Mum, mum watch this, are you watching."
You have to lose a race now and again.
"Yeah, but she ain't even,"
"Are you watching,"
"er, what was was I saying, the  I don't know what George has  all the customers, I mean, she's isn't even particularly"
"isn't she, she's not what you call really bonny, she ain't got a right bonny face."
I know she's got a nice figure.
"She's as thick as two short planks, she's got a dirty mouth."
"I mean, I, you know, maybe"
I can't understand  your cross.
I know.
Cannot understand  or something.
Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese.
"Plenty of different people  cheap, er,the other people who have different likes to you, but what, what you might think's attrac attractive, somebody else'll"
Yeah.
"won't be, you know."
"To be quite honest, without talking like a school  on a fence."
"They're not very happy, they ain't been happy for a while, but it's getting worse,wh is, what is them now is, you know I say things to Colin, and Co I mean, Colin'll tell me like, you know, you know,over there, and er, he's latest thing is, they built this little office."
"You know when you go into  on the right, er a coal-house and a wash- house ain't there."
Yeah.
"The coal-house part it's is quite wide now we've done it, big coal-house, but altered"
"And then it twists, and like a small office, and when when I were there, after Michael had shown it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in here to get get out of way, and you know, he was like telling me, I thought I don't want to be a fiddle, because it's alright telling Colin, the boys"
"telling yeah,"
Yeah.
"ain't it, yeah, it's not like a woman telling you problems."
Don't knock my dusters off.
"Anyway, I just said, well, summat about  about what I said, I says, yeah,nice to get away from it all, ain't it, to be by yourself, and that's all I said, and I think he knew that I I didn't want to"
"but, and he said to Colin"
Do we need them
Bilingual?
bilingual?
They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council.
No.
And the other thing er if they  they just haven't got anything like that.
Yeah.
They use sort of blank
Wasn't there a big fuss though because  there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side  the last survey we did?
I don't think so was there?
There's a letter in the file
Well that's
about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates.
"Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints."
But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem.
"Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave  saying that every  you know, possible thing was done to  get bilingual staff but at the end of the day  you know they couldn't come up with the goods."
"I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now."
"They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers  the job centre only came up with about two people."
So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation.
"I wonder if, I wonder if erm  you know if you rang up erm  the county council and said   you know   I mean er  y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family"
Yeah.
You know?
It maybe
Yeah.
You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often  I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it.
Yeah.
"It may be, you know?"
Yeah.
See how the response goes with this and then
Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth?
Er Gwyllam .
And where is he?
Eh
But certainly the main co-ordinators er
"Almost like the burglar alarm  you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in"
We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because
No
that'd be a mammoth task
If you have somebody like  somewhere like that
"I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know"
Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
Yes
"I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them"
"Well, this is something I've just done myself"
Yeah
"but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but"
"it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I"
Yeah
"think about it, but"
I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you?
No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
"So you know who they are, yeah"
Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm  out and then they just go through the system
And you also get sometimes two people off the same street
Well that's it
It's just a reference they want you  Mr Smith two doors away
Well I've had one for Basingfield or Basingfield
"Oh I spoke to her, yeah"
"yeah, I've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread"
and that's a
You know for the er village
"Well have you spoken to Sergeant  to alleviate all the paperwork, and"
yeah yeah
Well when when it was first read by erm  it was mentioned that it had been written by the Green Party by radio four and the Guardian and the Independent.
And as far as I know that's the only coverage I've seen personally of it.
"Well I s I saw an article in erm the Green Alliance, a fairly shadowy organization , er mentioned in their newsletter."
It was it was erm promoted by the association of conservation of energy.
Mhm.
So I rang them up .
But that's yeah I haven't seen much.
Yeah it's supported by the
Well no they said they said prepared by er
Oh right.
What is the Green Alliance?
I don't really know.
I don't know who they get their money from but they.
I mean they used to provide the advisor to various secretaries of state I think didn't they?
Ooh
I don't know who they are really.
They send out this newsletter anyway.
But I mean the main the main I mean in it in certain quarters we've been down playing that aspect of it simply to get it through.
Sure.
But er all of the main organizations that have  you know World Wide  and Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and so on and Age Concern.
They all know they were all told that it's it's all a bit above board.
But in promoting it to MPs we've been drawing their attention to the kinds of organizations which in turn in their eyes just sort of represent that pyramid or structure of votes that .
And of course when it goes through they already have our our as it were
Yeah.
With a bit of luck and careful handling.
"And the MPs who who asked to put it forward including Alan  they they had to you know they came to Ron  to ask, Can we put your bill forward."
They all know Ron anyway .
He's a very old hand in lobbying er which shows it's how it's we've got it this far.
Mm.
Because he's known this labyrinth  rubbish that they cling to.
Okay shall we move on to billboards?
Mm.
can!
The sheep to cross the road and
Mm.
quite unusual!
I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
"I can remember when you'd see  a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away  and this would be  a flock of sheep."
"Course, they hadn't had  lorries in them days, they drive them on the road  and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs  and goodness knows how many sheep!"
"And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there."
"And er  if you see it was coming towards  of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way  course the dust still keep going."
But  but of course this was many years ago.
Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.
It's all done with cars.
You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
It er  oh!
"It used to be  occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time  different shows and that."
"So many sheep  or, ha  show time see, you see these flocks of shop  but now you always"
Been to a cattle market.
That's a long time ago because se the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!
I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here  and that down here at Upton bypass  and all
Oh yes!
what they call Upton bypass.
Yeah.
Oh it was er  cry over war wound!
Oh!
Horses will never be able to stand on it!
It's slippery and that.
What a state they were in then!
"My father had er, horses at that time and  my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses  they were talking about this one day and  uncles would say  well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that  road's were nice and solid."
"Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them."
"But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be."
Yeah.
An oh!
"and just, I hid under my sleeping bag, er, then, I thought er the mon what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on, you know, all, all night"
John
"Well he did say that the monster was rather large, he looked like a bird"
with some feathers plucked out
What else could you bring in his bag?
Anything else he could of put in the hat Liam?
"He vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping, but he didn't describe"
"Where, where"
"Yeah, where"
So he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back
Yeah
"and what he went through in, in"
that couldn't he?
Yeah
"Right, the people who have not read an essay out yet, I want you to sit, just a minute Michael, next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please, right boys do that now then, yes, could you take yours to show"
please
Do we have to show both?
Not sure  it's still working.
It's still working
The thingy
Is it recording us?
Is it recording?
Yeah
My dad's got all this
"Sorry Steve, erm,"
that you're not going to read your essay and
and that isn't
"essay, either work your book or, and get it"
"er, yes, well it has to be up"
and when you've finished it you can then do a picture about your
"Right erm, can I start by asking you, can you tell me your full name please?"
and they had to they had to sit in rows and they had to do as they were told and they weren't allowed
Ha!
to speak.
Yes.
Apparently some of the children got quite scared of Jan cos Jan played the part so well  ah Joan  for life.
Frightened the life out of them.
Yeah.
Ah back ah back ah back and bill .
So what did John look like perhaps like a little Billy Bunter didn't he?
"Ah no he looked very good he had a gown and a mortar board and cane  and bow tie  and pin striped socks, quite good, yep."
And they wore that all day all of them all day?
"All day and then he got  all to do   at lunch time  yeah they kept it up all the day, they had separate play time, they had had to eat their lunch in the class room  all they were allowed was a piece of fruit, a bread and water  and they all had to have, you know, they had a bread roll  supplied by the school  an a an apple I think    And Jan made them write out their names and some of them couldn't write their name!"
Boy called Daniel couldn't write Daniel cos all last year he'd been allowed to put Danny  an he'd forgotten how to write Daniel!
Search me!
How old's that child?
Ten  and John
And he can't
"that's what's so dreadful, Joe was language coordinator and they came from her!"
Can't write names.
And another boys name was Thomas   and he couldn't write that cos all last year he'd been Tom  an he'd forgotten how to write his surname  they're not dim children  both of them
Frightening isn't it?
family  she says  quite an eye opener  an they had write lines if they did anything wrong  one boy just   I reckon she could carried him but
No.
You can't be  three times    Where's tonight gone?
All this stuff in out here shall I?
"You think you're exhausted after a days work imagine if you've been doing that all day long, shouting"
Look!
"and shrieking, no I mean that"
I shout and shriek all day long!
Ooh I'll lose my voice up there today  we've done some really good things though  try and do see more my hall is very full  if he bothered to come to school he'd have seen them!
Still  find those  what's this that's broken from?
But Mummy you could
I never did like those open topped buses.
Well unclear
So I'll be back to you.
at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses.
Can you?
Yes.
No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today.
"There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower."
Is that right?
That's right yeah.
There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you?
Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure.
I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael.
Well are tourists
"They could walk, why don't they walk?"
It's a seven kilometre tour.
It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus.
What did the Minister of Health say the other day?
Obesity obesity and lack of exercise.
and that's what you're encouraging Rachael .
Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide.
You still got that beautiful blonde hair?
We're not on the air are we?
No no no we're not on the air.
Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air  would I ?
Anyway so go on.
Right.
What were we talking about?
So you don't mind
Talking about the buses.
Yeah.
"So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit."
You'll be knackered.
I know.
Er yeah so we'll have this thing at Arrow Park to do.
He's hoping to do that.
"We'll looking into doing  we need to know how many cars gone in, how many cars go out"
Into the ?
of the hospital grounds.
But there's residential sections as well.
And then see how long each vehicle stayed there.
There's two entra entrances
You'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car!
That's what we are doing.
Jesus god!
It's probably because they're taking over the er  accident and emergency department from Clatterbrick it's shutting down and it's all going to Arrow Park.
Well that's not why we're doing it.
Well it is.
"That's what's happening, it was on the radio the other day."
This is just  well I mean it maybe connected with that but we're doing it because they want to increase the car parks .
So we're looking to do it with tape recorders  on the busiest entrance  and you know and just say car D five one four R G M  blah blah blah.
Get them all down   and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down.
But  you don't necessarily have to say the whole number.
You know you can just say D five one four.
"Well that's what you wanna, so much quicker wouldn't it, just say the Escort D five one four."
"Yeah, you don't even have to say the  the make."
"And then  erm they all get punched into the, Rob's got a special computer programme thing, you punch them all in  er  and then it does a ma a matching thing."
"And it  come, at the end of the day it comes out with all the ones it's matched, the duration it's been there  and er makes it a damned sight easier basically."
Should be quite good.
Then we've got  in June we're supposed to be doing journey time surveys and traffic counts on the M sixty three.
"I won't get off at this one, no?"
No.
I'll get off at the
Erm now they're talking of doing roadside interviews in both directions on the motorway on the slip roads.
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Wouldn't Sue do them?
She hasn't got a
hasn't she?
"I bet she had, I bet she had er"
no I know she's got a
You really want one with a three
I thought she had a band saw no
I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you?
And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you?
"Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there"
"huge, to that their costs mm"
I'll have to pay
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw
thirty pound a tooth
"Yeah, god worse than"
erm
"mm, how many have you got to now cut?"
"and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there?"
"I haven't got anything that deep, the"
only goes to about five inches
"What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you"
No
Why?
"at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off"
To reverse them
and turn it over
"Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way"
To make your first cut
Yeah
you have to take the guard off and the
"knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm  where's the guard goes at the top"
That right?
They say unless you've been unemployed six months you're not unemployed.
You're looking for a job.
They don't call it unemployed.
Well you can't go on the list for six weeks anyway.
Six months.
"six weeks, yeah."
"Well if you haven't been working for six months you are looking for a job, you are not unemployed."
They don't call that unemployment.
Course this is all  voting   propaganda again.
I mean when is it  it's a disgrace to the social service workers isn't it?
To make them wear uniform.
They're getting them like prison officers and policeman and
Well it's the same as anywhere else.
If you work in Marks and Spencers you wear er their uniform.
If you work in the hospital you wear their uniform.
Yeah.
That's only to advertise the place though isn't it?
Marks and Spencers and
It isn't.
If you went into your Clarke's shoe shop they've all got the same clothes.
"It's it makes it so easy that  the staff, one can't dress any better than the other."
They're all equal.
When you go to places like  in the big stores  the staff have all got the same type of apron er overall.
"And that's for the customer, if it needs help they know who is who to go for advice."
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But when you've got people stood behind a desk and serving you and doing nothing but serving you as you come.
They'll be wanting bank clerks to have uniforms next.
Good god bank clerks have been wearing uniforms for these last three four five years.
Oh I've never seen them.
Well
what's the point in making them worse.
I know.
"So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years."
I'll manage the way I am.
"You see, that works where I"
Benjy
"Aye,"
"Benjy, look at 'im."
Benjy
"Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said corner, then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway."
"Then there's another long unit right at side of it, just enough to get one trailer in."
"I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do start finding out that it's going alright, he'll turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop."
"And like,"
Yeah.
"A spray area, then"
Yeah.
Employ a sprayer.
"So, I mean, we know what we want, but  it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean,"
"Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work  as well."
"It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months ,"
Yeah.
you could be struggling to keep it above
Yeah.
"and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills."
No.
"I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under."
"Yeah, because of it."
Because of it.
Yeah.
"They don't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya."
I know.
"When you look you see everything's a bloody risk,"
"Well,actually  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it"
"Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation"
Yeah.
"and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up"
.
Wonder what ever came of that.
"Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head"
"Yeah, I know , he does versify."
and within three seconds my brain just switches off .
Well I try to
.
"I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany,cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away"
"suddenly cross your legs, ouch ."
That's a good idea.
"She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more."
"I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant  being a mother in law you have to watch it."
", honestly you couldn't be much worse than ."
Oh  mother in law is.
.
She's just .
"I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to , but erm, you know, she,."
"As a person, you know, I'd never have any time ."
"Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money"
", they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane."
"No, of course, of course ."
"So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at  gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the  Christmas present ."
It so .
I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I .
I couldn't I'm afraid.
"Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous"
Why was she?
she didn't want Vaughany to get married again.
"as he thought, authenticate it"
"What, what they call it, stressing it don't they?"
"Stressing it, yeah stressing it"
Mm
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable
"contortionist, it says here"
oh
Mm
"but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of"
"Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish"
Yeah
which it turned out to be wax
Oh
to simulate old varnish you see?
Oh
So then he started looking
Yeah
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers
"Yeah  I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that."
"I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in"
"beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future  you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's"
"things that are in there, it's astronomical."
"Mm, quite expensive as you say"
"Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right  oh he said that heaven"
Mm
"yeah, you do  huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?"
Yes  mm
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
No I haven't read that yet
"She's is a, quite a"
"character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you don't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to"
Mm pick on you
"if you said I made a suggestion, what sort of word would that be?"
"Come on, you're all asleep, now a suggestion what would that be?"
A nou
"Yes come on Charlie be brave, a noun, yes, a something isn't it, a, if you write a or the in front of a word it's usually a noun, okay, so just keep listening for the a and the."
"The next one, Trevor"
Erm beware
"Beware, right and a sentence please"
Beware of Frankenstein
Beware of Frankenstein.
Charlie
Erm
third one down
I had a nightmare last night
You had a nightmare last night.
What happened in your nightmare?
Don't know
Come back to life again
because when you woke up this morning
and the next one
Juggle
Juggle
"Erm, I know a clown that juggles"
I know a clo a clown that juggles.
"Why couldn't you actually have J U G, one G, L E?"
why couldn't you have the spelling J U G L E?
Something would happen to the L
Something would happen not to the L but to the vowel.
"Hello  I'm terribly busy Norma actually, I've got a full lesson at the minute, erm, I'll, I'll try and, and sort that out as soon as I've finished this lesson"
"okay, thanks for telling me Norma"
"thank you, bye ."
Jugle
"Yes because what happens when you've got just a very thin L, the magic E can even work through it, U, right, so it will be jugle , yeah,jugle , that wouldn't be the right pronunciation at all, okay, let's go on to the next one"
"Most graphs will keep going on up, and there's a tendency for people to make them come back down again"
Mm.
or at least to where they started.
That means it's going backwards.
"Erm  now you don't do, paper three, you don't do  velocity time graphs, but you probably do them in physics don't you?"
You would do them in physics.
It's just like pure coincidence.
Aha!
Oh that's a good one that.
Revising it yesterday to be honest.
That's a good one.
got all pictures in it.
"Yes it has, but these are, those are, I've seen those before and they are very nice graphs, I would recommend them to anyone."
Right.
"So, you were revising them yesterday."
Should I
"Well the big thing, ah."
"See, it's very easy to get confused between distance against time, speed against time, and even acceleration against time."
"Yeah, because I mean it had them in our exam,"
Right.
"in our mock, we had like those four pictures, and you had to say which was"
"It comes up time and time again, and you have to know the difference between the different types."
"So  you also, when you get used to each type individually, need to then be able to switch between"
Mm.
between one and the other.
Yeah.
"So if we've got erm  acceleration against time and we get, no, no peeping."
No peeping.
"We get a flat one, what does that mean?"
"It's  Every one second, you've gone further."
We haven't gone anywhere
we've measured the acceleration.
That's the only way.
"Our cat, and I've really watched her  makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road."
And I think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists.
Not squeeze to the side because they might not see you there.
right
"Well you sh you're supposed to ride a fair way out from the gutter, never in the gutter so they can see you round the bends."
Yeah but
And they often hoot you if you're doing it but that's the place
That is their fault if they hoot.
Erm especially going up that hill at Hockerill lights.
They overtake you  and then they slow right down so that you have to go oohooh and stop.
You can't cycle that slowly up a hill can you?
"They come in too quickly on, once they've passed you"
They don't they're in like that aren't they straight in front of you.
frightens me .
cycle underneath a car today .
Oh dear.
Michael  's got  helmet.
That's a good idea.
Yes  idiot wearing it though.
If everybody looks like him!
Oh well.
I mean it looks alright if you've got all the gear on  you know cycling shorts and top and everything
make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them
Yeah.
But if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that's done to the proper standard because some don't work apparently.
absolutely nothing.
Well that's what I thought it just seemed to say they were gonna have sort of cycle ways going through the green wedges along  where I cycle already.
Mm.
And that's no help at all is it.
we can't complain.
That should do quite well in trying to get the traffic away from the centre in Stortford anyway.
Well wonderfully cool.
They would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out
Mm.
from.
But yes it was wonderfully cool.
Mm.
And the produce was salmon ?
And the prod it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't.
But er and of course stuff was salted.
Venison
Venison of course.
you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through.
Now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison?
Oh oh oh n no really I can't say that.
Er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep.
But no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see.
But not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south.
Mm.
And that  and to their friends.
And there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village.
Mm.
Oh yes that was one thing.
I always remember that.
So where did the venison actually go to?
Well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now.
Mm.
To make money.
No no there was no money made of it.
It was just for their for their own use.
Mm.
And haunches of venison that was the best part in the  they would be sent away to themselves  the haunches.
But the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the.
"There you can see the staging, and that is where the er wagons came in along here."
More pictures of the roof timbers.
"Outside, that was some stabling I think there."
And er internal roof-work of the stabling.
Just er recessed there to avoid it getting damaged with things passing on the side.
And we're now now walking round the back and er sort of now pointing towards the  Arms.
And you'll notice the er er again the brickwork and the buttressing along there.
"Now having just walked away er up towards erm  er  crossing end, there's the ."
And that's the remains of the cattle dock here.
Er I'm afraid a lot of it had gone by that time.
That was to hang Mr  on.
Or Dr .
"In fact there're two of them, there and one there."
And that's erm  crossing house up there.
And you can see that's where the main tracks where and this is of course where we had er sort of sidings and er other things and er and the main yard.
"Erm odd pictures of the engine shed, taken from somebody's back garden I suppose now."
Er but you can see the er the the engine shed as it was.
Single road.
Accommodate er one locomotive only.
"They normally had here, er just the one erm locomotive  little O four four tank engine, Johnson."
Erm built before the turn of the century.
And and er they also had er normally a little O six O tank er which was er spent a lot of it's time at er a at  at the what is what is now  er Castle.
Er shunting there.
"As I say, that er train would nip off to Nottingham I think every Monday I think it was, and get vacuum cleaned out."
Er and then return.
"what I've never seen, there's the that's the er tank, water tank at the top."
"What I've never seen, is a photograph from the other end."
"If anybody can tell me what was at the other end, apart from a hole, then  not carefully, er I'd be very grateful."
I I guess there was probably a lean to or something like that.
"But er i just don't know, maybe erm a sand store."
"But as I say, I've never seen anything, and I've never been able to find anybody who can provide that answer for me."
"There is a coal truck, that was parked there, and they would load up coal er from there as as necessary."
Right.
Let's list the tasks of a receptionist.
"Shout now, go on,let let's go for it."
"Telephone, answering it"
"And  telephone, answer."
That's what you think they do.
"Er, you're right, erm I can't think of the right word er"
Re-route.
"Re-route, same thing as what you meant isn't it?"
"Diverts, if I wrote divert up here you might use it against me in later life."
"Erm er route, let's just call it route er to  correct   yeah?"
"Does that make sense, that's for the receptionist we don't expect her to fiddle with the rates for liability, capital or whatever do we?"
Anything else a receptionist does?
Okay?
"Okay, so it's erm  meet  public yeah?"
We need to
Right fair enough.
well I did do stat view in the first year but not very much
Yeah.
"No, no I"
how to use it.
"find stat view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes, once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm  well I'll show you how to do an S P S S data file and, and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it."
Erm so er  that shouldn't be too bad.
"So I don't know do you, do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er er"
Yeah.
"another pilot and, and see if erm"
Well I'll just do it in my flat I suppose
Yeah.
"Yeah fair enough if, if that's erm you know how you fancy starting."
And then if you
finish it off.
"any, any sort of, yeah, any sort of changes or anything erm  er  I don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can"
"I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you  if you want to get drunk  and you want to spend money  then that's fine  but once you step over  that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've   and I've just said nothing because  although you ain't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but"
and then
Yeah
.
there's been disaster tonight  ain't gonna put up with it!
So what he say?
Didn't say anything.
"I said you know, I think you've gotta sort yourself out Lee  and everybody went sort of quiet  but  Paul said  I've never had a rollocking!"
"I said well in all fairness Paul, you ain't actually  bloody got , I said I don't do it for the fun of it  I said and I don't like doing it  but I see, he just sort of"
Well that's silly comment  can't be doing him any good!
I said well the thing  is discipline.
If grandma went
If the transport
into the  she'd  sherry each.
Cor!
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back  Robin is gonna get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck  I shall get it in the neck  and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think
Well then what did he say?
"I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!"
I said but I shall be wrong  for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
"Well he must of had that amount  he must be contin , he must have alcohol in the body  continuously."
"Of course he has  he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night  not Monday night  but  again last night."
So he never gets over it does he?
And he went to bed half past  two.
And got up at four.
"Before then I should think, quarter to four."
I should think he looked like nothing on earth did he?
Yeah.
Well he's gonna kill his self isn't he?
That's right.
Yes .
Yes.
"So you're really, in a way, you're not much difference than where you started."
"I think Margaret's right, if, if we really want to get through the business we can and however busy we are, erm ."
"I wouldn't we wouldn't to  every time, but I mean it can be, it can be just a very brief report on what's happened, you know, if we want to get through."
"If we said, like, if we, every second month say or every third month, then we, we knew we were going to have a speaker, we could the time before we could then do the business more thoroughly and carefully so that the month of the speaker we could just go through it very quickly ."
.
"Alternatively to, alternative to, to speaker, can we get erm, you know, brief films about different countries and, political systems and so on."
Mm.
"Yes, yes we have the video too, we have, we have the erm the Amnesty video and we, there are, there are schools videos to."
"Do, do, do they do different videos for different countries?"
"Not, they're not, no, the one I've, the one the group has is, is a general one it's on Amnesty's work ."
"Oh, I see ."
"Yeah, yeah, there probably are ones on different countries."
"I'm not sure that Amnesty does produce on, on, one particular country."
"erm, we have."
other organisations that
"Yes they might, yes, mm."
Though even that's the sort of thing that on T V that er
We can video ourselves.
that's right.
"Mm,, mm."
Yeah.
"Yes, there are a lot, mm"
There's all these workshops Margaret.
"Yes, I, I, I have about twelve workshops."
.
On all kinds of things.
.
"On all kinds of things, yes."
I enjoyed that very much that last one.
What was that one?
"my Lord do, do we agree to that now or by tomorrow morning?"
well I would think if it could lodged during the course of the next ten days or so
"certainly, it'll be done by tomorrow morning"
"I'm, I'm, if there any question over it, the reason why I said ten days I'm already sitting in London for, until the end of next week and therefore if there were any question, it's obvious that it came before me, and that"
it'll be done by tomorrow morning
yes
thank you
"yes, yes, that can be prepared and erm a copy of that to doctor  and"
certainly
"doctor  if you don't agree with what it says, erm, you can obviously mention that to  and  er  er along speedily say in the course of this week, the matter can be mentioned in formal to me, erm one morning at ten o'clock next week I would of thought."
In terms of I need to appeal this one
"oh yes, leave to appeal, erm  it doesn't seem to me that this is an appropriate case for leave, or at least for me to grant leave, doctor"
All court rise
And don't put your greasy little hands  ha?
Oh hi Warren!
You alright Shel?
What are you doing here you cunt?
Don't call my boyfriend a cunt !
That's my dad you're talking about.
Jos.
Cor!
Look at that bum now!
You should relax
I think you're really
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
I think you're really sexy Warren!
"Too late, he's mine."
"Alright, too late, he's yours."
What are you going out with Warren?
I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they?
"Oh their own, yes"
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty  so
where you do it
so well where you gonna go for that?
Where else can you try?
Er well I was gonna ask for
"when he comes, gonna ask or ask"
At the college do you mean?
"They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area  and"
the chemist
Mm
he's an old fashioned type
Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean
He's bloody finished now
"Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than"
"to get it, I mean he's very obliging."
He lives over the shop still doesn't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character isn't he?
Mm
"But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think"
"a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out"
"Look in the pockets you great pi , oh"
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you
"Oh jesus, Maggots  I caught a few"
there might be a fiver in one of them
You've got no chance of that
Hey did you know this
Yes  oh god  Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
"I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they?"
"Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow  go on  I want to put those lupins in"
Oh nine.
Right.
"So,."
It's a million so one million
It's a
times minus one million.
Is?
million times
And what is the sign of it though?
Minus.
It's the same
Right.
So it's minus a million squared.
"So wh when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten"
Yeah.
this looks like Y equals minus X squared.
Mm.
"And this part of the graph, in there I mean that wouldn't start showing until we get beyond about say twentyish."
"At that point, it could be doing all sorts of weird things, and you'd think oh, I've got this wonderful graph and I plotted a lot of points close together, so I know my sketch was right, because it looked like this funny W thing or M or something"
Mm.
"erm it might well look like that for that very small piece of graph, but the overall picture you've lost completely by not going far enough so you, you want minus infinity to plus infinity."
"When you substitute infinity in, just think well if it was about a million, what could we ignore?"
"I mean, you could work all this out  right."
Ten X plus another ten X. Okay?
"And then minus a hundred and minus X squared, and put the millions and things in but don't need to."
"You've got it factorized like this, you could just, oh, that's about a million."
"It's about minus a million, so it's about minus a million squared."
And there'll be marks going for .
"It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful."
Mm.
"But you've lost the, the overall shape of it."
"Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient?"
With me so far?
Mm.
But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right?
No.
It is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought.
The objector cunningly doesn't vote.
We must have a hundred MPs voting for the closure.
All of it ah right okay.
So we need a hundred  present.
Which is where  on a Friday afternoon.
But if if everybody else around the country has been lobbying as hard we have there's a good chance.
After all there's three hundred and three hundred and however many was yes three hundred and sixty MPs who supported it.
Three hundred and twenty seven put their name to an easy end.
So out of those we should be able to manage a hundred surely.
The other thing is if we're successful with Atkins if he's behind the bill the MPs are unlikely to talk it out.
They'll accept it and put send it through on the nod if we can get his support.
So he's crucial.
Why is the Whip so important?
Because surely he's just enforcing the Minister's policy.
Erm yes.
But these people get together.
Right.
I mean it's not as if Robert Atkins  making all the decisions.
"Three hundred people say hang round the bar and say,conservation board I've had lots of letters, well so have I, we'll get get through them they might cause trouble."
That that's the plan.
Well go for democracy the decision being you know for the country being taken by three
Tories rather than
Well that's right yes rather than one.
Well they don't ask John Major of course.
. They can tell  John Major .
So why I'm I'm slightly puzzled as to why Robert Atkins is actually more important than John Selwyn Gummer?
I mean
Do you think that makes any difference?
I think it would really in a way  and yet the people in  know how you sing so the  whereas the  maybe wouldn't know.
Mhm.
"And you would  you would be more, you'd be more nervous in case they they thought, Well she's terrible isn't she?"
"But it would also be fresher for them, you know"
Oh yes.
folk folk that know you either w might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before .
"They have heard it before, mhm."
But I've never  well I've never really
You've never
sang in  anything other than the pantomime that
Mhm.
"int he village you know, except maybe at  at the  Social or something like that, said, Come on up and sing and then I forget my words and  that's me."
"Do you like to know where, for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then  ?"
I do really.
"Aha, I do really."
If somebody's would l if somebody wanted me to sing I really would like to know er because
Do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you
"Oh I have a wee store, yes, but you see you don't carry them, I don't carry them with me, if I carried them with me I could sing  I could, well that's it,"
"If you did it more often maybe,"
"I feel if, yes, you would remember them an awful lot easier."
Aha.
But er
"What, how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then, I mean were they just things that"
"Just taking  aye, just songs that I liked and  I just er take them off tapes and, and records, and I just write them down,"
Do you do that all the time?
"Are you always, when you're hearing something"
Mhm.
you're listening
Mhm.
"thinking, Oh I'd like to sing that ."
"And I'd like to, aye, and I just  write it down in a  if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line, you know."
"Everybody comes from miles around, all the kids come and the parents last year, was it last year?"
Yeah.
"it look just like a ski resort all the bright jackets and the woolly hats and it was lovely, I mean they made it into, into an absolute skating ring for driving on"
Couldn't get your car up .
"Which, every, every thing went sideways, but it was such fun"
Mm.
"and the sun was shining and everyone had got pla plastic bags, anything they could get to slide on you know"
Oh yeah.
"they were going down our front lawn then down the, then down then down the roadway, cos it's a dead end you see, so there's not much , not much traffic"
"oh I see, oh you're alright"
"It's not, it's not when you get to the end of it  then there might be a couple of ."
"Yeah if you, if you're coming up you daren't stop the driver and there's things hurtling at ya, there's kids on sledges coming at you at about fifteen miles an hour and you'll have to try and drive around them and"
I'll stick to the old  what they've got in California then.
"Oh yeah, erm, oh I'd rather have our climate I think."
"It get up over a hundred, people killed"
Oh it's horrible isn't it?
it's a high death rate some .
"Yeah, yeah."
"Funny actually they couldn't, when the rescue people came they couldn't see where the damage was because of the dust."
Really!
"Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news"
Oh .
"This dust, this dust  in California."
"I have heard, I have read about it ."
"This dust , and a, what's it a hundred and fifty cars all piled up on top of one another"
Oh shit.
"and there's a lot of people isn't it, and they don't know how many's dead because there's so much dust they can't see."
Oh how awful.
.
Oh that's awful.
So.
I wouldn't like it that dry.
So that's what words are about.
Now brr any anybody here like me from Yorkshire?
No you're from slightly further north.
You're from Yorkshire?
Sometime ago
"Sometime ago right so you may catch this, and you're from slightly further north than that I think?"
Right okay.
Anybody from the Liverpool area?
No no okay.
If I said to John and Joanne erm that I saw a boy running up the ginnel no you understand?
You do you do?
Yeah
I know what you said but I dunno what a ginnel is.
Okay a snicket
I don't know what a snicket is either
No
No
Yes
But I know what you're saying
"Alright yeah, okay you see the point that that it's it's words  what the heck's he talking"
No no I know exactly
"Oh you did, yeah it's it's er no but I mean in terms of the actual word you don't know what it is"
No
er it's it's about geography isn't it? er coming from different areas of the country.
Right let me just explain then just just for the sake of completeness.
"erm in the days when they had terraced houses back to back terraced houses erm well anywhere in the country I guess but but where I come from it was fine for the people who lived with their doors on the on the road but the people who lived at the other side of the block they couldn't get from the road so every so often down the down the terrace they had a little alley way  an entry I think you'd probably call it in Scotland, don't they?"
We  talking about this and I was saying about coming from construction I says I've says I've to go up the cut like
Oh the cut yeah
"Where I call the cut, and he's going the cut what cut that's the canal I says  up the cut between  the two the two buildings she said no that's the alley"
"That's the alley, yeah, or the ginnel or the snicket you know or in Liverpool they call it a jigger"
Or the cut
"Yeah so you see the point, if you're making a presentation and you use words like that based on where you come from the geography you know your regional variations then it's a bit it's a bit difficult for er effective communication isn't it?"
That's a   about a  innit  bloody hell!
Paying  they're paying
yeah so
Well you .
"so I er  he said er  no he said, it's not that he said  I don't like people to tell me  you've got to do overtime today, he said, I like to be asked!"
"I said well I'll be quite honest mate, there's two hundred people working in this factory  and I said, if you think that e all the charge hands and the supervisors have got to come down and roll up you lot to get the job done  I said you  turn round and you think if you was in business, whatever it is you like to do, if you're in business and you've got an order and that order's gotta be out by six o'clock tonight  and you've gotta grovel to your workers  otherwise you'd lose that order, I said what would you say?"
"Down the road mate, I'd get somebody who wants to do the job."
Yeah  that's right
I said and that's exactly how they are!
I said they aren't gonna put up with  like you!
"I said and that's why  cos Paul said to me, he said, I never hear you moan, I said look you won't hear me moan  because  it's not that I enjoy the job  I hate the job  I said I hate the work, and I find it hard work  but at the end of the day  on a Friday, I know that  six o'clock in the morning on a Friday  I can go up to the Nationwide Anglia, slip my card in there  and I know there's gonna be a couple of hundred of quid in there  with the"
Yeah.
"tax paid and everything, and I know it's gonna be in there  I said now that to me is worth a lot  I ain't gotta worry whether there's gonna be cheque from   out on my doormat in the morning  or if it's gonna bounce when I put it in  so I sa"
.
as far as I'm concerned
"whatever o overtime they sling at me, I'll do  not because I feel like doing it  but I need to do it  there's"
Yeah.
my wife and kid at home!
"So he said oh oh said his moan and groan  so he said well I spoke to Blue he said, he's off sick he said and he gets ninety pounds a week for being at home  I've been working here all week he said, for a hundred and forty  so I'm forty pound a week better off than him!"
Yes but he's sick!
I said he's not on holiday  he's sick!
Well forty pound a week's forty pound a week extra
Yeah.
innit?
That's
So I said
how much a month.
Yeah.
Yeah so I said to him
Yeah.
I said but what an attitude to take!
I said you're not working for forty pound a week
"Thank you, it's a verb, right, to do something, so it's the same spelling that can be used in different ways."
What about the next one
Goggles
Goggles
I wore my goggles in the swimming pool
"I wore my goggles in the swimming pool, good"
"Right, the next one"
"Erm, trigger"
Yes
A man pulled the trigger on his gun and shot him
yes absolutely
Luggage
Luggage
"Erm, I had to have my luggage checked at the airport"
"I had to have my luggage checked at the airport, you see what's happened to the end of that word, look at it  right, you've got age at the end because what rule is working there?"
Got a double G
Pardon?
Got a double g
"No have a look, you're only looking at the beginning of it  here try again"
It's got the E on the end
And what sort of E is that?
"Not the magic, magic E"
"Yes it's the magic E, isn't it, and what's it making that A say?"
"A as opposed to U isn't it, so it's really like lugg age so if you say it quickly together it becomes luggage, yeah, okay, the next one, oh sorry put it in a sentence"
Suggest
Suggest
"erm, I, I have to suggest that the erm the had er"
"mm, that's right, I had to suggest the captain's orders."
I suggested
"how, what would you put on the end of suggested?"
E D
"E D, even though when we say it, it sounds like"
"Er, Brian , is also a regional director for Belfast and the serving areas of Belfast as well, okay?"
"He has sole responsibility for Belfast, but he does have regional directors going to  but Brian tends to cover a general manager role and  with  with erm  Dick ma ,."
"No, not Dick , who's in er  Belfast?"
"Tom, Tom ."
Yeah.
"And er  himself, run the Belfast operation  across all the regions."
"But sometimes, because he doesn't have hundreds of depots I think he's not regional, but that's my own fault."
Brian  is the Northern Ireland region.
Well done.
"Do get a, er buy a map, spend some money to get one."
You may have in your depot  you may have in your depot a map which  have pinpointed the T N T depots.
"Does any, has anybody seen one yet?"
Yeah.
The big wa waterproof one which you can draw on?
Yes.
Yeah.
"They're, er, well they're not waterproof"
Well
but they're coated aren't they?
"Er, so you can wipe them clean if er, you use a special pen."
"But, what I'm saying is, if you, salesmen particularly get one, you'll need one to get round the country  your patch, but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country  for deli , for delivery, cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport café, you haven't got a clue where the towns are."
"I mean, you know, where's your credibility?"
And write down erm  it.
"I know north of border, nothing happens south of the border and like but, but we do deliver down here so  do, do give yourself a little practise of that."
Now  I'm going to ask you to do another little test for me.
"Simple questions, ten questions, alright?"
"Do you want ta , tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again?"
And there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage.
Name on the top of the list.
Now  how many people have not seen a list of the
carriage yet?
Er erm
"Manhom believes that, believes what basically?"
"They look, er round that line, two three five  two three six  and Face is saying  you're very right sir."
She is a very rare scholar
"describing Doll Collan here, a whore who is seen wandering around the stage most of the time,she is the most rare scholar and has gone mad with studying Brampton's works."
And here but name a word such in a Hebrew she falls in her fit and will discourse her learned genealogies as you would run mad too to  to hear her sir .
"Now, so, Face is trying to sort of put off Sir Epicure Manhom by saying, you know, this a mad woman who's done too much learning  nice little attack on women here by Johnson, who, who  is one of the biggest misogynists in the world, erm  a woman who's gone crazy with learning  and who knows nothing because er she's just a prostitute and therefore she's thick."
Okay?
That's the joke.
"But th again, the funny thing is, even funnier, is that  Manhom lusts after her, gets distracted from this idea of getting all this money and sa saying,how am I going to have conference with her, Lungs ?"
"Erm  and Face said,Oh!"
For a mad woman   acceptance of her .
Okay?
"So, Face promises to get an introduction  to this woman who Manhom fancies and erm  and Manhom, okay."
That is the background.
"Next time we see them  they, they have met and  and Face sends them off to have a private conference."
Okay?
"So you now have act four, scene five."
Enter Doll and th they're talking.
"Will you please try and act it out like we did the Twelfth Night  the bit with Mrs , and see whether you can revive your idea of why  Johnson, what is the nature of, of Johnson's comic art."
Okay.
But hear guffaws  within minutes.
Right.
Do you want me to divide you up?
"Are you,do you want  class ."
You ne need four in a group.
There's gonna be one over so somebody be the walking around peasant.
I don't mind  right now.
Just move my mike.
I think one of you lot's gonna have to go over and join these three over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go on.
No.
"It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that  I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate."
"Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with  shower of rain"
"Mm, mm."
you know the sun is nice
"That's right ,"
"and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down."
"that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain."
That's right.
.
Get away with that now.
Yeah.
"oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy"
"Yes, you have."
.
"Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad."
"Oh, you  ."
"Yeah, but, you're mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been upsetting ,"
Yes .
"erm, when you think about after all ."
"Yes, exactly."
Mm
.
"Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important."
You've got to try and enjoy life.
"My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can."
"I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one"
Yes.
.
He's got the right out .
Too true.
He's got the right out look.
That's fine
your using a name.
Oh no.
He's responsible.
No.
"Because within, within our, within our procedures and our quality systems, the word project engineer crops up quite a lot."
Project team
Yeah.
"But it's, it's not defined as er an M S two or an M S three."
"I mean take the example that Hugh is always using, is that if I wanted to knock a wall through, a hole through that wall and put a door in there with a link in it surely to goodness we"
Right.
don't need an M S two.
If that's
Mm.
"the case then can I suggest that we define within our quality systems, that project engineers will be M S twos or above, for check categories of zero or above, and that for jobs with a category of double zero"
Oh no.
they can't be beneath
"Very, making it very rigid."
Yes.
You see what our policy is M S two except b except by exception.
"For instance erm we would give certainly the better M S ones the smaller jobs to project manage, but that has to be very carefully thought about."
Project engineer.
Project engineer.
That's right.
What happens if everybody wants to
panel view this
Now I would imagine if we had suggested
In broad terms
I would imagine that if we'd suggested that project engineering duties would beco
Could be done at M S one
At M M S one and S T O
Thank you.
I don't know why they bother.
"There's a signal box, from which the other picture was taken."
No doubt a lamp and  store there.
"Er this taken from where the signal box used to be, and that's where the line out to  is over there."
"There's hardly a trace of it, whoops."
And there you see er  really that was the old erm remains of the platform going towards er .
That's all that's left.
And again that's the  er er platforms as it is now looking towards .
Oh and they sorry the other way round.
That's the other end of it.
"And the er house there,."
Quite a fair erm service on the Nottingham Lincoln line.
Erm there's a sort of typical timetable of the nineteen twenties.
". Now moving over to to , er what is  Castle now, used to be quite a nice er well the the actual building   Erm that building is still here, and the bulk of that er station building is still there, er but erm I'm afraid all the er the buildings this side have gone, erm and er a lot of this has a lot of this has gone."
Again you you've got er lamps erm and water columns and barrier here.
"In the background, erm a big goods shed which is still there."
I think er it won't be long before that goes I think.
"There you can see, early B R days, erm as it shows it's  Castle, it wasn't  Castle, it was just  in the old days."
Water tower here.
There was never a turntable at er at .
"Er but er rather nice er buildings here, and er canopies, which I say have been completely er removed."
And er the level crossing of the old A one used to be here.
"The goods shed at the back, and the train just coming in from Lincoln there."
And the old semaphore bracket signal there.
"Er in B R days, a lot of the er traffic between Nottingham and Lincoln and Derby, er was hauled by locomotives from Lincoln depot, and when the erm  Region took that over, they closed the  or the  er shed down and used erm er Lincoln  region locomotives."
"This is an old  express passenger four four O, director class."
Er in York station erm on a er Lincoln to Derby train.
"Erm very attractive er locos they were and extremely successful, they were the mainstay of er the er er  line, and er outperformed many of the Robinson four six Os er that were built subsequently."
"Erm very attractive building, and I think in fact ten years ago when I took that photograph."
Erm I don't think it's changed much.
coming back er along the line.
And that's how it was in earlier days.
And for one reason or another the subcontractor bowled up on site on the Saturday afternoon and decided to do it then.
And he set up his own system of work using wal er er lookouts etcetera using er walkie-talkie radios and
staff exposed themselves to danger by standing in the four-foot.
His staff?
his staff.
Yeah.
There was nobody else's staff around at the time.
"It's likely we will ban the contractor for three months from, at least three months, from doing the work"
Mm.
although h he took a very professional erm attitude in dealing with the inquiry afterwards.
And didn't hide behind erm didn't try to make any excuses.
He said that it had been done wrong.
"He's actually sacked his own foreman, the main contractor cos the main, the foreman turned up on site and this I think is one of the lessons to be learnt, is that foreman turned up on site and saw what was happening"
and didn't stop it.
Mm.
And so condoned what was going on.
Mm.
And it's the major contractor.
Er may as well tell you i it's
So possession had already been arranged?
For the night.
The April the ninth.
For the night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they did it.
Mm.
Yeah.
"That's the only reason we found out, is our supervisor turned up to take possession, and the contractor's guy said, there's no point, we've done it."
So.
we've actually found it.
Could have been an inquiry into a death.
"just started, aye."
ah swimming on Monday nights and  I'm doing training another three times a week
"I'd love to do th I'm really unfit, I mean like totally unfit."
Sitting here I've got a pot belly and no fucking muscles
"That's what Robert wants then, to do a bit of training and start like getting"
"I'm not like overly fat or anything, I'm the right weight for what I'm, for my height like but I've just got a pot belly"
"They've got a spare room in my mum's flat so  I just took it over and put a weights bench in and, what else, a rowing machine  and I started to do some weights"
I never knew you had all those.
Have you ?
I've had those for years.
Expensive!
"sort of like what happened is that Robert was sort of like, the three of us sort of chipped in and bought it between us and stuff like that you know, so that all three of us would get the benefit of it"
Yeah
"but er  I was the only one that ever  used it  and I used it about once or twice and then, like  like, I used it for about"
Hi there.

But we really need a candidate and there isn't anybody erm obvious who's in a position to do it unfortunately.
Fishergate this year?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes he does he lives in .
That's in Fishergate isn't it?
That's very true.
Must be an experienced person.
I don't know  cold candidate.
No.
Yeah the main difficulty is in is in the time period because it's it's quite likely that I mean I'd we'd been we'd been hoping that the target candidate could put in a reasonable amount of personal commitment to to the campaign.
"Other and if it wasn't for for me doing a course next year which would probably preclude me from doing that, I'd be quite interested."
But I haven't got I couldn't at this stage say I could do a tap next year.
Even the year afterwards may be not.
Well shall I ask Humphrey whether he's
Worth sounding him out.
Ask ask him if he'd like to do it.
We'll come back to you if we can't find somebody who's got more time I guess.
Okay that sort of covers I think what I need to know for for election stuff.
Because we've said we're gonna have a selection ballot.
Right.
Erm another thing I noted under any other business is green strategy document.
This Government one.
I mean this might not be a good time to chat about it.
I it's just that I remember on Monday morning hearing on the radio that it was being talked about that afternoon and of course immediately forgot to go and get a copy of the next day's Guardian and read about it and all the other
It's today's Guardian.
It's today's Guardian.
I've got it I've got it at home I can bring it in at the next meeting or whatever.
That would be good.
Or drop it into their office.
Possibly we could have later event if we'd read
Especially
"Okay, I think, I think that is, that is a point."
"Again, that came up this morning as well."
That
"Shakespeare's so central to our heritage i you learn him at O level, you learn him at A level, you get used to him."
"Erm  he's part of our language  and, and therefore, you know, to go on to Johnson it's very different."
"Like you say, it takes much more time to get into it."
But I think Johnson does make it harder for us.
There are no characters to get involved with  as the there are in  in Shakespeare.
We can't really imagine ourselves  you don't really have sympathy for any of the characters in the .
They're all  fairly sort of silly characters.
"Whereas in, in Twelfth Night or whatever, we might actually feel involved within the, the people in the play."
Certainly .
"Okay, well I'll leave all those up there."
"Erm  can you look at scene, act four, scene five in my edition."
Now I discovered this morning there is actually act four scene three in some people's editions.
Okay?
"Erm, so act fi act four, scene five."
"And the stage direction at the beginning of this, enter Doll in her bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom."
Has everybody got that scene?
Enter Doll in bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom.
Okay.
Can you divide yourself up into groups of four first of all please?
"I'll do it for you if you, you want?"
And leave a bit of space.
Right.
"For those who aren't totally sort of in control of the plot  and I probably should include myself as one of them, what's happening in this scene I want you to act out."
What's happening in this scene?
"Doll  is a prostitute, okay?"
First things first.
"Who is working with  Sottle  who's planning to be the alchemist, okay?"
So he's probably fiddled a lot of things  to get money from people.
"The alchemist is getting money, I'm sorry, for people who know this  inside out, but I'll just explain it."
Okay.
"Could I briefly go back to liquidated damages, because there's nothing in the procedure, I think, that says what happens when you send that form to the client, he says, I haven't a clue."
What do you think?
Cos that's exactly what's gonna happen.
Because I've seen
Oh dear.
that form before and they will not know what to put on it or what they
You may be l well be right there.
Maybe  to tell them what liquidated damages
They need leading by the hand gentlemen.
Can't we just put a clause
"We need, we need, no."
They don't.
Organize everyone by us.
Perhaps we should set the course up.
Course up and .
Eh?
Absolutely I like that.
Yeah.
No.
It's very frustrating because I've never never known a client who knew what his losses were.
We'll run a course for project managers.
"As Hugh, Hugh is indicating that th that we have got a degree of expertise and we should be offering that expertise to clients."
Well we can tell him how much we'd be charging them to .
No.
No.
No.
"What we've got to do is say, look, within the terms of the contract"
This is what .
this is what you have to do.
You have to make a genuine pre-estimate of your
losses
Well he got promoted didn't he  he's stable now that child though hasn't he?
"Until they start tre tra blurgh they start treatment straight away don't they, these days."
Oh he's only twelve and ended up as one of the  smallest birds
"But it said I heard that it said chemotherapy well what's that's erm drugs is it, no that's radiation isn't it?"
Makes your
Oh y
hair fall out
well you wouldn't give that to a little baby would they?
Well you'd have to.
I thought they washed the blood out  changed all the blood.
Blood type  and that's what that other woman died  girl died of didn't she they
I was saying to Trevor  it's it's not very nice but it's rather so much better than than than having a cot death isn't it?
If you see what I mean.
Mm.
"I can actually imagine the feeling of going to a cot and then finding no  no the child was dead, that's awful."
Done  there was a  our school dinners today  I went into this  give you four pounds back  I get twenty two pounds sixty  Have you got two tens in change of a twenty?
I haven't got  five pounds
Have you got two tens you want to change for a twenty Paul?
No sorry.
That's been quite good that cos you know  I had a hundred and ten pounds left
Mm.
I only took out the palace because I knew  I'd given I'd written a cheque for forty
You'd written out a cheque
"and I've only just started, still got two people outstanding so I've got that forty pound and I put that into the building society and use that forty pounds  for months see  so it kind of like saved it for me, I've managed, had to do without it"
Yeah.
and er
When have you got to pay all that.
What mu a a th agent says I only have to pay it off a day
How much is it?
What just write a cheque?
Yeah  and that way .
Well you won't be there on the day.
"Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams."
All right.
Did you watch that animated version that you recorded.
Yeah.
Does it give you the gist of the story?
"It,half an hour long."
Well I think it's longer than half an hour.
They probably should
an hour at the most.
Given you er  erm
The film is about hour and five minutes.
You can probably have a video of it as long  of another version.
Well it's does help to see different  versions because  you see that different people interpret the
Why do you
Mm?
"Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got  different ways of doing it."
When I was studying  I went to  Open Air Theatre  and  I saw  a version there  on Christopher  er what's his name  that chubby fellow with the glasses  Christopher Biggins that's it.
"He was playing Puck  and when I went to see the  Company  doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er  a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"They did it in a completely  slapstick farce way  you know th the men who were dressed up  women they  balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite  different."
How they
"Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of  of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would  would have a different way of doing it."
Okay.
There's a comedienne  erm  she apparently was born in Wales.
Mhm.
Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her.
Two Ton Tessie?
"She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from  quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had  might well have had a Welsh  nurse."
So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy.
Mm.
"She did it as she would have  thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that."
Mm.
And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet
All round erm it was great.
We had our presence.
It's a very effective direct piece of lobbying and at a time when a lot of people who obviously weren't Green Party supporters behind the campaign.
The cross party campaign for the for the bill which we've written.
So.
the only political party ever to have two pieces of legislation in the House of Commons without having any M Ps.
I'd just like to second that it was a good day and also to point out as the er man who made the postcards we shouldn't get too excited about this as a money making scheme.
Because most of that three pounds thirteen's probably been paid for out hundreds of sheets of cardboard.
So.
But considering considering we were we were
Didn't make a loss.
I held ten fifteen pounds for the privilege.
relation thing.
Every time I do a stall I I quake in my boots up until I do it and then I feel great when we're doing it and afterwards realize that it's been  productive and we we've had a good lot a good response from the public.
So there we go.
Helen do you want to tell us about the next stage?
Yes.
Seeing as we all filled in our postcards ages ago we can write some more letters this week.
Or tomorrow.
I can give you a list of people to to write to.
First of all there's Robert Atkins M P.
This is the man who erm replaced erm Mr Yeo
Oh yes.
with his trousers down.
"Now I think erm Ron  was a bit upset because he spent most of of Christmas sending  Christmas cards and saying, Please please let this bill go through don't give it any ."
"And he said, Oh alright then what's your wife like."
Erm however
No that's right.
Erm Tim erm you know having desi have design?resigned  he was followed by Robert Atkins MP for South Riddle.
Now Mr Atkins former job is as Minister in Northern Ireland so he's unlikely to know a lot about what was going on in the in the Commons at the end of last session which is a bit unfortunate.
He's been hiding under a under an agreement.
He should at least be a very effective man.
Erm a farmer bought a new tractor yesterday
"A farmer bought a new tractor yesterday, good, right can you read the next four out, er Trevor"
"Bother, winner, winter,dr driver"
That's okay
The river was very cold
"The river was very cold, right, can you do the next one four  Charlie"
"Never, number"
The blazer was very warm
"The blazer was very warm, right, yeah, erm"
"Erm, I have a, a warm jersey"
"I have a warm jersey, good"
"Remember, Jack,"
"helicopter, er the helicopter was very big"
"The helicopter was very big, good, so you've all had a chance to use one set."
"Can we have a look at the ones underneath, in the orange block and will you do the first one Heather?"
The bomber opens the gates to attract the driver
"Good and the next one, Charlie"
When spinning its web a spider makes a clever  pattern
Good
My brother does a paper round and delivers a hundred newspapers every morning
Good
A

Go on
"Ca camels in, in a desert"
"Yes without water, right, Edward"
In the  modern
Hold on
travelled by helicopter
"Excellent so you've already got percentages sorted out there, can we just look at the next block of words, and  hello, hello, right, no, yeah  well I, yes I  I think it all went great, unfortunately  erm, so I really can't really consider on, on that."
"But that details of that actually has a  but I don't think it's a total story okay so I'll, I'll put it all down on, on paper and then we'll take it from there, okay, thanks, bye ."
"You know Ben Lech?hill, red hill going down to ?"
"I was young and foolish at the time,"
Fifty miles an hour on a bike ?
"Very, very high gear on it, we used to go out a couple of us"
And er  we were passing this M
You've got this on tape remember?
Oh no!
"We went past this bloke in a Morris Minor,"
"a convertible, with a  eyes streaming, it was really hard to see, and  clocked his speed at fifty, and er the bloke behind me nearly got hit,because when I went past this bloke  I went"
all over the road.
No you didn't really though did you?
Ooh no.
"No, no you didn't."
No officer I didn't.
Distance okay?
Yeah.
And displacement.
"When they measure your speed, they're measuring your velocity really, they're measuring it in a particular direction, along that road."
Mm.
"Erm so  we'll call it distance, right?"
"But we're actually talking about displacement, just so that you feel more comfortable with it, cos there are other things coming up to make you feel less comfortable you see."
Okay.
So the police say you were doing forty miles an hour.
You say how do you know I was doing forty miles an hour?
"I wasn't driving for an hour, you weren't following me for either an hour or forty miles."
"They say, ah well, we followed you for a tenth of a mile, right, and it took you so long to cover that."
"And we, our little machine here has calculated it that that's forty miles an hour."
Yeah.
"Okay, so what did they do?"
"They had your hundred a hundredth of a mile say, let's say it's erm  let's say it was a tenth of a mile."
Nought point one miles.
And they divided that by erm  nought point O
Not really.
So long as we're talking about sort of half a mile away ma maximum or with other sort of proper travelling arrangements.
If it's half less than half a mile away then it's it's fine but if not it starts to becoming problematical.
The other thing about financing it.
So I haven't done the sums in my head.
How much is it actually to get a  place?
Well if it's six pounds for six people that's thirty six pounds a night isn't it?
For four nights
Plus three
Plus a bit.
So it's about forty quid a night and there's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.
It's four nights.
So that's  that sounds quite a lot to ask the political party
Oh I wouldn't ask them to pay
Yeah.
That would be too much.
But it's one way of distributing any money that the party wants to give to subsidize people so that everybody can benefit from it erm rather than means testing.
I'm happy as long as we we get the definite six people definite.
We I think you know we can do go into just four four people .
I I'm quite happy to come in on it.
I think I probably would like a single room though.
Are there two single rooms?
Two single and two double.
Yeah well on a first come first serve  basis a single room I'd come in on it .
Well strangely enough I think we'll have to have double rooms .
Well if if we do only get four people it's going to be more isn't it?
Yeah.
It's going to be ten pounds a night each
Yes erm.
roughly and you don't get breakfast thrown in.
No that's right.
I I would hope to be able to  party conference probably only  which would mean turning up either Friday night or Saturday morning.
"Get down, get down oh yeah, yeah."
I got through quite a few bits and pieces that was
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do
"Yeah, yeah"
Yes I know
Hello there
Good afternoon
how's the family?
Abnormal
"Yeah   At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and"
"I noticed the little girl with her, yes."
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today
Huh
"said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever  said I'm in a hurry  then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er"
Who you don't know from Adam
"A spaniel  which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T"
Off the lead like?
"Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide"
then he was watching him like this then he ran
Away from it or
"ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know"
"I said he  he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one"
"Spaniel , yeah."
"he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning  on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches"
Stitches
"so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know"
Mm
stop him getting dirt
keep going
in it or whatever
Yeah
And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress.
"Now I don't what Italy and those  Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn."
Mhm.
But  the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress.
"Yeah, I mean  now plays  of  Shakespeare and  they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing  well either First or Second World War  uniforms."
Yes.
It was very different then.
"Yeah, well it's just different  directors have different  things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or  they think that using a certain  well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will  will have more of an impact, you know will"
"One thing I was wondering about you know they  they talk about erm  in  Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the  the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used."
Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature
Yes.
"Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it."
Does that help with it?
I suppose
Pardon?
Well you should do.
And what about  I bought some  revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature
Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing  Romeo and Juliet.
So if you look in those you may find there's some help there.
Yeah.
"Come in, good morning."
"Hello, well what's your mum been doing to you this morning ?"
.
Well she's just after the
"Freeze her, freeze her tongue."
"having the flu, near a fortnight ago now, she's on these pills and she's  as bad as ever, and not sleeping again."
"She's finished them now, she"
She's finished those .
Let's have a look and see what you've one to your your poor old inside.
Dearie me.
Driving your mother up the wall?
"I I I think really they er  they forget that that there's a  quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not  and aren't all that easy  easily persuaded."
"But, having said that  there is  but there are, but there as well!"
"No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see  when you say they're not easily persuaded  that  are working class  that are voting Tory  and they're not easily persuaded they cha"
"Well they did, I"
just changed their mind!
Mm.
Well  having  seen a little bit  erm  was on the other day and I I mean I  I must admit I touch  shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
"A lot of what's erm  you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind."
Yeah.
I'm a loyal supporter!
Well that's it!
And that's it!
"But erm  you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same  a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't  either don't really care"
No!
"or  they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about"
Yeah.
every party!
Yeah.
And making sure I get the right one.
"But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch"
No.
they've already made their minds up  and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on  on basically the choice
On the spur of the mom on the spur
Well
"of the moment, on the day"
think well they've had long enough now we'll  we'll have a switch you know
"Or or the  they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph"
and they'll go and vote for him!
That's right.
"And I mean there's that been that much  publicity about Neil Kinnock  you know, or anti  Neil"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Cos  that really got up, up my back when the , I mean tho ain't a ba , bad bunch of old boys but  I normally go down  but they they clear and once we've done our work  before dinner break they all clear off  and I go down to the   and then I sort of walk back  more or less behind them  you know, to the  break like  and as I go past the club, I go and wash my hands, they go straight in, I go and wash my hands and I walk past the   and er  we should go to dinner at quarter to twelve  and I go past, it's one minute past quarter to twelve  so cos when we go in there you see  quarter past twelve  due to go back  I always give them two or three minutes  and I say that's it, that's , ah we was late coming in, I said no you weren't!"
"We was  I said look  I can read a bloody clock as well you can, I said I wa walking behind you down the , you went in the canteen and when I went past it was one minute past quarter to!"
"So I said you know, the  one minute past quarter to  and there's a sort of quietly  you know  but then you know, just have to grab at"
Yeah.
they get excitement out of taking two extra minutes
"Give them an, inch and they want a yard"
I think oh my God!
"You know, I, it's so petty that!"
"That's like Sarah  at work, I mean  she leaves at twenty past five, if she thinks that, she'll leave at ten past five  I mean she thinks you're stupid because she don't always go  but even when she's not going  she"
Yeah.
still goes at twenty past five  so why don't she go at six when we do?
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
And she said she even
taking her home Sarah!
I told her I wouldn't.
"Yeah  cos she used to get me t , and then she rang me up one day when I was  and said  dad erm  dad can't bring me round there cos the car's not working, can you come and pick me up?"
Yeah  .
"She said I'll give you some petrol money, I said I'm not bothered about petrol money, I said it's the fact that I've gotta come round to pick you up, I said I'm not a taxi!"
Yeah.
"And then  I was late, when I got round there I thought well she'll at least be waiting at the top of the drive, if not at the top of the road."
Yeah.
"She weren't there, I had to go round the house knocking on her door and oh"
Yeah.
I was mad!
Yeah.
Well yeah you don't mind giving anybody a lift
No.
if they make their way to you.
"Yeah  and she used to be hammering on the door, twenty past five  you know  yeah"
"Yeah, seen that"
and then for   there's this thing  treating people who'd ruined this guy's marriage
Did you tape it?
Yeah.
"the apocalypse and all the people  atheists and   one where ah the Christians, Christians over there please   well I'm sorry to tell you but the jews were right"
Er do you remember the one where ?
"No, he'd gone up to the traffic lights and this cyclist sort of like cycled up, jumped off his bike and wheeled it round the corner so he"
"Yeah, he jumps out"
I like the one  car park
Yeah he got trapped in a car park and he couldn't get out for ages and ages and then as he got out he crashed into another car.
"Ah that's, that's it there."
Well did you see the one where he's getting changed
What's that?
he was getting changed in the car and he put a brick on the pedal and all
"Yes, yes he was going to work and he put the brick on the pedal while he's  jumped in the back pulling on his trousers  and st st steering with"
And cleaning his teeth
steering with his foot.
He gets into the back seat and he's got his feet over the fr the front seat steering with his foot
"Ah that's the same one he's making a lunch or something in, in the park"
Yeah.
The bit where he's on the beach
he's just down to the beach
Yeah.
"and there's this guy sitting  sitting beside him, you know sunbathing and stuff, and er  he doesn't know what to do"
Oh the teacher told us this one.
"he sticks, he sticks the, the"
Trunks.
"the trunks on top of his trousers, unbuttons himself and pulls them down, and he gets, he's er really, really awkward the way he does it and all the rest of it and gets, he finally gets his trousers off, pulls up his er trunks and your man gets up, pulls off his towel, gets out his white stick and"
"Oh he, he went swimming one time and that was pretty good"
"I can't remember what that bit was, I think he just stood on top"
"Yes he crawled, crawled to the edge of the"
Oh that's right and then this wee kid got up and jumped off didn't he?
So  that's the next stage.
Go.
can I start by asking your name?
Well my name is er Mr Laurence  er o of the Treasurer of the  in Edinburgh area.
And erm what was your date of birth?
"My date of birth was the thirty first of the, of the seventh, O nine."
Which makes me now approximately seventy six years of age.
What can you remember from when you were young about sort of housing conditions and
"What I remember of the housing conditions when I was then residing in Motherwell, a mining er community."
And known that particular time as the steel town of Scotland.
Was erm the whole town taken up with these sort of two occupations?
"Yes, it was all mining and steelworks."
Was all .
"In fact the Ravenscraig, present Ravenscraig was built up on the first place from a steelworks known then as Corral Steelworks."
Mhm.
"And D L Steelworks and Lanarkshire Steelworks, these er steelworks, all amalgamated which is now known as the Ravenscraig Steelworks."
Mhm.
What erm what kind of education did you go to when you ?
"Well I, my education was in a small er the local school, School in Motherwell."
Mm.
"And they were only a s s a sort of infants and secondary school er there, and you ."
"There was no, all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to, had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate, that was the only certificate issued in those days."
A qualifying certificate.
Er how old were you when you left the school?
I was er four I left the school at fourteen years of age and I was down the pit the following day.
The following day?
Mm.
What do you remember about working in the pit?
Well the working in the pit and the first and the first time I went down the pit er the pit was er John Watson's number four colliery in Motherwell.
And er I went with my dad and got into the cage which takes you down to the pit bottom and er er er immediately the cage left the surface it just dropped like a stone and I myself was frightened that the bottom of the cage collapsed completely.
Because my stomach come up and met my heart
But they would never take 'em out for day
"No, I know."
"But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and I even today, you cannot buy love."
No.
"And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't even think about  there."
Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Don't think about what.
Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to.
She goes round
Goes round  weeks ago.
"Well, she won't go and stop."
Said she won't go and stop again.
Who's gonna stop then.
When we were all on about stopping
"I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits, she says, I'm not stopping."
Yeah.
"When you were on about that love, what pa was saying about, you know, like every night, that our kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're like, to get hold,I'm lying watching television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put the kids,you know."
"And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum told me,turned round and says to me, I don't want  any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she won't let me have pillow  and then I then I think if summat else  brought to light, I  kill her"
Yeah.
if she had come in
Yeah.
"and that, I know it's a filthy old thing, but it it's comfort ain't it."
Yeah.
"And when they start  let them have the pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get comfortable."
"I know it's a little bit trivial like, but it's just, it's still"
She has queer ways me mother.
"Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me mother out, so, no chance for you working her out, few years you've known her."
"No no, I I, I mean, she's always been alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not  not at all mother-in-law, she's not"
"Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's never been close."
"It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum."
"Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars."
I found this.
oh shit.
"said, he said, yeah, he said, it'll be ideal in here, he said, I can put, he said, put a full lock on door, and he said, I can come in here, he said,and so I thought, ah."
"Yeah but, there's not many people that you can"
"Sasha, behave."
I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent 'appy.
"Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in, you know,"
Rushing about
"There's that much, there's that many people out of work, there's and"
"you know, there's that many pressures on people."
"I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean, like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per cent happy at all,But like, er, like some people I can't  if you get upset, some people eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go into recluse, some get  and like Colin,"
"he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a raving sex mania, he"
"I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me  out of a bed."
"He takes all, takes all his"
Why didn't you stop
No I think every
I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults.
Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
"I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either they go in and make  share, but if they work all day."
"No, it's not er, it's so much  I mean, he's at work all day,and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down,"
Yeah.
and what happens.
"He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, can't abide"
That's right.
Summat wrong somewhere.
Now look at our Margaret and Peter.
"They've got no family, so they've got no pressures like that, they haven't got any money problems  well they're not 'appy."
They live two entirely separate lives.
"Yeah, I know."
There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
Convenience.
Innit it.
"Yeah, it's convenient"
"Come on, there are rude words in there."
I mean
I grinned at farts.
Good!
Okay.
"Brunt, and a bit of a  at the moment."
Erm
"I mean Shakespeare did not, correct me if I'm wrong, use words like fart and, certainly doesn't use words like fuel gauge, have a leg over things like that, and things like, okay?"
So it's rude language.
Which is funny.
"I mean, we are all er very sympathetic at the end of the twentieth century, but, you know, we can still laugh when somebody says fart on stage."
Erm  there are other examples of that.
"You'll be glad to know that  in line four and five,What to do?"
"Lick figs out of my   he's actually saying lick piles  from my  and, you know the audience replies  fig  fig ."
"And the actor could, you know, draw attention the part of the anatomy he's talking about."
"I mean, this is not"
"this is not his sense of humour but it is visual, it involves the audience."
"Like, if you break off a line like, lick figs out of my  something, you're getting the audience going because the audience is supplying the  rude bits."
Okay?
Any other  things that were a problem about that clip?
Okay.
Forget that funniness.
Why is it different from Shakespeare?
What's the difference between that opening scene  and say the opening scene  in Twelfth Night or Winter's Tale?
Were they di different?
There's no asides  view.
Right.
That's another problem actually I hadn't thought of that.
"It's all  but everybody's  erm  everybody's involved from the word go, so  and the structure the  so think about that point."
"No, are no asides."
"Erm  I suppose there are later on in the play er th characters speak to each other and say very good that stupid berk over there kind of aside, but  what you don't get is  any structures of characters  as such."
You never get told what different characters are like  in th er by somebody else.
And that's looking up towards  up there.
"But the house is in quite good order, it has been extended."
"And that's er from the front view, I didn't go wandering in."
But that was the entrance to the station originally.
"Er  I don't know whether that's listed or not, but er I'm surprised it's still there frankly."
"So as I say, very very very er prominent building."
There's a little weighbridge or or office.
Er in somebody's garden.
And er you can just walk down either side of it.
Er onto the trail.
That's one of the see the old railway building there.
Erm looking up er the er line or that is looking from the bridge erm that's going down towards er th the just it it it er cur curved round to to meet the er the line er an and the s and the station was was here.
Just along the road.
Er that was erm  station just along here.
And that's a line from  between quite er steep er in quite a steep cutting.
"Looking towards  again from the bridge over the main road, er as one gets er near near ."
"Now moving on a little bit further, I know the talk said that I was only going up to er to , but I'm just going a little bit further."
We've cut across the er A six one four here.
Erm at the white post.
"Er and er  the line came from  over here, and on that embankment there was a bridge here, er but they farmer has er removed that embankment, but has still left this part."
And there's some still some one or two rather nice little bridges.
"Er still extant, and er now I rather like the architecture."
Erm and so I wandered up there and had a look at it and photographed.
"Interesting four four arch bricks, and er and and very nice stonework."
"And the copings there, the retaining walls."
"You can see the brickwork there, Nicely done and er very attractive for again for modelling purposes."
"Going a little bit further, I'm only er just a couple here."
"That's up erm near Not a very good picture that, erm but a er L M S eight er eight F, up near  that is."
On a er coal train going towards er towards .
And that's a an L M S crab also at .
"Again on a on a special, going towards Skegness probably, at a guess."
Now what's going the other way?
But it
Or was that last year what seven or eight of us wasn't it?
At St Michael's?
The church.
Yeah.
That was last year or was that two years ago?
Er
There was something at St Michael's but I didn't know it was the one world week.
Yeah I have never been involved in a  one world week event at St Michael's.
I thought there was one there .
You certainly were there.
In the church
No I don't I don't think
Yeah.
Anyway I mean hopefully this this will be sort of you know if it's well publicized it it will be well attended because of the past.
I think we might as well get in a few things and anyway I want some envelope re-use labels .
I've run out completely.
There you are  so many packets already.
Well if you don't want Traidcraft's re-use labels I don't care!
Oh!
I didn't know you did them!
Well erm
Doesn't matter does it
"well apart from this leaflet on recycling facilities, what else shall we have?"
On the stall.
Well who's gonna do the leaflet?
I will.
I think we ought to sort that out
"Well that will be, I personally think that's the only thing we can do."
"And we should just sort of say what is necessary to find out and everybody gets a few telephone numbers or telephone calls  check out addresses  find out about new ones, get in contact with the district council erm what is in the pipeline."
Find out about Uttlesford possibly why there's is running and whether that is going to br breakdown.
"Erm and if we then find money for printing it I would approach Barclays Bank, banks, local banks  and would it do it very modestly the same local the same style er and only hand it out to  places where people are likely to pick it up."
"There was not the money, we were forced to."
As I say the present day er premier just now is actually trying to do the same thing as a repeat performance
"So sort of erm what was, was there erm any victimizations or anything like that, from the bosses when you went back to work?"
"Oh immediately there was a victimization in the pit,o the pit was out."
Mm.
It was er taken there .
"The grievance was taken to the union, the union just say er told the steward who belonged to that particular pit there, right, just call the men out, that's it."
S so erm did  presumably are quite strong like that then?
Oh oh yes oh yes it was one of the be it still is one of the best unions.
Still is one of the best  for sticking
mm.
Was there erm I've forgotten what I was going ask you.
Er mm were there erm many strikes at the time?
"Oh no, oh no, oh there were all v very few and far be there may have been local strikes but, such as one day er a grievance been put in and the men struck work just for it."
But immediately the  get a result.
"So all our lads are more or less, that was lightning strikes and finish off."
Mm.
One day and it was finished you know?
"Because that would  union, you see?"
Did you work in the pits for a long time?
I was five years in the pits.
Mhm.
"Er eh in er in Lanarkshire and Motherwell, and er at that time, being a young lad  no more between er f er fourteen and twenty, I realized then  that wasn't going to be a life for me."
So I then decided that I would join the army.
Now I joined the army.
"I served my time in both India, Palestine, Gibraltar, Egypt and these sort of places abroad and when I, I  nine months of my colour service to finish, which were a twelve year service,when war broke out in nineteen thirty nine."
I then went er across to France with the B E F. Was in France about nine months approximately when the big invasion started in Poland and through France.
I was taken prisoner of war at Saint Valerie for a few of my friends in from Edinburgh who were taken prisoner of war.
I was taken to a main camp called Lamstor camp in er Polish er German border.
"And er you, you know what happened then?"
I was back down hole again.
"For another five years work, so I served five years in Germany too as a, as a miner."
"And if one goes back er and think about that wages were probably no more than two pounds a week on average, at that time, the er share capital of the Rail Railway I think I'm right in saying, was four hundred and fifty million pounds at that time."
Quite a concern.
"They had hundreds of thousands of employees, of horses and er everything."
Er massive organization.
"And of course if you strip everything that's profitable out of it, like the erm er the railway air services went, erm the er  the er erm hotels, ferries, everything else you can think of, you're left with er with a runt that doesn't make money, and not surprisingly the government then closes it down."
Still I'm mustn't get too political must I.
Er but you know you can always close things if you want to.
"Erm you can fiddle the books, I know that very well."
Another picture  show the  here a little bit here.
"Erm some of the a adverts in er our sort of parish magazines and and so on, er fifty sixty seventy years ago, some of the names,still there."
"Motor Company, well that used er that erm er that's the er ."
"Er  's, well they were well known, very big shop in the town they had."
Erm where Lloyd's is isn't it.
Now then Samuel .
"Some of  's wagons, delivering coal to Mr  's house, well no it was erm  's Manor, it was before Mr  came there."
"Er but erm that was er the Baron's house of course at one time in the eighteen, early eighteen hundreds."
Now a snow scene.
"Samuel , this was taken from an advertisement in one of the magazines, and one sometimes got a little bit of er of exaggeration."
"Er not quite certain how many he had, he had at least one wagon I know that."
"Erm very common, you know s seventy three, twenty five, eighteen, erm they very often started at sort of seventy three or something like that."
To give the impression  before.
Erm I say I don't know how many he did have.
Erm er but that er is a model of one that I made.
Er and er I I think it's a fairly accurate representation.
"Erm that is er four millimetres to the foot, erm so not very big."
But that's on to scale there.
I I work to a pretty  scale on these things.
eighteen point eight three millimetres between the tracks.
"'s  and all the rest of it, and er pictured just by the er er just by the station master's house."
I'll stop in about five minutes if that's alright.
Fine.
"Erm again,L M S yard there, residents  ."
"Oh yeah, Jean told me"
"she said no , Jean said oh I can't walk that, have a bloody heart attack she says, so they put her in a trolley"
"they put her in a bloody trolley and oh course she said, this woman said erm"
said she might be small she said but she ain't half put on some weight you know
Oh yeah
you know?
Yeah
"So I said well I don't, I don't look at her and I sort of see"
she said yeah she said sorted that out and put her in a trolley
Yeah but she had to walk back that way didn't she?
Did she?
"Yeah she went to, she went to the shops and got one of those trolleys, she said what for?"
"She said I want to go to Minehead now, what she said it's only just up there, yeah I know but I've, I've bloody got to climb down there and bloody try and get back she says, er"
"well it's not that she, it was affecting the drink she had you know"
Oh I see
"she said the drink, the drinks are quite expensive down there"
"Yeah, I'm glad they took their, took their own"
"Yeah cos what, what they said like, their own, cos they run out of wine at the bar  and er, they went in the supermarket and got two bottles of wine and kept them on the table you see"
Oh
"so, they said"
what was it?
"The wine that have in the bog, is that a cheap wine?"
Yeah
"Well they ran it like that cos they said at the bar we can sell you a bottle of wine for seven pound fifty though, so he said you bugger off he said that, went down the supermarket and get our own like"
Oh
"and of course the bloke that were drinking that he kept, then they buy a"
bottle and erm they used to queue at the table that for the
you know
Oh yeah
used to just keep topping that you know
I thought they'd be more into spirits than wine
"Well there were spirits weren't there, vodka and all that, you know, no I suppose one or two drunk the old wine you know"
"Changes in job specifications, personnel changes."
Reinforced ones
Alright  changes in job spec
I  procedures were introduced.
Any others?
backlog
Okay.
"Yeah, erm"
By examining people's body language .
"We're not going to that one now, cos I haven't examined your body language I'm not really interested."
"Erm right, difficult one that it's like the body language after what?looking at  do some work."
Amazing
"Yes, thank you for that precise definition there."
"What was that, sorry?"
"Yeah you wanna see if they can do it or not you can tell if somebody, if you give somebody something to do  body language you can normally"
Yeah  sit at their desk .
"Now the thing about positives, when  identify you know somebody might have training."
Now be positive about it.
When they've been promoted to a high ranking job.
"Right, promotion."
"And if you've got somebody who's gonna be promoted or you think might be promoted in a couple years' time, or even yeah less than that, well what should you be doing?"
you ever heard a succession plan is?
"Er you probably don't do it  erm  you know er so brazenly probably the back of your mind but again key staff, you are key staff er yeah if you actually prepare somebody to take over your job when you're not there sort of thing."
So in a way it's a succession plan.
What other things might come out?
What do we do once a year?
Review.
What?
Review.
Review.
"Anything else, appraisals, yeah things like that?"
Anyone else .
"historically with  what's happened is, the  design from Japan was taken under licence"
Yeah.
and they were based around  and and  designs.
Yeah.
"Now on the five fifty series for example, it's an  complete cartridge spindle on the twelve thousand revs, yeah?"
And we get you know so Anthony  would get that business.
Because complete spindles come under the precision range of products .
Yeah.
This is something I was trying to get clarified but I don't care really as long as somebody gets it.
Erm  but what happened then is er  tended to get the main bearing supply for the normal spindles that  manufactured and built.
Mm.
"And that was a set of three angular contact ball bearings, and then a N N thirty double row roller at the rear."
"Er we're now doing this partnership which was what today was about, about the new generation spindle."
Yeah.
"Erm so that's going great, I think that's really going well so the new design, I think we're well in on."
"Erm the old on that you know, took me two years to get the bearings approved and er you know but then having to wait a year and a half cos  had a year and a half's worth of orders on 'em and promised to hold the price for three years is that's what it took for them to use them up, er has run out, new orders have been put on  but I've got the chance of taking the business."
"Er but erm obviously with the  thing again, I wanted er obviously"
What was the
"you don't to go to 'em for  and they say, well you just took the bloody off me, I want a cut in me ."
Yeah.
This is this is
You know I don't want to be seen to be
This is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not knowingly take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
No at a price below  the existing suppliers ninety four prices.
Now when erm you say  are supplying at the moment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
"The problem is Dave , the buyer at , is worse than Ken   ."
He's a real dipstick.
Yeah?
W his last comment.
"Wh what happened is, Richard  was the team section leader, Dave  historically looks after the bearings sales."
South Africans.
Now controversial stuff here in the Sporting Life David Ashforth.
Now Jerry Bailey the man who rode Ah Kong This is at a press conference after the Breeders' Cup.
Jerry Bailey typically articulate was being asked about his success on Ah Kong He described how he had moved alongside a European ridden horse.
He didn't know which one it was he just knew it wa was a European rider.
How did he know that?
The Americans all sniggered.
Bailey smirked a bit.
Well he replied he was kind of flopping about.
And everyone laughed.
Well all the Americans did.
We didn't.
That was Walter Swinburne he was talking about.
"And Bailey's comments are backed up by the trainer Derek Meredith who says American jockeys are better, they ride closer to the horse they're neater and they are stronger too."
There was a warm hum of approval from the American hacks.
"You were there John, what did you think of all that ?"
I wasn't part of the warm hum of approval
I don't suppose so.
and Mr Meredith was a failed jockey in England.
He ended up riding a few jumpers in France so its erm although he's a good trainer now I don't think he's an authority and it's poppycock er frankly.
But when  appear over here they're a great success.
Is there anything in it?
Oh of course they're of course they are a great success.
They are top class jockeys.
But our top class jockeys in America do not flop about they use a slightly different style.
Admittedly they're a little bit less streamlined but if you're going to say that that makes a serious difference
but what's the difference in the courses
as well over here that our our guys have to cope with.
true
The tracks in America okay we go over there and we say they're tight they're quite difficult to ride.
"There's nothing like an Epsom, there's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with"
Yes.
Nowadays I mean I know there never used to be apprenticeships for women but

"Or, the trainees in our department would be female anyway."
Mhm.
"And the way the management work in here,I can say is they,aim they're promoting anybody to a chargehand they usually promote somebody that's actually no threat to themselves."
"There's a kind of yes man, that, that's the way the carpet industry works in general."
Mhm.
They don't promote somebody that's gonna shimmy past them up the corporate ladder although  you couldn't
say this place
"is a, a giant corporation ."
Mhm.
Aha.
"But sometimes I, I do feel that the girls, I, I know a couple of people in other departments that you could say would do the job equally well as the man they've put in, they probably"
Aha.
have bu be a better grounding.
Aha.
Yes.
"But I saw that in the glazier and  when I worked in there, they would bring people in."
Mhm.
Oh
M
they wouldn't promote?
"No, er, if you had a degree,"
Aha.
"and you absolutely no knew nothing about producing plain bearings you were sitting in the chair and probably a guy that worked his way through the factory floor who knew the job inside out, he was still"
a deputy.
Aha.
but because er you maybe had a degree well you get in there and you have to start

"Then John,, said well didn't you ask her this morning then!"
And Joan says oh no I forgot!
"Well   and even that didn't jog his memory, that he should have asked her to judge it!"
What a dozy !
You know
Who's judging it then?
"Well Mary  going to judge it and, would he let her do it on her own, no  he followed her round, making comments here, making comments there, trying to influence her  fact is, this'll make you laugh, you know the wall displays  you know th erm the books, Where's Wally   Where's Wally  you have this  page, of really tiny little things and you have to find Wally, who's  a person, right?"
Yeah.
"In minute detail, hidden on the page is something, you remember how Simon had books like that"
Yeah.
"In where's Lisa, Where's Freddie, anyway it's Where's Wally, for that  he said er  I think I'll get a picture of somebody  and er course he   I said you gonna call it Where's Wally?"
He said no I'm wanna call it Where's the Wally!
"Milly said  cos we'd been talking about this all day and they, the children had been saying to John  you gonna have a picture of yourself in Where's the Wally thing?"
And erm  Milly said ha can't think of a more suitable candidate  and swept off !

Still get some wrong it don't matter anyway does it.
Football will be there for children won't it?

Contract variation orders.

"Erm but obviously there's er a, a need, the need to advise the project engineer, and the project manager, erm following the possession."
"Can I, can I raise a small point on that?"
That is
Mm.

Nothing to do with the heart at all.
"Anyway, Sod's Law you know."
that's politics.
But you did look you did look truly awful in that picture that appeared in the newspapers you looked as if
"Well my real real girlfriends wrote and said, Michael, you've got lovely legs."
But did you think you were going to die?
I mean was it
No no I didn't.
"I mean I must be honest, I did not feel that frightened erm it wasn't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize, you can become a heart attack bore."
Very easily.
"Everybody who's had any sort of tremor or experience or much worse, they're all individual and it's no use me talking to you about my heart condition, because you haven't got my heart."
"Erm e e they're all individual and mine I think, looking back, was erm erm er a light er experience and I mean as I've said, the  the erm er w this telescope they shove up you, er I mean, Chris Patton had the same thing."
Erm is local anaesthetic in the groin.
"Up goes the telescope, you're lying there you know, and the doctor told me, he said, Do you wanna watch?"
Do you wanna watch?
"And I said, Ah."
You know.
Anything but.
Absolutely.
But erm anyway that's it's all it's all now a few a few months ago.
"Did it change your perspective on anything, on life, on politics, on what you're doing in in in the job?"
"Well I suppose erm well I  I I I mean I remember er ludicrous really, sort of thinking of what I would say at the Tory party conference while I was lying in  that hospital in Venice."
And I actually made some notes .
"Maybe just locally, at local garages but as far as, far as being the all national or anything like that, there was never  anything I  with the tramcars."
"Were the erm the relations with the bosses and the workers quite good, on the ?"
"Very good, very good."
Oh.
"Even with the inspectors too, there was always a good er  going with the, the people in those days."
Mhm.
And was this quite a well paid job?
"Well it erm it was average, it was average."
Yes.
And er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that?
Oh yes.
Ex exactly the same as  going to the present day.
You had the split shifts and the down shifts and maybe we were called for er a
"What did you do after you left, you left the trams?"
After I left the trams then er I went er I went away to East Kilbride.
I used to work for a certain er c er creamery there.
Er
"getting milk, separating milk er pasteurizing milk and  like that."
Was East Kilbride one of the erm one of the new towns?
"it was er now it was, now at the start of the new town er present East Kilbride a new town, it was known as a new town and it was just starting to build up."
And I had better chances of getting a proper house for myself and my family which was then two daughters and my wife and I.
So we actually went there to better ourselves and try and get a h a reasonable house to sort of live in and
Was there a lot of encouragement given to people to move out  premises?
"Oh yes, at that time there was, yes."
Oh yes.
If they accepted it of course.
"Was it er easy finding a job at that time as well, in the, in the new towns?"
Oh yes.
"It was being that the, the Rolls Royce  Saturday, came in to East Kilbride and, and American firms like that were coming along."
Singer sewing machines and sort of things like that.
"They were all coming into East Kilbride, there was b cos after all there was starting off a new town and they was building up then from it."
What were the erm conditions like in the creamery where you worked?
"You could substitute it, perhaps for that one."
"Yeah, okay, okay well look,"
Have a think about it
"yeah, okay."
"if, if you want to do a version of it first, I think we, we, we'll appreciate it very much."
"Okay, fine, okay yes."
"in order to get, because I hesitate to give you more work to do, you got enough work."
fine.
"But, think about it, it could be interesting."
"Yeah, okay, sure, fine."
We'll have words about it.
Thank you.
come on in.
"Now, I have some good news for you, and you could do with some good news, couldn't you?"
Yes.
"Least, I hope it's good news, from what you said last night, I think it would be good news."
"I have got you a computer, one of these  would you like one of those?"
I'd love one of those.
"Right, we can get you one."
I'll tell you what's happened.
"The thing is, the school has just launched a, a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students, okay?"
"Now, we've got one in this department, like this, and er, one of our graduate students was very interested in it, and since she was just finishing her P H D   the in some of the ways, some of the most erm, outspoken erm, persons for this, but I'm certainly not alone."
"There's a growing body now, of people who are thinking along similar lines, and er, so it's, it, it's, I think you'd be unwise to wipe this off just, just as my eccen eccentricity."
"I mean, it may be that."
"Look, we're gonna have to stop."
"we can carry on with this next week, as, as you see, we've touched on a big topic, so we'll, we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion, whatever way you think fit, erm, that raises other issues which you want to talk about."
Okay.
Thanks very much.
And well done  that was an excellent
a little contradictory.
"Erm, I read another erm, book on believing this."
"Yeah, fine."
I
"no I can't, no not there"
Let's have it then
"No, no you can't love, because"
We've done it at work
"Go on then  that is the same thickness as that in there, that is"
What's that there then?
"That's what that, that's come off there that has"
Well you pull it out don't you?
"Go on then you try and pull it out of us, that's what I'm trying to do look"
you want a pair of pliers do you?
"Have then, it's harder than what you think it is this"
Ah?
It's harder than what you think it is this
"Oh, I wonder why this was"
yeah
"I suppose that's why it went, sucking it up properly  I suppose she had it riding up"
had a tug at it and that's what rips it I suppose
Yeah
I'll get you a pair of pliers?
"You can get, you can get, you can get whatever you like darling, but you won't get that in there pliers, you won't get that in there, what I'll try and do is get a"
"What about cut through, what do you reckon?"
Well
"With that, let's have a go"
Want a cup of tea?
I suppose you've been whistling today
No
"Well we'll have to do upstairs, hoover that much longer"
Why's that then?
Oh cos when I've been doing it
"has been up there nattering, it's been noticed, so Norren come up to me today and she said oh er you don't have to do upstairs she said, give it a couple of weeks she said and you won't have to do it any more"
Why's that then?
But you can't back out of the whole rehearsal
"I mean I've backed out of going, having, I'm supposed to be working on that on the stalls as well but I backed out of that and said I've got a hair cut, erm, so I'll have to be done last."
"It's not, it's not gonna go on very long is it?"
"Yes, er probably until about half four"
"Well that's alright, she ain't she's not here till half three in any case"
"Yeah, you'll have to come home a bit er, a bit er"
Yes I know
She's  so this'll probably be our last appointment here wouldn't it?
"No I was saying to her  I'd probably have one more before I go anyway and er  I'm, I'm gonna ask her if she  with my, cos at that nana's there, I mean there'll be four of us there, it might be worth an hour and a quarter drive"
What her?
She wouldn't wanna drive an hour and a quarter
"Well she might not, she might do"
"She wouldn't drive an hour and a quarter, it's not worth it"
"Well we haven't much choice, we'll have to arrange something else that's all, mm I don't, I don't wanna give her up, she's a good hairdresser"
Well you can hardly ask her to drive round and er an hour and a half
An hour and a quarter
for twenty quid
"It's not twenty quid, if Melanie and I have our hair permed, that's, that's two perms and two, two cuts"
And granny have it done
Possibly
dad can have it done
Possibly
nice family outing
Er if she was to come over
Saturday
"No, no, no"
she won't do that
"but she could, I dunno perhaps we can work something out, I dunno, er failing that we'd have to come out to her house"
"Oh right, yeah, I'd rather go up the road, stupid"
"I know, but she's really good though, I be shall sorry to erm, have to give her up"
"oh dear, see that tutor tomorrow morning for an hour, hey hey"
"What, get the job er copied up then"
You've got six month's free membership don't worry about it.
Yeah I wasn't worrying about the six month's free membership.
But it does put in rather six months out of phase with the local membership so at least
Well John sorted that he's brought you up to date now.
Mm.
Because you know it's the same thing.
I was gonna give the er local party er  it'll be sixteen months  worth local membership
If you want to give us a donation that's entirely welcome.
Perfectly acceptable.
I'll buy some .
I've already bought some
yeah.
bought some  more er
So what Joe wanted the meeting to decide is should we ask Mark to send off a cheque for those three people?
I think that's the only way to proceed to to sort out this tangle once and for all.
Yeah.
You see apart from anything else if those people  joined through us then we we must make good .
And we fixed it.
The system's fixed so.
Yeah.
It it has to be fixed by either us or the national party.
We can't ask those people for money if they've already joined once.
Okay.
Erm I'll get Mark to send a cheque off when he gets back from .
Okay is that oh I suppose as as another officer I can er tell you that the the newsletter has indeed been finished and gone out.
Erm I would like to apologize on behalf of myself and my  proof reading team for the fact that two calls for nominations that erm that are in this newsletter don't actually appear to have closing dates on them.
Oh god.
Which is a bit of a stupendous cock-up from us
"At least on my part I'm, if I had my engineer's hat on I'd er blame the proof reading team as well."
But er I suppose really I er
Well you forgot to read it because you threw coffee over me.
I suppose the blame is at least almost entirely mine.
Let er let's hope it'll mm  won't be like that er mm this er this year.
Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas.
Do as I do have turkey instead.
I'm playing this one because I like it.
It's a little a little fresh Cajun music from New Orleans from the  and I can say that er that's why I'm playing it really.
O nine O four six four one six four one any calls about dogs or er any other sort of animal you want to give us a ring call us now.
which er er probably rude I dunno it's just .
Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour.
Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it?
Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it?
Could anybody bring us a bottle down here  you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York.
It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape.
Has anybody tasted it?
I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call.
I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that.
"Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area?"
No he doesn't know does he?
Er stuff it.
Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they?
Everybody's in there.
"Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room."
Tour buses around York.
Should they be banned?
Should we get rid of them?
Is York a big enough city to have them?
You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic.
I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round?
Why can't they walk round?
"I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier."
What do you think?
Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one.
You can ring now.
"Oh, brilliant."
So there should be something in there.
"I found something from the AIDS one the new Benetton advert, have you seen that?"
No.
Is it really sick?
Mm.
"Not really, it's a bit rude, I suppose."
"It's of erm,photo coloured photograph of, it's either a bloke or a woman, you can't tell, from there to about there, so you can see all the hair and everything it's got  on the skin H I V positive."
"Oh, I think I have seen it."
"Ah, that's terrible."
"They're just out to shock, aren't they?"
"Yeah, I think it's a good way, and, cos it makes people go, bloody hell."
"And then they take note of what the issue is, yeah."
"realize, don't they, yeah."
"So I've got all ready, for me AIDS  cos I used to just think oh I don't really, I could just go and get some leaflets on ban on"
True.
"Well, I must ad I'll probably end up going down there, and getting the"
Our local chemist at home.
"Yeah, they've, they've always got this good stand, haven't they?"
"All this stuff, loads of stuff down there about pregnancy, and measles."
"Yeah, so they reckoned it's not a scrapbook, but it is really."
"That's quite easy really, I'm quite happy doing that."
Quite like that idea.
"But erm, yeah, it's alright."
"I like this girl, cos she's Welsh, just, I can't do her accent, but she kept saying it several times, he was getting really pissed off with her."
He'd obviously taken time over building up this little booklet explaining the stuff.
She just destroyed it in one go.
Really?
"Like he, he was like saying, it's got to be a  the word book, will eventually  he was really getting into it and really going into about, you know, how it's really gonna be jam- packed with important information, and she just said,so it's just like a scrapbook really  you know, when if you've filled all that up"
Yeah.
and somebody said that.
"It's like, oh yeah, thanks."
"Give me a figure, that you might have seen in an advert, when you're drooling over BMWs and things, Maseratis."
Miles per hour.
Telling you about its acceleration.
What does it say?
Goes from nought to sixty.
Good.
In?
Six seconds.
Six seconds.
Nought to sixty in six seconds.
So those are the units of acceleration.
"From one speed to another speed,"
In however qu
"in so, so much time."
"So let let's say, instead of quoting from nought, they said well a much more useful figure is perhaps, which they do quote in lots of these car magazines, is erm forty to sixty"
Mm.
because that's what you need for overtaking someone.
"You can go from forty to sixty in point three seconds or something, you can really shoot past anything on the road."
"So forty to sixty, miles per hour, metres per second, whatever you like, let's say metres per second."
Let's say it goes from  forty to si forty metres per second to sixty metres per second in ten seconds.
"More of a slug, this car."
So what would that acceleration be?
How w what would the units of acceleration be?
Twenty metres per second per second.
"Twenty metres per second, per second."
Per second.
It's simpler to say per second per second .
"It's  Or per second squared, or second to the minus two."
"What is this rubbish, it doesn't, doesn't, cannot possibly mean anything real."
Mm.
"Well, it is real."
It's  erm fifty miles per hour  per hour.
Yeah.
"Right well we'd normally say, miles per hour per second."
"What's, what's your acceleration at the moment?"
Well it's ten miles per hour per second.
Okay?
"Well every second, I'm going"
I'm going ten miles an hour faster.
"So miles per hour per second, or you could measure it per hour if you wanted."
"Every hour, I'm going six hundred miles an hour faster"
So
so it's miles per hour per hour.
you'd need a stopwatch and a speedometer.
"You'd need a something to, I say, we've got something to measure the speed, radar gun,"
Mm.
"not interested in the distance, just the velocity, the speed."
How fast is that car going now?
"Okay, he's doing forty miles an hour."
Measure him again in one second's time
He's doing sixty.
"he's doing sixty miles an hour, so his acceleration was twenty miles per hour per second."
Per second.
"Twenty miles per hour per second,miles per hour, what's the change this miles per hour into metres per second."
"Okay, so,say a hundred and twenty metres per second per second."
And that's where your per second per second comes in.
Are you a bit happier with that?
Yeah.
But not totally convinced.
No .
"Erm  that length per time per time, is the unit."
Let's just have a little look.
What are the units of displacement?
Er
"Yes, well course I."
The scenery and photography and everything suppose to be absolutely wonderful.
Yes that's worth it .
.
A lot of our modern hol
Hello Max.
"Modern   Come on, no she hasn't got anything for you,."
"Come on, come on, come on."
"You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say  come and try the mo modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments."
.
"Most of it comes  think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that"
Mm.
"and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks."
"That's right, there's certainly a ."
"That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic  and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?,"
I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally  birch bark.
"Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain"
"Oh yeah,."
"amputations, child birth  gosh the leaves are thick."
"Mm, they're lovely aren't they?"
When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones
Yes.
they remind me of when I was at school.
"Sycamore oh, sycamore and  ."
"used to get told to go out in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves ."
Actually I
"Could always , could always see if  biggest, biggest leaves like these you know,."
"That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour  These are  Dances with Wolves."
"Oh, it's  in shop."
If it's
.
"If it's good, erm, can I say truthful background of the Indians ."
Also on the A one in the Leeming area the inside lane of the south bound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there.
In Selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result.
Also in York today traffic near to the Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place there.
In the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the  Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge delays are likely as a result.
At Stockton on Forest Stockton main bridge over the A sixty four is closed for resurfacing work through to six o'clock on Monday morning.
And finally in the Thirsk area there are no further reports of snow on the high ground there but some moorland routes may still be a little slippery.

Stay at home in front of the fire and listen to Radio York.
Ha ha.
Oh that was slick.
Okay now er Garth Brookes my favourite country singer at the moment and er your chance to win this Elvis video okay you have to ring in we're giving this away first you have to ring in and tell me and tell me the next word no I can't do that I can't no I can't do it's too easy okay.
All right tell me er complete the sentence of this of this particular hit song that Elvis er had and it's difficult all right.
There were three words in the don't ring yet there were three words in the title I'll give you two you have got to give me the last one.
It is difficult it is difficult I know all right?
O nine O four six four one six four one this is it.
exac stop this casual labour business you see?
"Whe whereas the building trade would say oh I'll take you, you're a friend of mine, I'll take you you're a friend of  I can take you, you're a friend ."
"It was  It was  a great lot down in Leith here, and I've often seen it down in Leith docks."
"When I've been down there trying to get casual work, you know in Leith docks?"
"And he just down, they're all in a big crowd ."
"And a chap come out the offices and say right, you you you ."
So in actual fact it was always a favour cos I got the jobs.
"So to stop all that, this is with the b building trade, they had to guarantee them."
So presumably that was quite a popular piece of er legislation?
"Legislation, oh definitely."
Mhm.
"I've had s still operating now to present day, I don't know."
Mm.
What did you do erm after that?
Well as a  reach up up .
"In fact that's what I left from, I left from the job at job street in George street with the building trade."
That's when I .
And I  work after that.
"But the site  prepared to let me work, to carry on then as s they ma and I wouldn't claim my pension until I'd finished."
"And behind that, their reasoning for that is, for every year that I worked over my retir retireable age, there's a  that is added to my pension."
He says I  haven't got you working long  longer I worked the bigger the pension I have when I go out .
So were you allowed to work er after your retireable age?
"Not, not at that particu when they got to hear about it."
Mm.
"Of course they, they had questions of  and he says oh well I've sat with him, the man's prepared  working at Lambert, but no you can't allow the man to work after he's sixty and that was it."
So that was me on.
But the OAPs
Were you involved in any erm political parties or anything er ?
"No no not necessary though, though I have done quite a wee bit just now er in support of my Labour Party, you know?"
"Done quite a wee bit and I've been there at a few of their, quite a few of their meetings and erm a good friend of quite a few of the councils."
And Lothian  District Council.
Quite a good friend of them you know and I'm a close contact with them.
General essays can turn into just regurgitating from the .
Okay so is there anything you've read that you all would want to concentrate on?
Erm Well not that I've come across yet  I'd rather do something that's  getting the facts and then giving examples.
Mhm.
I want top do something on what what you noticed about  and what you've got
Right.
Right.
Er let me think.
"I'll just go and find out when the due date for this essay is, and then Cos if it is the end of week three then I'll I'll say o I'll say it can be in in week four sometime."
"But if it's due in when the project originally was which was week five, then that"
"gives you a bit more time to decide exactly what you want to talk about cos if  if it has go to be in week three or week four, then we really sort of like decide now what you're going to write about so that n Cos next week is gonna be our last meeting on this topic, so you really want to sort of give a bit of a presentation on what you're going to say."
Yeah I want everyone to do like five or ten minutes next week on what they're gonna write.
Okay I 'll just go and find out.
What are they supposed to be doing by the way?
What happens to the like project?
It got cancelled .
Cancelled
It got cancelled?
"Oh right, didn't hear that then."
"There  Oh that's why we're not doing it any more, so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay ?"
Just an essay.
"Oh, they decided not to give us quite so much work?"
Mm.
Oh right.
So we Is that why the
"Is that what we're meant to be doing this term,tutorials?"
Think so I don't
When do our tutorials stop?
I'm really confused.
We've got two more tutorials?
"What Oh yeah, week three and week four, and"
Yeah.
"today, somewhere  never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you  Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash"
Right I'm going to work in the workshop
"I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it."
You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it?
"Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two"
"Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?"
Or
No.
"Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?"
Let's turn that down
Can't turn it out.
Power isn't it?
"Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you?"
I don't know
Use your
Fantastic that
pause
"I'm looking for something somewhere   Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh  Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you  it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a"
No
See how she goes.
Erm
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them
"Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood."
Possibly have
stones
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the
"Oh  I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for"
enough
"Mm, and it"
the nails in the wood that's all
"Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?"
Eleven or twelve wasn't he?
It just cannot work every time.
Right.
"The on the, the, the, the procedures should be flexible er written in such a flexible way"
Yeah.
that those idiosyncrasies of the different sections can be accommodated.
Th they should reflect the best practice shouldn't they?
Yes.
"The best practice in, sometimes in M and E is, is quite different from the best practice in the"
Mm.
civils.
Right.
Le okay.
"We can talk genera generalities till the, the cows come home."
"I believe that, that that procedure could apply to you the same as it can to Roger and Terry"
Yeah.
and Dennis and Alan.
"Er and if, if y if there is a resource problem then you David and I need to address that"
Mm.
erm and find a solution.
"If when we address it we find that th the procedure is inappropriate, then we should change the procedure."
I agree with you .
Mm?
Yeah.
Okay?
"Er D two stop three, receipt of appointment contracts."
"Erm what we're trying to do here is to get the clerical sections more involved in the projects, and in passing the paper backwards and forwards."
"Er and we're identifying that the clerical sections are required to do a certain number of things when the project arrives, like erm recording the project in the index book, creating a correspondence file, creating project admin wallets, and the like."
So it's sort of er three things we're trying to do there.
"What, what was the reference of the urgent work one?"
"I, I've got that down as D two point three"
Was it three point two?
Mm.
I didn't have to say anything.
"I said to him  I don't know, he said  did you enjoy yourself Tuesday?"
"Oh I said, did you see us?"
Oh yeah we saw you.
And his dad's nice.
Yeah.
But that other bloke was there but he wasn't in his normal place.
Yes
Why wasn't he in his normal place?
Palace played really well.
"The first twenty five minutes, when you think we were one nil up right I thought gosh  if we could get that second goal it would have made all the difference and United would have been really would have been in trouble."
Was a good game though.
"Oh I enjoyed it, yeah."
"Just don't enjoy Palace losing, but   sheer football   and it just shows you that ironically the two games can match each other and there were chances for Palace to wrap that game up."
But er  when they do play that ball to ball  business erm
Yeah.
we look like we've got huge spaces in our  in our midfield.
"I mean  that's what teams are doing now, they're realizing that's where all our weakness is in midfield  so  don't take a er a hefty boot and try and er er  people like Thorn and  I mean Thorn and Young were impeccably  they played beautifully today."
"You cannot ask Thorn and Young, I've never seen two players play  they do, they did th , they do the simple thing  but they do it consistently well."
"Over and over again, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty times in one match and they'll make one mistake and usually like Coleman was there to c , I think Coleman backed up well and Gareth  backed up well once or twice."
But defence wise  superb.
"Absolutely su , there was a lapse with that guy, don't know who was to blame about that third goal but I mean"
It was Young.
Er Young let it plop over
"Oh, didn't see who it was."
"It was like, it was like a, like they were waiting for an offside or some there were just couldn't believe, it was"
But it was the same when Palace scored and exactly the same thing happened didn't it?
Why do they lapse?
It's weird.
"Yeah, it's  well they do say both sides that it's the most dangerous time straight after a goal."
"I mean often, times you see teams equalize immediately."
"You know it's like, you sometimes you can go a whole game like seventy minutes of a game and no-one's had a goal scoring chance"
So if we're going to do er  I'd better unclip this hadn't I?
Yo
Yes
not one
not once
not one but two
Oh that's awful
Oh dear
You'd thought that these houses could of least put a bit of paint on
Why?
Make it look more attractive
No
They look grotty like that
I still think that you should buy Jean a Range Rover
Why?
"She likes them, nice cars"
I'll buy her a dinky toy one
they're beautiful
"Mm, they might be beautiful but they're difficult to run"
What do you mean difficult to run?
They're a damn sight more efficient than this I'll tell you that for a start
Rubbish
"they take more petrol, but servicing-wise they don't require as much"
Rubbish  they're probably a lot more expensive to run than this
"Well just because this is a Jag H J six convertible, it's neither here nor there"
"Oh, what the whole part of the problem running is, is the depreciation thing, the more, the more you spend on a car the more the more depreciation you're going to get"
Oh I suppose so
I'm not saying I suppose it's better
well this is a classic car as they go
"It's a, it's a, it's a er"
Oh no
What?
because it will be very complex.
"If you want to, if you start building a system that's gonna record every variation that's issued to the client and"
Make it simple.
print it all back again.
M see if we can make it
Yeah.
fairly simple.
"Could I just say at this point, this, this is one area where I would envisage us looking critically at what we're doing and, and, and, and altering things quite significantly over the next six months."
Keep it simple and build up on it
Beca
if we need to rather
Yeah.
than go the other way.
"Mainly because we're doing, we're trying to read the client's mind at the moment."
And w we we're putting together what we think the client wants.
"What I'm looking for is feedback from the clients which say, yeah, these reports are alright as far as they go but really I don't want all that information or I want this information."
Or
"And I would hope that we, we we enter into that with th that spirit and"
Mm.
"we're prepared to look at the the client reports and change them so that they become as good as we, we can get them."
Yeah.
Is there anything within these
It is the first step.
for the prediction of fees?
I mean we've just
Yes.
got something back from Intercity  on the P S work where they're wa wishing us to predict to certain date what we're gonna be spending over the next six months.
Nine months.
the football ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well
Metal Mickey.
really
Metal Mickey.
Well that's
really a bright spark.
You know.
Yeah.
What I'm
But erm
"what I suggest is these procedures are, we briefly mentioned this this morning, are supposed to reflect the best practice of what we do now."
Yeah.
That is not what we do now.
"That is actually saying to the Q S, you've now got authority to come in to B E S and effectively do what you do on the civil side."
And what I'm saying is he's certainly not geared up to undertake that task.
And that certainly hasn't
Jim?
been debated.
"On, on, in many cases"
Mm.
Go on.
"I mean if I took your line, your, your logic and maybe I'm misinterpreting it, er we would not have changed anything when B E S came into, to our organization."
"And one of the most significant changes I wanted to make, and I think we have made was that the, the letting of contracts and the vetting of contracts and so on would be done by our Q Ss, in the same way as it is for the civil work"
Indeed.
"for a very simple purpose and that is that it, it improves our internal control."
Yeah.
"It puts an in a a almost er an independent view in there, of the costs and valuation of variations and so on."
"Now I, I think perhaps you're worrying unduly, Jim in so far as, your, your men will continue to administer contracts in the way they do now."
"The they still issue the certificate to the client, which is signed off price correct."
Yes.
"For them to sign off price correct, they have got to have had a look at the measure."
Haven't they?
Well they don't.
"Cos that's what happened to Brian, you know when Brian had his Orion nicked?got stopped in"
the cars or something?
Little Sutton  cars.
"And then, it's taking him ages to get"
Has he got it now though?
Yeah.
But er the things that they were doing were just unbelievable.
Erm you know to get the chassis numbers and that.
"buying old  say a scrapped  a written off Sierra you know, picking them up cheap for about a thousand quid from the scrappy"
Yeah.
"and then getting all the  the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and    Because what, you know, er Siobhan's dad had a, bought a Montego  and  I don't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it's had a Maestro engine in it and it had  this that and the other."
And er they had to repossess it and he was paying .
"And I don't know how, what's happened about it now but at the time he was still having to pay for it"
Mhm.
even though they'd taken the car.
"there was a woman there that erm  the  police do this service thing where they'll look a car over for you, if you bought a car that you know has been er  in an accident and it's been"
Yeah.
they will have a look at it over  and check it over.
"And there was a woman on it, she had a really nice Orion, a J reg."
"Anyway when they  had a good look at it the front half was an Escort  and the back half was an Orion, half a stolen car."
You know they hadn't even matched the same bloody  type of car.
There's not really a lot of difference though is there between
There is
"Well there isn't and I I said to Mike what did it look like, you know?"
He said it was nice.
But when they're doing these welding jobs they haven't got them on those things so  as they're doing it like it's all moving and
Yeah.
Yeah they're totally
it was just a complete bodge.
I if you're driving along you can throw out the balance of the car.
Yeah.
"Well it was that erm one in Manchester, that crash  you know there was three people killed in the middle of Manchester wasn't there?"
"You know, where's our right to life come from?"
I think you can far too sentimental about it!
"Erm  humans are more important than animals, you you cannot gi equate an animal life with human life."
We are the intelligent order.
"Being intelligent, we hope we won't be cruel to animals, but you can't say that we are, animals are just as important as humans."
Mhm.
"Wha , why do you think we are more intelligent than animals?"
"Well, for a start"
"You know , because we can have television"
we could
studios?
No!
"We can reason with each other, animals don't reason with"
But
other.
"We have conversations, animals don't have conversations!"
"We are, we are living in a world , we are living in a world where constantly there's violence, does that happen in the animal world!"
Yes of course it does!
Of course it does!
Of course it does!
To the same extent?
They're horrible!
Animals are terribly cruel to each other!
N no well
Yes?
I can't accept that!
"Surely if intelligence is the answer, you know, what about mentally handicapped children?"
"They're, they're not intelligent, does that mean they're just the same as animals?"
"If intelligence is the criteria, then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals!"
Mhm.
We have a choice if we want to be involved in research
Mhm.
And there used to be a a lean to just there.
That doorway is still there.
"C C eighteen sixty seven, Charles ."
"Er it's not the date the place was built, it's the date it er the last time that that particular area was erm rebuilt."
"They had a number of fires over the years at  's Mill, er and one was in eighteen sixty six or sixty seven."
Erm and er that rebuilding was the was when erm that part of the job was er was done.
There's a picture that I obtained from actually Ruth  who was who was a Miss .
"Erm and it shows it's the twenty I think it's the twenty second or twenty third I've got it at home, er of October nineteen fourteen, this."
"Erm and it's the the livery of the first full load of coal, into round the back of the er  's Mill, erm and there's there's fifteen eight ton  Railway wagons there, full of coal, just erm coming."
"And it's an  twelve twenty seven, Railway, M R on the front as as standard."
"And er bit misty, but that's looking out from the signal box, you can just, possibly just about make out there, and at the back erm the er er with the the erm station master's house etcetera."
"Er that was taken out I say in in due course,"
"but erm er I think that er that picture I borrowed, I mean with her permission of course, erm and er I think it was hung up in the bathroom or somewhere, which was not the best place for a photograph to be really."
"And so I took  with I say with her blessing, took a er a picture of it for posterity."
". Erm that's a er rather nice picture, erm which has never been published, not at the moment anyhow."
"Erm and it was one that erm er Mr  gave me, many years ago when I was involved with the  Cricket Club, about nineteen seventy seven I think it was."
"He knew I was interested in railways and his grand grandfather I think, or uncle was er  photographer of the town."
And this was a photograph erm taken from the roof of the engine shed.
And about er I'd guess about nineteen nineteen.
Nineteen twenty perhaps.
And you're looking up towards .
I don't know why I'm not really using this er this pointer.
Well perhaps cos you can't see it.
Erm the er  Arms over there.
The cattle dock here.
"Er a loading gauge just here, to ensure that er anything coming out of that er er that had been loaded in the goods shed was not erm overloaded, and likely to hit tunnels and bridges and so on."
"There's the wagon turntable, that we mentioned."
That end loading er and ramp at er the end.
That's a er that's a  Railway horsebox there.
Erm and the line running into the goods shed there.
Erm you've got er fire buckets on the end.
"Er a warning not to trespass or something,careful about that."
Very good.
"We got our free milk, of course, we got our free milk."
"That was one  we got our free milk  as many pints of milk as we required for to keep our fam but no more, no more than that, just  much your family had they'd allow you a pint per  per person."
Was it erm was it hard work in the in the creamery?
Oh no.
No not in comparison to the jobs I'd already been in.
Oh no this was much easier for me.
Because   at that time .
And er after this did you move back to Edinburgh?
"I moved back to Edinburgh too because er my er my family had taken a yearning for Edinburgh, they didn't like East Kilbride so I says  left."
"And also it's true today, you go where your family wants to go and that was, this was er they had a yearning for that and they were not settling down so"
What did you do when you when you moved back to Edinburgh?
"Well I went into a timber yard er known as er, what was the timber yard again now?"
.
And they .
Where as I said  er working with timber.
Was that erm like sawmill or something?
"Sawmills, sawmills and ."
Cabinet makers
Was that a dangerous job?
"Well it could be dangerous, if you didn't watch what you were doing."
"Like every other, other job you've got to er gain experience as you go along, you've got to experience."
"And you've always got to, you've always g advice and on how to handle it before you, you put  actually handling them."
Were there erm any accidents or anything?
"Er but if there was any accidents through negligence, if there were accidents, it was negligence er and the people by themselves."
"Which is er worker often, often  often most of our accidents is caused by negligence."
So what were the conditions in the er in the mill like?
"Very good, very good conditions."
"Very good conditions indeed, aye."
Was there a union there as well?
Er there w wasn't a union then.
Mm.
Alright.
I'll give you something to
"I'm going tomorrow morning there anyway cos Roy's just given me a call, they've got some problems with  screw support bearings locking up, but er I'll go over there some time"
Right.
.
Yeah .
Yeah.
.
So I'll  Sally .
"Okay, is that happiness?"
"Right, yeah okay."
Erm just the  one's me main concern.
I mean the others you know it's it's what we get and and  sort of thing.
With them it's it's yeah.
Mm.
Erm I'm not happy with them and I don't know how you get round it .
Knowing what's happening there.
Well er at the end of the day it may be one that we're gonna we're gonna lose but erm
Mm.
If it is
Love the ultimate four letter word and were about to use it all over your television screen.
"Where do you start with love, every body wants to love, every body wants to be loved, every one at some time or another is disappointed by love and while its difficult sometimes talking about it not talking about it can have some really serious consequences, so let's try to get to the heart of it tonight, one hundred women are prepared to share their wisdom if not their secrets, I'd like to start off by seeing if we can differentiate between loving and being in love."
"Have you ever been in love?, are you now?, button one for yes, button two for no  and in this hundred, woof ninety three people have been in love, what, what happened?,"
"I mean what, what how did you know you were in love?"
"How did you know that was, that, that was what it was?, yes"
Temporary madness
can
only temporary
"er, well it does wear off you can't, you can't, you can't"
sustain it indefinitely
"and what, what were the symptoms in your case?"
Your mad!
"What is it though, what's historical linguistics?"
Is it like what we do in Old English or not?
Cos that
Yeah it is.
That sounds excellent.
Right it's due in week three I think.
Hurray.
"Er but  as far as I'm concerned if it comes in in week four, that's fair enough, but things after that then they start to get a bit upset"
"But I sa I said to Chris, When is it?"
"She said, Week three."
"Er and I said, Give or take a few days, and she said, Yeah."
"So if it's inside week four then that will quite reasonable, does that sound okay?"
Okay has anyone had a think about what they want to do?
I mean does anybody else know?
sort of everything we've had so far's been pretty general.
Okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder  and people have a listen to it.
But obviously if you're going to do that you'll have to do it during next week some time  On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one.
Yeah Oh yeah I mean there's five five things five things in men or women's conversation t to do and essay about.
"Say one about interrupting, one about topics, and one about perhaps interaction with children, one about er  what    Or you could even I mean if I did er I did a list of that you could even do the same one, you wouldn't have to do one each."
You know you got your erm tag questions?
Yeah.
might not be one of the question in it as  tag questions could be
Oh yeah.
specific.
Okay er  There's one title I've got written down here which I don't know if anyone's interested in.
Evaluate the claim that women are more d ob Evaluate the claim that women are more observant of the prestige norms in their speech than men are.
Does anyone fancy that?
Let's If I write down   Okay the  which I've just suddenly thought of were er
"turn-taking and interruptions and overlap and tags and tag questions, topic selection and interaction with children, which I think I just mentioned make sure you've got them down so we can forget them."
Er
What?
Alright.
May we go sir?
"Yes, you can leave the court now."
Thank you.
Back to case thirty one.
Miss  apparently you represent Mr   er well I  I notice from the documents with the er  summons it was adjourned  because erm  their solicitor wrote to say that he will be claiming not guilty?
Oh yes.
Is that the case?
"Yeah, your worships I understand that the  the prosecution are  are making application   I don't that you should go on with this."
So is it ?
If if it's not going to trial
When they were
we'll do it now we'll take it now.
"I wonder if I can insist, it isn't a matter where  and they have spoken to me about this  particular case  and"
Go to forty five your worship.
"Sorry, I forgot the"
"The view of the prosecution that this is matter  could be dealt with  quite satisfactorily by the way of  in the court  were minded to do that, if the court would accept that course of action."
I understand that Mr  would be  willing to be bound over.
Does that compare with that ?
Well obviously Miss  the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds  why they should bind him over  they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future  otherwise they will not bind him over.
"I appreciate that sir, but you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear  conducts from the case and if he is still present obviously  whatever the court wishes to do."
"I see, well in that case then I will leave it alone, I'll deal with this a little bit later on, obviously  it could take"
As you want.
possibly .
Who else is present Mrs ?
"Er  number forty one sir,."
Do deal with that your worships  please?
Forty one .
Are you Sylvia ?
Yes.
What is your date of birth please?
Ha?
"curiously enough, they seem to have I mean I I have"
"Yeah, but they have only to do with things like national security and and"
"Yes but er I I think that erm er the little by little, the conventions have been stretched."
And of course there's huge
do you think they should be tightened up again?
There's huge money.
Dramatic money.
You know.
"And and and and have no illusions, the money and the contents are very linked."
"That it's no use going round saying, Well here's my view of history as I wrote it."
"Er and it's factual it's it's analytical, it's it's erm devoid of the sort of bitchiness of politics."
Cos you won't get enough money.
You mean people spice them up
"Oh yeah, sure sure."
You think Mrs Thatcher's done that?
I have no idea.
I wouldn't dream of making such an observation.
But it sounds as though you suspect that.
I I'm not going to be drawn even by your deft questioning
Alright but the rules
in this direction.
But the rules ought to be changed.
There ough the rules ought to be hardened up to stop this kind of thing going on
I I I I I doubt if you could have rules.
I doubt any more whether we live in the sort of society where you could have such rules.
"Since we're talking about rules, what about erm Mrs Thatcher, Lady Thatcher wanting to change the rules so that a sitting Prime Minister can't be challenged."
Oh no certainly not.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
"I w I I personally er made it clear at the time when they changed the rules er er fairly recently, that I didn't think they should."
"Erm I think that er erm politicians understand full well the nature of the profession in which they're involved and the parliamentary party is erm more than able to exercise a proper judgement, er I don't think there's any case at all for er changing th I don't think there was a case for changing the rules and I don't think there is a case for changing the rules today."
So you're out of step with people like Douglas Hurd and Norman Fowler?
Where they'd come from?
On some cases yes because I was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber.
Well that er er er an Englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser.
As a man's hairdresser.
But somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no.
But that's what he's he told you?
Oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser.
And you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people.
Mm.
Too and who knows how they went to the road.
Mm.
Did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or.
It's said nowadays about drink but I don't know.
They they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know.
Mm.
So something just peculiar at that very time put them to the.
Did they ever do any form of casual work?
S some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the ar in in the harvest time.
Yes oh some would w w work but some wouldn't.
Er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub.
Mm.
What type of work did they  ?
Well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time.
And they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay.
Oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds.
And you wouldn't say oh I think it's going to be wet today John you better stay.
Not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it.
And were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character
Yes.
who sold goods
Oh oh yes er er who who sold.
Er there was one chappie that  er erm I can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap I suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite.
"Yes, it says"
It says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're no you're not reducing the size of the bus
well I think that's crazy
"And someone who's been u just used to driving a car, are they going to be able to drive a huge long bus with no extra tuition?"
Well
"Whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine, it doesn't alter the length of the bus"
"Well, I drive the mini bus at the hospital"
I know
Which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there's the drivers of the minibus thing at .
I think I I would query that anyway
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
"No, no but"
and just drive it
"But but I query as well whether, just because you reduce the number of passengers in it, that you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent, it isn't a P S V licence but it's it's"
have looked into that
"It sounds doubtful to me, but anyway, there's the insurance point of view, but anyway  if people whoa re willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out."
Y'know I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
Y'know I I drove the minibus with only somebody in with me before I drove it with people in it
Did you drive
"Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that"
"Yeah, but, you drove that one"
I drove it to Ashington and back
You drove  to Ashington in it.
Erm do you think I could throw these roses out?
"They're dead, aren't they?"
I'm afraid so
It's a shame
Pardon?
"They'll they'll have been forced from last Sunday, that was the  wasn't it?"
"I know, I know but they were dead by about Tuesday."
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
"Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now ."
But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll  put the answer phone on .
I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever.
Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with.
Is your's rude.
No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable
I  I
"and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down."
I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds.
And do they?
Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever.
I should've just say you're bragging.
"Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife?"
Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know.
So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere?
No no hon
There's not.
Any chips out there ?
Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not.
Okay.
I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm .
It sounds about par for the B B C.
"Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well  it's knackered er erm."
What?
Sorry.
I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it?
Yeah.
Okay er
Can the B B C afford these phone calls?
I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back.
Oh well you can call me back.
Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there?
"If they're blue, so am I"
I wonder if that miniature rose is gonna come up
"the w the one in the tub, no."
"Oh yeah, the one in the tub looks ok, it's the other one."
"I like the other one best as well, it's the peach one."
When're you going to prune them?
"Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's"
I wonder when er  going to have the erm
wheel barrow ready
Yes.
"Oh, it said in yesterday's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from her back garden and it was somewhere at , where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible."
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds cos it didn't it didn't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow"
Well there was er four
So we'll have to get it
Those four tapes incidentally  Tchaikovsky.
I sold them for fifteen pounds.
What four tapes?
The four tapes  sold them for fifteen pounds in
That who sent you?
That Shirley and Gareth sent me for Christmas
Oh.
I wish you would think of something you would like for your birthday
"I've told you, I want a  you need binoculars to go to Rome with"
I can't see very well through binoculars
The Cistine Chapel.
Unless we take those big ones with us.
"Oh Jim, they're too heavy"
"It doesn't need an easier camera, it needs you"
"What happens with that camera, you've got to rewind it every time."
"There's better ones now, automatic rewind, that's what I need."
You have never sat down and read
It's the rewind that's the problem
"Then there's, I, I, I'm the only person."
"quite a long time now I  begin to understand there are M S twos and threes are project engineers, and I"
Not necessarily.
No.
Er
They can be.
That was certainly my understanding and certainly
No.
if that is not the case then I'm gonna have to change the consultation documents because
No.
It's terminology isn't it?
No.
"Because, because the consultation"
We've
"documents clearly set out to the staff, what I thought was our collective understanding of the section engineer oblique project engineer relationship"
Right.
that section engineers at M S four level er acted as project coordinators or looked after their own element of the
Yeah.
"work, negotiated the er"
The fee
the fees
Yeah.
"and the remit with the client, and then delegated to, the work to a project engineer."
"And the project engineers were M S twos on medium jobs, small jobs, and M S threes on larger jobs."
And they were supported by a pool of engineers and technicians at
Mm.
M S one and P N T created .
Yeah.
But why can't the engineer at M S one level be project engineer
Because his responsibilities are different.
"in, in terms of"
Well.
And the  where the meeting of the day is at Lingfield Park.
First race there twelve twenty because there are eight races so an action-packed good value afternoon there.
An eighth of an inch of rain overnight but that shouldn't make any difference at all but a wet windy day.
No reported hazards.
Doesn't look a brilliant day does it weatherwise at the races  clouds.
Wetherby by the way  Tuesday third annual charity meeting in aid of the International Spinal Research Trust.
It's on Tuesday sixteenth of November.
A lot of local people have certainly er given generously so should be a good day's racing.
Always is at Wetherby if you can win there you can win anywhere.
But what about the guy who's won the Channel Four champion tipster competition for last week?
Let me first of all give you his name and I'll tell you what this guy's damn brilliant.
It is Robert  from  road in  in Oxfordshire who got an amazing a hundred and thirty points.
Now I say amazing let's just see where he got his winners.
"Now  that okay no problems there,second and third but look at this, he gave the first second and third and they didn't even have a handicap."
"Er the  Looking for a Rainbow, Flight Lieutenant, all skill of course, well you deserve that."
Well done Robert  and you get five hundred pounds.
We'll have another champion tipster competition in a fortnight here on Channel Four which will be coming from Newcastle.
Now let's test your turf knowledge as we go into the commercial break.
This er turf trivia today has been sent in by S  who comes from Great Lumley in County Down.
Know it well.
"He asks quite simply  with which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson Gold Cup four years running in nineteen sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one?"
You get scratching those  heads and I'll give you the answer in three minutes from now.
Okay did you get it right?
"With which horses did trainer Fred Rival win the Mackeson in sixty eight, sixty nine, seventy and seventy one four years running."
"They were  Jupiter Boy, Gay Trip, Chatham and Gay Trip again."
What an incredible performance that was.
Three different horses won it four years running.
The late and much missed Fred Rival By the way I saw Mercy at the horse of the year show a few weeks ago.
Still looking as good as ever.
"Erm  non runners, non runners there were three in so far, two of them were at Cheltenham."
They are Far Senior in the first in the twelve fifty and Panto Prince did not run in the Mackeson at two o'clock.
And Canderbill is out of the one fifteen at Nottingham.
Yeah I know.
I use contractions in the newsletter some times which is deliberately honest.
It's like saying avoid cliches like the plague.
I mean I I'd having been  these comments and yes there are a couple of extra points put in there I think that that's fine.
It's nice to get some of it done.
What about the rest of you lads?
Well as soon as I have a window in my diary which I'm not
We'll let you off with the newsletter.
contribution it is said.
Alright I'll I'll undertake to to come up with something for our next meeting.
I mean all I I didn't I just did exactly what I was told.
I put brought out a list of points.
There's no grammar in there.
There's contractions all over the place because erm and all sorts.
I even used numbers instead of writing them out in full verse.
So erm
You can minute me and I'll erm
Did you use any semicolons?
Probably put a split infinitive as well.
Well I've got the checking erm.
Right so Steve is undertaking to be the next brave soldier to  write something for
I don't know what I'm doing.
The general
We have to be very busy.
I mean this this this item has actually been deferred two meetings and
Mm.
Yeah.
We'll just been too busy.
Then I'll try and get something if I get time but.
Okay
Still I suppose the time's it's the actual the calendar's starting to tick for having this  isn't it now.
"Yeah if we're actually ever gonna make use of it we will, joking aside, have to try and get something  ."
"I I wrote to Atkins saying as Minister for the Environment er, Please support the energy conversation bill because it's dead good."
Presumably I can also write to John Gummer saying  is dead good.
Am I right to write to the others saying I or should
Oh yeah.
"I write to Gerry  saying say, Please prod Robert Atkins and remind him that the energy conservation bill's dead good in case he's forgotten."
Erm no I think the former I think the Parliamentary
But I can write to him in his capacity as Robert Atkins' Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Yes.
Cos otherwise it looks like writing to random M Ps.
I think you're sort of drawing drawing their attention to the public concern over that sort of phrase.
And widespread  cross party support.
Yes.
Honest guv.
wishy-washy statements for your audience.
I presume getting letters out is more important than high quality prose here is it?
Oh yes.
Just a couple
Cos I mean
of lines will do.
name name dropping the supporters I mean for to those Tories telling them that the that the association for county councils for example is a backer probably counts more than telling them that that   is a backer .
Yeah well I think particularly
or green particularly
doing their own I just take the letters I've already written to other people change one sentence and change the er name on
That's fine so
comrade.
Printed off on my er employer's er computer and er put it in one of their envelopes and try to steal a stamp from them.
We're gonna get it all down Andy don't worry.
How wide is the Green Party's main bill associated with  do you think?
Well in the main lobbyist has been Ron  who's the who's our elected campaigns officers and he's quite literally been spending time treading the the hallowed halls of Westminster
I mean in the media.
In the media I mean I haven't seen much about it in the media.
Er
Matters arising proposed and seconded that they be accepted  recommendations
"Yeah  no no, because there was no matters arising."
Just put that on so you can  proposing and seconding .
"Confusing, isn't it?"
"No, not really!"
Right
Secretary's report
Can we have the secretary's report.
Yeah.
"Erm  secretary's report, it's much the same as last year  er, we had two trips  this year  two coach trips  one to the Yorkshire Aquarist Festival in Ap was it April?"
"I think it was April, wasn't it?"
And one to the British Aquarist Festival in October.
"They were both enjoyable  erm  I can't really say which I enjoyed the most  er, I thought they were both very good  and of course good value for the money  because they don't charge very much for the fares  well I don't think they do."
"Erm  then we had the  three-way inter-club  table show  with Hulton and Skelmersdale and St Helens  erm  the first one was  St Helens  and that was the only  wasn't it, about April  and we won that  we, we  it was a whitewash really, wasn't it?"
"Erm  then we had one at Sk Hulton in July  and we won that  er, not quite as much of a whitewash was it?"
Nevertheless we won handsomely.
And the third one was at Skelm
Which was not organized because we don't know anyone
"which was   we don't know who won  we don't know what the score was but we think that   but we're, we're assuming that that's because they bring out all their secret showmen  who don't sh travel  they have a little core, hard core of  that don't travel  but they, they bring them out"
"they bring them out at their own table shows and, and it's"
Appropriate that we should  that much
Well that appears to be so .
I never cared for results  never cared for results at all.
Robert is
We never saw a fish either.
No.
"I don't think erm  on reflection, I don't think that a three-way table show is a good thing."
"I would prefer to see an inter-club with Skelm and an inter-club with Hulton I think they get too big, two clubs is too difficult to organize when there's three  cos you, you're getting  it's not , it's the"
It's not that   the show secretary was er  at  club  had not done his job.
At Skelmersdale?
Yeah.
I mean he's in the auction when he should be with them  writing the labels.
"I'm no longer, yes."
"The next, the next question is is jealousy another powerful promoter of family black sheep."
I'm not quite sure what that means.
Is is is is jealousy another power promoter of family black sheep.
"It is jealousy that pushes people into being  black sheep, into er doing something which is not acceptable."
"Yes, I think it can  part of it."
Mm.
Mm.
"You know one sees, rightly or wrongly, that the other one is having preferential treatment."
"Yeah, yeah."
And getting attention seeking.
"It could well have been the jealousy of the older brother, what caused him to be thought of as a black sheep."
"Black sheep, yes, yeah  So jealousy is quite powerful, could could be the driving force, between sons, yes."
sons.
In those days when there's land expected.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"This, by the way, erm, it it is applied with this study, and that is during the thirties, particularly on the, well it it actually carried on into the forties, but but the, there was a almost a  character in many plays, where one one character was, in effect, the family black sheep."
"Erm, there was  in Eden End, erm, there was another character in erm,there was a further one in"
"Oh, yes."
Yeah.
"Now, all these were black sheep, they were the nicest of the lot, and there was no, they were the ones you turned to, if you wanted to discuss your troubles."
"Not the other respectable brigade, and indeed in Eden End, the whole play turns on the jealousy of the sister, who remained at home."
Mm.
"The the family black sheep, the other sister went, er, er, left home to go on the stage."
"But of course, when she came back, all sorts of things began to happen, that's by the way."
"One other little point, in Brideshead Revisited, there's a character who never appears, she's always spoken about, and thwarted and that is  the man who Brideshead marries, and she says, talking to Julia, Julie was no better than she should have been."
"You know, she says, in every Catholic family, er, there is always a relapse person, and it's usually the nicest."
Aw.
Mm.
So even Evelyn Waugh's  told this story.
"Yes,"
"Yes, yes, yeah."
"It's not how many stocks and shares they've got, it's not what the size of their balance is, how much they've got on deposit account, how much credit, how credit worthy they are, that is not the richness of a man or a woman."
"Here the wise man says, the blessing of God, it makes a person rich  and it does not bring sorrow with it."
It's a strange verse.
Put it to the back of your mind a moment please.
"As I turn in to the book of Genesis I read there of God coming to Abraham, and saying to Abraham,that Abraham in your family all the nations of the world are gonna be blessed !"
How is that blessing gonna come?
It comes through the Messiah.
"It blessed the  for Abraham, the Messiah."
Jesus.
Because we become  middle class?
Because we've become better off?
Of course not!
We are blessed in him because he gave his life for us.
That is the source of God's blessing.
"Not in getting, but rather in giving."
"The apostle Paul when he's writing to the Corinthians in his first letter to them, one Corinthians  ."
Well what is this?
What's the definition?
"I suppose if I come around and ask each one of us this morning, can you give a definition?"
"I'm writing a dictionary and I'm stuck on a word, I want the definition of blessing."
"And I suppose for every person here, there would be a  I would say a similar, but a different er definition."
"There'd be a lot of similarity to it, and I think if we're honest  a lot of it would come back to things."
Well let's see what God himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing.
Gives it to us in psalm a hundred and thirty three  and it's in the last verse.
He is talking about God people being in unity.
"And he says, as a result of them being in unity, dwelling together in unity, he says it is there that the Lord commanded the blessing."
Whatever that is!
And it gives the blessing for what it is.
Life forever.
That is God's blessing!
That is God's blessing to you.
That is God's blessing on me.
"Erm, we're looking at all other things being equal."
"Let's assume that all the offspring are the same, in quality."
"Even, let's even make them all the age."
"Let's say they're all the same in quality, they're all the same in age."
There's still a difference as far as the parents are concerned.
Can anybody see what it is?
"Well, alright, I mean."
Let's deal with the first bit first.
Why should they treat them all equally?
"Why, why does the parent regard its offspring equally?"
In what sense?
Why?
This is the important one.
"From the parents' point of view, it is equally related to all its offspring."
"Now this is, this is the counter-intuitive bit."
Supposing I'm a parent.
"In fact,let let's do this in terms of a little diagram."
Let's put this on the board.
I'll do this in the lecture.
But let's just do it.
"It's easier if you do it on the board, and you can see it."
"Let's, supposing that I am the parent."
Okay.
I'm the parent P.
"Here am I, parent P, okay."
"I have two offspring, A and B which are smaller, little er A and B  offspring A and offspring B, and they are exactly equal in eve every point of view, size, quality and animal  okay."
"Now, erm, supposing that er, I have ten units of parental investment, and I invest ten in A and ten in B because I'm equally related to both of them."
Okay.
"Now, supposing that I want A to do something for B, like in  's case,A to give up a food item for B. Okay."
"Now as far as I'm concerned, if the benefit to B is greater, supposing for example, they're not the same age, sorry, I shouldn't have said that about being the same age."
"Er, supposing they're not the same age."
"But supposing I invested equal amounts of parental investment in both and supposing that if offspring A gives two units of parental investment to offspring B, the benefit to B's reproductive success will be three minutes, which it could be, if B was younger."
Yeah.
"Right,."
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
"It's, it's a bit cracked ."
It makes it very
"As I say it's better than, it's a bit better than it was."
But it's still not that
No.
good is it?
No.
No.
"Right, what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it damped down as quickly as we possibly can."
Now don't get rid of the Betnovate have you still got some left?
Mm.
Okay.
Because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to Betnovate to keep it maintained.
And you may actually have to use Betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again.
"Even if there's not a deal there, as soon as it starts  it's slightly flaky  straight in."
But what I'm gonna do is give you erm Dermavate Dermavate is actually more potent than Betnovate in the ointment form again to get the rapid penetration.
"And once again, like Betnovate it's used twice a day."
And in a similar fashion you should use the Dipabase to keep the skin as soft and moist as you can
Mhm.
rather than letting it get dried out and cracked.
"Dermavate is, as I say, it's more potent, it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with, but for jumping on top of things in a hurry, it's fine."
And I think that's what we ought to use.
"Sometimes you actually need to use it under something, but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand."
I don't know what you mean under
"Well sort of under a dressing, or"
Oh right.
"under a bit of polythene, so it, it actually gets absorbed even quicker."
Mm.
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got
Hold on.
Wha how  where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.
"There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals."
"And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a proggie mat exhibition."
A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat
Well
exhibition?
"well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it."
And various other art things.
"But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden  up."
"But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital."
"But then I thought, perhaps  if  that"
I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here
Well they won't
to go Ashington Hospital to do a
"they won't so the they, they"
garden.
"the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all"
No.
to pay for that.
I would expect
But then
that's a very low priority.
"well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing."
They won't get the money.
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming.
"But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus."
"I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see."
What  ?
"And straight away we say, well this procedure, doesn't work."
Yeah.
But it's
Right.
Yeah.
"come out, it's come out early."
Damn it all.
"We had a procedure erm about senior project engineers, er about two years before we"
We've gotta keep repeating that.
Er
does it?
put that into the bridge office in
Mhm.
intended .
Right.
"The thing with this , the thing that puzzles me a bit er"
Just because you booked that
"on this, and I'll reiterate this, is the process that we go through as I understand it for introducing procedures, is that we take a diagonal slice through the organization  er in other words there's a draft procedure produced."
That is sent round to people who will have been involved.
"They have the opportunity to input, it is amended er taking account of, of the comments"
Taking account of some of the comments.
It can never take account of all the comments.
Of course it can't.
It will always be compromise.
But by a very virtue of the draft going round and being commented on people are aware then
We don't see
.
Mm.
all the drafts
No.
Wh what wh where
Mr
Yes.
"Obviously there are a number of detailed points and these are just the ones that are coming off the top of this meeting and you will have more when you take them home and, and read them."
"Most of the schemes that are put in here are actually assessed by the area highway engineer and if you've got particular schemes, especially ones that you know you've talked about in the past, the best way of dealing with them is to speak to him directly and say, why isn't it in this time?"
If you're not happy with the answer then I'd be pleased to hear about it and er and er obviously we can assess the priority .
"Erm, on  there's a specific question I'd like to ask er  if he could throw some light on that one."
"Yes, if I can mention that the  is on the  and it's really associated with the government's intention to raise the er limit of lorries to forty tons by nineteen ninety nine."
Now what we have done is looked at s these causeway relief arches which  pass the water from one side of the  to the other at .
We've looked at those and the v they have very seriously deteriorated.
"The concrete's spalling, the reinforcement is being attacked and we've looked at various ways in which they can be repaired or replaced."
"To replace them, for example, would cost something over a million pounds, but this is actually a repair to those er culverts  the ."
"Right, thank you Mr ."
"Right, can I take you to the recommendation on page nine that the programme be circulated to all members of the committee."
Erm
Quickly then
I  would be the case
No er
He's got a beard.
Oh dear
Ken
On erm
Ken  yeah that's it.
Bruce?
"Bruce, yeah."
That's it.
Yeah.
I like him.
Oh I used to listen to that for ages.
Mm.
I like him I do.
"He, he has some lovely records."
"Good, good choice, you know?"
Well after after the big box pile up I'm I'm free on the Green Party.
And then the elections and then get our act together.
I don't think we need to be too sorry at the reason we're not getting it written is we're far too busy lobbying MPs and making protests in the centre of town and things.
So it's probably good rather
On balance.
Right.
Any other business?
I've got a couple of things.
Do we have nominations for conference reps and local election candidates?
Because these will need to go in the selection ballot in the newsletter what I am going to write.
Oh er you mean from people here?
Well
Yes?
Or I mean the flood of phone calls that have no doubt saved the erm Green Party .
Oh I'd I'd like to be a a delegate at conference but I can't be a candidate this year cos I'm captain of my and I think I'll be a bit busy anyway to be honest doing press work.
It would be nice to have a break from doing it.
Right.
Anybody wish to be put forward as conference attender?
The number is unlimited is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have three voting certificates but you can pass them around
It's a shared job.
Yeah.
Oh might as well then.
You just have to be approved by the  that's all.
Yeah I'll do that thing.
Right so that's got three so far and
I mean I think if you're not sure whether you want whether you'll be able to go  I mean you can still you can still be a  delegate then if you do go then you're able to vote so.
So you'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you?
Doesn't mean you have to go.
Just means that if you do go you
"I believe there is so now, but there wasn't then."
"So it, it didn't really matter to me."
I've always still held my card.
Although I still held my card of the Transport and General Workers.
Mhm.
So you continue to be a member of the Transport and General
"Oh aye, yes, oh ."
Oh yes.
"God I  you could never tell if you're, you're going to be there long enough in job, if the, the boss didn't like you then he would just say well you're, you're paid off and that's it, so that's sort of benefit of keeping your union membership up you could go to anywhere where there was a trade union, a union membership and get a job."
"So er the, was being unemployed at that time quite precarious?"
If there was
"It was, it was."
"At that time, yes."
"It was er at that time because of the, they were very few and far between."
Employment was very few and far between.
"Because there wasn't the same amount of work,this is just after the war I'm talking about, and there wasn't so many  going then."
There were only starting making themselves then.
Er
"So were erm were jobs quite hard to come by in those days, after the war?"
Well er well it all depended on the individual themselves.
If there's a miner who's  in getting work.
Although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after.
Depending on the rate of wages.
Depending on the rate of wages.
"So you're actually, if you're going for a job, you want er for the highest place where you get the highest wages, which was a   for any working, you're going to"
What did you do after you left the erm after you left the timber mill?
"After the timber mill, er ."
Now can I remember about after the timber mill?
Let's see now.
My mind's a blank  I've been in that many different jobs now.
"I thought you said you were in a, a warehouse after that wasn't"
Oh that's right.
I saw him around two weeks ago at Wetherby and er I think he'll run well.
He was ten to one earlier in the week and the rain will have helped.
Yes I mean if it if it does go to good to soft he will like the ground.
There's a couple in there that would prefer it faster.
Mm.
Erm but at that sort of price I think he's opposable.
Well let's see what we can oppose him with.
"Bradley Star is a very nice horse he's a classy performer this one, Josh Gifford's horses are in tremendous form and I was talking to the man who who rides him Deckland Murphy he's my next door neighbour he thinks he'll run a big race."
"He would be my pick I must say, of them  He's he's"
The trouble is he's run he's run some marvellous races but somehow when it comes to the crunch and er in in in better class races he just gets just gets beat.
He loves Cheltenham though I mean he's had four firsts and a second
"Erm, he's only won I admit"
yeah
he's only once been beaten at Cheltenham .
Erm another I know er I've spoken to Deckland Murphy as well being the Newmarket's jumps jockey and erm they think he's the Gold Cup horse well if he is he's gonna have to put in a good performance today then I'd stick with him.
Think he's gonna win?
Yeah exactly.
It's a it's a very very good race this and one of the good horses is a horse called General Idea.
Now what a training performance this would be if this horse could win because he's trained by Dermott Wilde and do you remember ten days ago he sent out Vintage Crop to win the Melbourne Cup down in Australia.
Well the word from Ireland this week is that this horse is jumping out of its skin.
The only problem is that the ground now might well have gone against this horse.
But he did win the Galway Plate earlier this summer.
This is fast ground
At Galway and that's the problem with General Idea as you say Derek er if it gets softer like at Cheltenham that will be very much against him.
But er it doesn't look like a steeplechase but  it is in fact
a two mile  steeplechase the Galway Plate and General Idea running really well from  and  Express  but the ground's the problem.
and lighter weight as well last year and has more weight today so he's had he would have had to have improved about four or five pounds to win today?
That's right.
And there's very li very little between him and er the the other ex-Irish horse Second Schedule.
Exactly.
Well let's have a look we've got er Second Schedule.
Now he's recently joined David Nicholson's stable.
"Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's  erm   he's got a  he's gotta go at four  actually go at four not  an appointment, he's gotta go at four."
Why erm  why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
"Well I don't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent."
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Well it's erm  the sort of things they pick them on really is not that
Not hygiene sort of thing?
"No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to  know what they're talking about but  I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room"
Mhm.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's gotta go on a special one?
It's gotta go on a steel pallet  and yet next door  in the export chiller  they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet  and we work on wooden pallets  erm
I'm surprised they use wood.
Well if you see how many pallets they got  and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery  they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
"Yeah I suppose they would, yeah."
There's loads of things they're on about  oh th the there's a whole  book what they gotta h have sorted out.
Do they?
Oh Christ yeah!
"Certain doors are not to be opened  things like emergency exits there's  they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door don't even open."
Bloody hell!
So all that stuff
"Well then that is, that's gotta be sorted out because if you"
Yeah.
"had a fire there, somebody wouldn't get out properly!"
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we haven't got an emergency exit.
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
"Well there's a bloody great  roller door, but you see it's at the end  we work"
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
Well exactly!
How would you get out?
And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in.
And the information's recorded on the cartridge.
And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel  is
Yeah.
"and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever."
Ah.
"So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine  you know."
"But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside"
Yeah.
obviously but I think you need  clearly in the first instance to use that
And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got
"Well I, it's just a thought."
I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether
Yeah.
"just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some  origin destination surveys  interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it  that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere."
"Erm  and erm  you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones  census point and so on"
Yeah.
"and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem."
Yeah.
Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them.
"Cos presumably, when you look at the layout  most of the signs are keep left signs."
Yeah.
Or you get the  you get ones that are sort of road narrows
Yeah.
"and you get the, the warning ones."
Yeah.
And the warning ones have a little census  plate on.
Erm  so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that.
But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they?
Yeah.
"So the only ones you really need  and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock."
Yeah.
My brother-in-law said he read in the paper that erm  over a year sort of  the amount of oil tipped on our land and down drains which shouldn't be there is almost like equivalent to the disaster at Exxon Valdez.
I heard that.
"Th erm  the amount of oil that people just tip on the ground, or down the drains or whatever"
Mm.
over a year is equivalent to the disaster of the Exxon Valdez.
So really people ought to be trained to take their engine oil out
"There's this, there's this er out of sight out of mind principal"
You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for  decades already.
"You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street  because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering, into the"
They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany mustn't they?
Well it's just so incredible that this oil has never been  I mean nobody focused on it did they?
No.
People just don't think.
They just tip it oh tip it down the drain.
Same with petrol stations I mean  the way they  spill the petrol.
I know!
There used to be safety catch mechanism
Yeah.
but there isn't now is there it just comes splashing out.
Well really I mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
they had a row at erm petrol station when that happened to her.
And they said it was our car.
"and, and it went, cos it was quite a bit more worth petrol that went all over the place."
And she refused to pay.
And they  me up about it.
"I, I sort of denied all knowledge ."
I didn't know it had happened!
I think they were being most unreasonable.
We at the time the attendant said it was alright.
She didn't have to pay for it.
it could easily  I mean  will be shorter I think.
Sorry?
"But I'll write her a postcard to say, Yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works."
Yeah and confirm that that isn't a daily price.
I think that I'll have to confirm with the company.
Yes.
But it just just seems suspiciously cheap.
That twelve
Well I mean it's not the huge massive billboards.
I mean if they're just sort of four foot things I mean it's not you know I think.
Yeah perhaps.
Anyway  that's really into this idea.
Especially Bob's suggestion of calling for people to sponsor
Sponsor
sponsor a poster.
Erm should I at least be prepared to again stick something in the newsletter about .
As you say it's the sort of thing that might appeal to people because then they can go and look at their poster.
Be photographed next to it.
What do you think?
We could always do  posting on the side of the Conservative building.
Your direct your direct action at home.
Yes well come and visit you in prison.
Right does that cover billboards?
Yep.
no that was a good agenda item just got silly.
Okay.
Who wanted to talk about affiliation stroke working with other groups?
This is something we said we were going to discuss at a time in the future and I thought I'd stick it on and see how much time we'd got left.
Right.
Well we've got twenty five minutes at present shall we can you just wipe around a couple of other things and then we'll come back to that if time remains?
Yes do.
Okay.
Right intro leaflet.
Do I hear apathy?
The same building.
If you look at the look at that building.
It's the same building.
"The gates, they only had a single er they didn't have gates on either side here, they just got the one set of gates."
Erm plus this er er for for passengers.
But there wasn't there wasn't another set this side.
Wasn't room.
In fact it's a very narrow er er roadway there.
It still is.
Little er signal box at .
I managed to go in and have a chat with the signalman.
"Erm pretty little thing, the  er boxes are very standard er in design, they're they were varying in size, but erm the er sort of double hipped roof, the finials erm the angled corners, of the windows erm the er er the rails erm and the er sort of platform there, er very very standard er all over the place."
"They've got quite a few of these at erm at , at the  Railway Trust, they've er they've got a number of these signal boxes."
"They reckon they've probably got more than B R now, there."
Er but a pretty little box that is.
That's another view of the of the same box.
"Now a little bit further up the line, whoops, is junction."
"Now used to be er a link line between erm this er track here, and round the back, erm under  Road, there's still a bridge there, er and joined up near where the rubbish tip is."
"Erm and er so trains could er instead of going towards Lincoln having to perhaps back up to, they would go round er a triangle basically, and be facing towards , equally if they're coming back, they didn't have to go towards Lincoln, and then back, they could erm could erm go round and er take their wares to  sidings and marshalling yards."
"Er inside, er is a wheel which with which the erm signal box, or signalman, er could er open and shut the gates as necessary."
"And er a line of levers for points, for signals, and some spares inside."
"And that was er duly inside, you've got a fair number of spares on that."
"The reds where the home signals, yellow, the distance, and I this the black were points were they not."
"That's looking up er towards er Nottingham,."
". Long time ago,."
"An old, a very old photograph and a bit grainy."
But erm a train just coming in er from Lincoln to Nottingham.
. That's gone now.
"The signal box and the gates have gone, taken now probably five or six years or so ago."
"Again typical er  box, erm rather attractive, has now got the er normal lifting barriers."
There you can see the er  box.
"Erm and er the er  whatd'youcallit, the the er er the level crossing er and house."
How you going to know exactly where the boundaries go or i in between some land-lock countries  that you got it in the right position
How many land-lock countries are there in South America?
"Well enough anyway, I mean I thought you were giving me something easier to do not"
Well I think  why would you do it tonight if I didn't have it?
Yes
Say I didn't have it tomorrow you'd
well
do it tonight?
probably ni or tomorrow I was gonna do that.
"I seem to think you should take the easy bit, cos that's gonna be miles too hard!"
"No I like to balance it, I ju there's some balance there, there's some easy ones and some hard ones."
I'll tell you what's best for Michael.
I don't feel that's very good  because you're just gonna get children totally pull out of it unless they're
No.
really really good.
Children are allowed to go
"You find that if if if i in a team, if there's teams  i you find that in a singles, but if there's a team e if everybody feels the everybody feels they can contribute something to it  when you've got"
You can have those
"allowed to be the idea of that, you don't wanna make it"
Yeah I know
too easy
No there are no husbands allowed to be with any wife  and children can attach themselves to which group they want.
"So work out the groups, you work out the groups."
Well there's going to be  apart from your father there's going to be seven adults.
"Listen, a man with a woman  but not wi not  by marriage  cos say like Andy with Nanna"
"Well I could go with two children, I expect."
"Well write down the names let's have a go at, let's work out, let's work out the teams"
"Cos I'm the cleverest person, I can go with two teenies!"
"lo , write down the names."
Modest!
No and I could be the only adult with two children cos I'm so clever.
Write down the names and th work out some balanced teams then for me please.
"`` There are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there , and several little jobs of work you can do for me . ''"
`` Can I ? ''
and Dan looked both surprised and pleased .
`` You can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play .
"You can amuse Teddy for me , wind cotton , read to me when I sew , and do many things without hurting your foot , which will make the days pass quickly , and not be wasted ones . ''"
"Here Demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand , and a very ugly little toad in the other ."
"`` See , Dan , I found them , and ran back to give them to you ; are n't they beautiful ones ? ''"
"panted Demi , all out of breath ."
"Dan laughed at the toad , and said he had no place to put him , but the butterfly was a beauty , and if Mrs. Jo would give him a big pin , he would stick it right up in the drawer ."
"`` I do n't like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin ; if it must be killed , let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor , '' said Mrs. Jo , getting out the bottle ."
"`` I know how to do it Mr. Hyde always killed 'em that way but I did n't have any camphor , so I use a pin , '' and Dan gently poured a drop on the insect 's head , when the pale green wings fluttered an instant , and then grew still ."
"This dainty little execution was hardly over when Teddy shouted from the bedroom , `` Oh , the little trabs are out , and the big one 's eaten 'em all up . ''"
"Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue , and found Teddy dancing excitedly in a chair , while two little crabs were scuttling about the floor , having got through the wires of the cage ."
"A third was clinging to the top of the cage , evidently in terror of his life , for below appeared a sad yet funny sight ."
"The big crab had wedged himself into the little recess where Polly 's cup used to stand , and there he sat eating one of his relations in the coolest way ."
"All the claws of the poor victim were pulled off , and he was turned upside down , his upper shell held in one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish , while he leisurely ate out of it with the other claw , pausing now and then to turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side , and to put out a slender tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with laughter ."
"Mrs. Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight , while Demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted wash-bowl ."
"`` I 'll have to let these fellers go , for I ca n't keep 'em in the house , '' said Dan , with evident regret ."
"`` I 'll take care of them for you , if you will tell me how , and they can live in my turtle-tank just as well as not , '' said Demi , who found them more interesting even that his beloved slow turtles ."
"So Dan gave him directions about the wants and habits of the crabs , and Demi bore them away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors ."
`` What a good boy he is ! ''
"said Dan , carefully settling the first butterfly , and remembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him ."
"`` He ought to be , for a great deal has been done to make him so . ''"
"`` He 's had folks to tell him things , and to help him ; I have n't , '' said Dan , with a sigh , thinking of his neglected childhood , a thing he seldom did , and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow ."
"`` I know it , dear , and for that reason I do n't expect as much from you as from Demi , though he is younger ; you shall have all the help that we can give you now , and I hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best way ."
"Have you forgotten what Father Bhaer told you when you were here before , about wanting to be good , and asking God to help you ? ''"
"`` No , ma'am , '' very low ."
`` Do you try that way still ? ''
"`` No , ma'am , '' lower still ."
`` Will you do it every night to please me ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' very soberly ."
"`` I shall depend on it , and I think I shall know if you are faithful to your promise , for these things always show to people who believe in them , though not a word is said ."
"As soon as he saw this proclamation the boy called his sister , and they hastened to the palace ."
"The bird was buttoned inside his tunic , but , as might have been expected , the courtiers barred the way , and told the child that he could not enter ."
"It was in vain that the boy declared that he was only obeying the king 's commands ; the courtiers only replied that his majesty was not yet out of bed , and it was forbidden to wake him ."
"They were still talking , when , suddenly , the bird settled the question by flying upwards through an open window into the king 's own room ."
"Alighting on the pillow , close to the king 's head , she bowed respectfully , and said : ` My lord , I am the Bird of Truth whom you wished to see , and I have been obliged to approach you in the manner because the boy who brought me is kept out of the palace by your courtiers . '"
"` They shall pay for their insolence , ' said the king ."
"And he instantly ordered one of his attendants to conduct the boy at once to his apartments ; and in a moment more the prince entered , holding his sister by the hand ."
` Who are you ? '
asked the king ; ` and what has the Bird of Truth to do with you ? '
"` If it please your majesty , the Bird of Truth will explain that herself , ' answered the boy ."
And the bird did explain ; and the king heard for the first time of the wicked plot that had been successful for so many years .
"He took his children in his arms , with tears in his eyes , and hurried off with them to the tower in the mountains where the queen was shut up ."
"The poor woman was as white as marble , for she had been living almost in darkness ; but when she saw her husband and children , the colour came back to her face , and she was as beautiful as ever ."
"They all returned in state to the city , where great rejoicings were held ."
"The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off , and all their property was taken away ."
"As for the good old couple , they were given riches and honour , and were loved and cherished to the end of their lives ."
"The Mink and the Wolf -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts .
"They were always very polite when they met ; but , in spite of that , they kept a close watch one upon the other , as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else ."
But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that .
"One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt , promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime ."
"He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his , just where the river runs into the sea ."
"There , just as he had hoped , he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe . '"
"I want to fish too , ' cried the wolf ."
But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . '
I wish you would take me into your boat ! '
"shouted the wolf , louder than before , and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it , and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in ."
"` Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset , ' said the mink ; ` and if you care about sea-urchins ' eggs , you will find plenty in that basket ."
"But be sure you eat only the white ones , for the red ones would kill you . '"
"So the wolf , who was always hungry , began to eat the eggs greedily ; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap ."
"` Well , then , stretch yourself out , and rest your head on that piece of wood , ' said the mink ."
"And the wolf did as he was bid , and was soon fast asleep ."
"I frolicked in the park with dogs , sailed boats in the Back Bay with strange boys , dined with a little Irish beggar-girl on salt fish and potatoes , and was found at last fast asleep on a door-step with my arms round a great dog ."
"It was late in the evening , and I was a dirty as a little pig , and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled so far . ''"
`` How nice ! ''
"cried Nan , looking all ready to go and do it herself ."
`` It was not nice next day ; '' and Mrs. Jo tried to keep her eyes from betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers .
`` Did your mother whip you ? ''
"asked Nan , curiously ."
"`` She never whipped me but once , and then she begged my pardon , or I do n't think I ever should have forgiven her , it hurt my feelings so much . ''"
`` Why did she beg your pardon ?
my father do n't . ''
"`` Because , when she had done it , I turned round and said , ` Well , you are mad yourself , and ought to be whipped as much as me . '"
"She looked at me a minute , then her anger all died out , and she said , as if ashamed , ` You are right , Jo , I am angry ; and why should I punish you for being in a passion when I set you such a bad example ?"
"Forgive me , dear , and let us try to help one another in a better way . '"
"I never forgot it , and it did me more good than a dozen rods . ''"
"Nan sat thoughtfully turning the little cold-cream jar for a minute , and Mrs. Jo said nothing , but let that idea get well into the busy little mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her ."
"`` I like that , '' said Nan , presently , and her face looked less elfish , with its sharp eyes , inquisitive nose , and mischievous mouth ."
`` What did your mother do to you when you ran away that time ? ''
"`` She tied me to the bed-post with a long string , so that I could not go out of the room , and there I stayed all day with the little worn-out shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault . ''"
"`` I should think that would cure anybody , '' cried Nan , who loved her liberty above all things ."
"`` It did cure me , and I think it will you , so I am going to try it , '' said Mrs. Jo , suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her work-table ."
"Nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument now , and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs. Jo tied one end round her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa , saying , as she finished , `` I do n't like to tie you up like a naughty little dog , but if you do n't remember any better than a dog , I must treat you like one . ''"
"`` I 'd just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog ; '' and Nan put on a do n't - care face , and began to growl and grovel on the floor ."
"Mrs. Jo took no notice , but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to hem , she went away , and left Miss Nan to her own devices ."
"This was not agreeable , and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord ."
"But it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind , so she began on the knot at the other end ."
"It soon came loose , and , gathering it up , Nan was about to get out of the window , when she heard Mrs. Jo say to somebody as she passed through the hall , `` No , I do n't think she will run away now ; she is an honorable little girl , and knows that I do it to help her . ''"
"In a minute , Nan whisked back , tied herself up , and began to sew violently ."
"Rob came in a moment after , and was so charmed with the new punishment , that he got a jump-rope and tethered himself to the other arm of the sofa in the most social manner ."
"`` I got lost too , so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan , '' he explained to his mother when she saw the new captive ."
"`` I 'm not sure that you do n't deserve a little punishment , for you knew it was wrong to go far away from the rest . ''"
"`` Nan took me , '' began Rob , willing to enjoy the novel penalty , but not willing to take the blame ."
`` You need n't have gone .
"Hatch and Sir Oliver discussed together for a while their altered situation ; ten men , it was decided between them , should be reserved , not only to garrison the Moat House , but to escort the priest across the wood ."
"In the meantime , as Bennet was to remain behind , the command of the reinforcement was given to Master Shelton ."
"Indeed , there was no choice ; the men were loutish fellows , dull and unskilled in war , while Dick was not only popular , but resolute and grave beyond his age ."
"Although his youth had been spent in these rough , country places , the lad had been well taught in letters by Sir Oliver , and Hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command ."
"Bennet had always been kind and helpful ; he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies , but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends ; and now , while Sir Oliver entered the next house to write , in his swift , exquisite penmanship , a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master , Sir Daniel Brackley , Bennet came up to his pupil to wish him God-speed upon his enterprise ."
"`` Ye must go the long way about , Master Shelton , '' he said ; `` round by the bridge , for your life !"
"Keep a sure man fifty paces afore you , to draw shots ; and go softly till y ' are past the wood ."
"If the rogues fall upon you , ride for ` t ; ye will do naught by standing ."
"And keep ever forward , Master Shelton ; turn me not back again , an ye love your life ; there is no help in Tunstall , mind ye that ."
"And now , since ye go to the great wars about the king , and I continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life , and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below , I give you my last counsels now at your riding ."
Keep an eye on Sir Daniel ; he is unsure .
"Put not your trust in the jack-priest ; he intendeth not amiss , but doth the will of others ; it is a hand-gun for Sir Daniel !"
Get your good lordship where ye go ; make you strong friends ; look to it .
And think ever a pater-noster-while on Bennet Hatch .
There are worse rogues afoot than Bennet .
"So , God-speed ! ''"
"`` And Heaven be with you , Bennet ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Ye were a good friend to me-ward , and so I shall say ever . ''"
"`` And , look ye , master , '' added Hatch , with a certain embarrassment , `` if this Amend-All should get a shaft into me , ye might , mayhap , lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul ; for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory . ''"
"`` Ye shall have your will of it , Bennet , '' answered Dick ."
"`` But , what cheer , man !"
"we shall meet again , where ye shall have more need of ale than masses . ''"
"`` The saints so grant it , Master Dick ! ''"
returned the other .
`` But here comes Sir Oliver .
"An he were as quick with the long-bow as with the pen , he would be a brave man-at-arms . ''"
"Sir Oliver gave Dick a sealed packet , with this superscription : `` To my ryght worchypful master , Sir Daniel Brackley , knyght , be thys delyvered in haste . ''"
"And Dick , putting it in the bosom of his jacket , gave the word and set forth westward up the village ."
"BOOK I -- THE TWO LADS CHAPTER I -- AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY Sir Daniel and his men lay in and about Kettley that night , warmly quartered and well patrolled ."
"But the Knight of Tunstall was one who never rested from money-getting ; and even now , when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him , he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours ."
"He was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances ; it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant , and then , by the favour he curried with great lords about the king , procure unjust decisions in his favour ; or , if that was too roundabout , to seize the disputed manor by force of arms , and rely on his influence and Sir Oliver 's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched ."
"The land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there ."
"Climb on my back , and I will take you where you will . '"
"Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help ."
"But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there ."
"Uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads ."
"Oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea !"
"The young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls ."
"But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales ."
` Where have you brought me ? '
he asked his guide in a low voice .
"` To the palace of Ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . '"
"I am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess Otohime , whom you will shortly see . '"
"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next ."
"But the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival ."
"And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade ."
` Is not that reward enough ? '
"she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself ."
"And Uraschimataro said ` Yes , ' and so he stayed there ."
For how long ?
That he only knew later .
"His life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents ."
"He fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong ."
"Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more ."
"The princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen ."
"` You will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly ."
"But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ` Only this once will I leave you , and then will I return to your side for ever . '"
"Sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ` One way there is to bring you safely back , but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . ' '"
"I will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed Uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more ."
"Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to Uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it ."
"` If you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ` your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . '"
"Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding ."
"He hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess ."
"laughed Jack , adding , with great interest , `` What did the other fellow do ? ''"
"`` He went about fighting other people 's battles , helping the poor , and trying to do good ."
"But he lacked judgment , so he often got into trouble , and was in such a hurry that he did not always stop to find out the wisest way ."
"As when he gave away his best coat to a beggar boy , instead of the old one which he intended to give . ''"
"`` I say , that is n't fair , mother !"
"Neither of them was new , and the boy needed the best more than I did , and I wore the old one all winter , did n't I ? ''"
"asked Jack , who had rather exulted over Frank , and was now taken down himself ."
"`` Yes , you did , my dear ; and it was not an easy thing for my dandiprat to do ."
"Now listen , and I 'll tell you how they both learned to be wiser ."
"The elder prince soon found that the big dragons were too much for him , and set about training his own little one , who now and then ran away with him ."
"Its name was Will , a good servant , but a bad master ; so he learned to control it , and in time this gave him great power over himself , and fitted him to be a king over others . ''"
"`` Thank you , mother ; I 'll remember my part of the moral ."
"Now give Jack his , '' said Frank , who liked the dragon episode , as he had been wrestling with his own of late , and found it hard to manage ."
"`` He had a fine example before him in a friend , and he followed it more reasonably till he grew able to use wisely one of the best and noblest gifts of God -- benevolence . ''"
`` Now tell about the girl .
Was there more to that part of the story ? ''
"asked Jack , well pleased with his moral , as it took Ed in likewise ."
"`` That is the best of all , but it seems as if I never should get to it ."
"After Patience made Lucy sweet and cheerful , she began to have a curious power over those about her , and to work little miracles herself , though she did not know it ."
"The queen learned to love her so dearly she could not let her go ; she cheered up all her friends when they came with their small troubles ; the princes found bright eyes , willing hands , and a kind heart always at their service , and felt , without quite knowing why , that it was good for them to have a gentle little creature to care for ; so they softened their rough manners , loud voices , and careless ways , for her sake , and when it was proposed to take her away to her own home they could not give her up , but said she must stay longer , did n't they ? ''"
"`` I 'd like to see them saying anything else , '' said Frank , while Jack sat up to demand fiercely , -- `` Who talks about taking Jill away ? ''"
"`` Lucy 's mother thought she ought to go , and said so , but the queen told her how much good it did them all to have her there , and begged the dear woman to let her little cottage and come and be housekeeper in the palace , for the queen was getting lazy , and liked to sit and read , and talk and sew with Lucy , better than to look after things . ''"
`` And she said she would ? ''
"cried Jill , clasping her hands in her anxiety , for she had learned to love her cage now ."
`` Yes . ''
"Mrs. Minot had no time to say more , for one of the red slippers flew up in the air , and Jack had to clap both hands over his mouth to suppress the `` hurrah ! ''"
that nearly escaped .
"Frank said , `` That 's good ! ''"
"and nodded with his most cordial smile at Jill who pulled herself up with cheeks now as rosy as the red carnation , and a little catch in her breath as she said to herself , -- `` It 's too lovely to be true . ''"
"`` That 's a first-rate end to a very good story , '' began Jack , with grave decision , as he put on his slipper and sat up to pat Jill 's hand , wishing it was not quite so like a little claw ."
"`` That 's not the end ; '' and Mamma 's eyes laughed more than ever as three astonished faces turned to her , and three voices cried out , -- `` Still more ? ''"
`` The very best of all .
But that 's past praying for ; and ye must lie on your bed the way ye made it .
And the point in hand is just this : what did ye pay him ? ''
`` Has he tauld ye himsel ' ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` That 's my concern , '' said Alan ."
"`` Weel , '' said my uncle , `` I dinnae care what he said , he leed , and the solemn God 's truth is this , that I gave him twenty pound ."
"But I 'll be perfec ` ly honest with ye : forby that , he was to have the selling of the lad in Caroliny , whilk would be as muckle mair , but no from my pocket , ye see . ''"
"`` Thank you , Mr. Thomson ."
"That will do excellently well , '' said the lawyer , stepping forward ; and then mighty civilly , `` Good-evening , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ."
"And , `` Good-evening , Uncle Ebenezer , '' said I. And , `` It 's a braw nicht , Mr. Balfour , '' added Torrance ."
"Never a word said my uncle , neither black nor white ; but just sat where he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to stone ."
"Alan filched away his blunderbuss ; and the lawyer , taking him by the arm , plucked him up from the doorstep , led him into the kitchen , whither we all followed , and set him down in a chair beside the hearth , where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning ."
"There we all looked upon him for a while , exulting greatly in our success , but yet with a sort of pity for the man 's shame ."
"`` Come , come , Mr. Ebenezer , '' said the lawyer , `` you must not be down-hearted , for I promise you we shall make easy terms ."
"In the meanwhile give us the cellar key , and Torrance shall draw us a bottle of your father 's wine in honour of the event . ''"
"Then , turning to me and taking me by the hand , `` Mr. David , '' says he , `` I wish you all joy in your good fortune , which I believe to be deserved . ''"
"And then to Alan , with a spice of drollery , `` Mr. Thomson , I pay you my compliment ; it was most artfully conducted ; but in one point you somewhat outran my comprehension ."
Do I understand your name to be James ?
or Charles ?
"or is it George , perhaps ? ''"
"`` And why should it be any of the three , sir ? ''"
"quoth Alan , drawing himself up , like one who smelt an offence ."
"`` Only , sir , that you mentioned a king 's name , '' replied Rankeillor ; `` and as there has never yet been a King Thomson , or his fame at least has never come my way , I judged you must refer to that you had in baptism . ''"
"This was just the stab that Alan would feel keenest , and I am free to confess he took it very ill ."
"Not a word would he answer , but stepped off to the far end of the kitchen , and sat down and sulked ; and it was not till I stepped after him , and gave him my hand , and thanked him by title as the chief spring of my success , that he began to smile a bit , and was at last prevailed upon to join our party ."
"By that time we had the fire lighted , and a bottle of wine uncorked ; a good supper came out of the basket , to which Torrance and I and Alan set ourselves down ; while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next chamber to consult ."
"They stayed there closeted about an hour ; at the end of which period they had come to a good understanding , and my uncle and I set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner ."
"By the terms of this , my uncle bound himself to satisfy Rankeillor as to his intromissions , and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of Shaws ."
"So the beggar in the ballad had come home ; and when I lay down that night on the kitchen chests , I was a man of means and had a name in the country ."
"Alan and Torrance and Rankeillor slept and snored on their hard beds ; but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones , so many days and nights , and often with an empty belly , and in fear of death , this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the former evil ones ; and I lay till dawn , looking at the fire on the roof and planning the future ."
"CHAPTER XXX GOOD-BYE So far as I was concerned myself , I had come to port ; but I had still Alan , to whom I was so much beholden , on my hands ; and I felt besides a heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens ."
"On both these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning , walking to and fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws , and with nothing in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors ' and were now mine ."
"By good luck , his knife flew out of his hand as he fell ."
"I picked up both that and his brogues , wished him a good morning , and set off upon my way , leaving him barefoot and disarmed ."
"I chuckled to myself as I went , being sure I was done with that rogue , for a variety of reasons ."
"First , he knew he could have no more of my money ; next , the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence ; and , lastly , the knife , which was really a dagger , it was against the law for him to carry ."
"In about half an hour of walk , I overtook a great , ragged man , moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff ."
"He was quite blind , and told me he was a catechist , which should have put me at my ease ."
"But his face went against me ; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret ; and presently , as we began to go on alongside , I saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket ."
"To carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence , and transportation to the colonies upon a second ."
"Nor could I quite see why a religious teacher should go armed , or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol ."
"I told him about my guide , for I was proud of what I had done , and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence ."
"At the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two , and was glad he could not see my blushes ."
`` Was it too much ? ''
"I asked , a little faltering ."
`` Too much ! ''
cries he .
"`` Why , I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram of brandy ."
And give you the great pleasure of my company -LRB- me that is a man of some learning -RRB- in the bargain . ''
"I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide ; but at that he laughed aloud , and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle ."
"`` In the Isle of Mull , at least , '' says he , `` where I know every stone and heather-bush by mark of head ."
"See , now , '' he said , striking right and left , as if to make sure , `` down there a burn is running ; and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that ; and it 's hard at the foot of the hill , that the way runs by to Torosay ; and the way here , being for droves , is plainly trodden , and will show grassy through the heather . ''"
"I had to own he was right in every feature , and told my wonder ."
`` Ha ! ''
"says he , `` that 's nothing ."
"Would ye believe me now , that before the Act came out , and when there were weepons in this country , I could shoot ?"
"Ay , could I ! ''"
"cries he , and then with a leer : `` If ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with , I would show ye how it 's done . ''"
"I told him I had nothing of the sort , and gave him a wider berth ."
"If he had known , his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket , and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt ."
"But by the better luck for me , he knew nothing , thought all was covered , and lied on in the dark ."
"He then began to question me cunningly , where I came from , whether I was rich , whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him -LRB- which he declared he had that moment in his sporran -RRB- , and all the time he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him ."
"We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay , and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel ."
"I had so plainly the upper-hand that my spirits rose , and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman 's buff ; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier , and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff ."
But we must take a brace and see it through . ''
All Rilla 's anger against Susan had evaporated .
"With Ken 's kiss still burning on her lips , and the wonderful significance of the promise he had asked thrilling heart and soul , she could not be angry with anyone ."
"She put her slim white hand into Susan 's brown , work-hardened one and gave it a squeeze ."
Susan was a faithful old dear and would lay down her life for any one of them .
"`` You are tired , Rilla dear , and had better go to bed , '' Susan said , patting her hand ."
`` I noticed you were too tired to talk tonight .
I am glad I came home in time to help you out .
It is very tiresome trying to entertain young men when you are not accustomed to it . ''
"Rilla carried Jims upstairs and went to bed , but not before she had sat for a long time at her window reconstructing her rainbow castle , with several added domes and turrets ."
"`` I wonder , '' she said to herself , `` if I am , or am not , engaged to Kenneth Ford . ''"
"CHAPTER XVII THE WEEKS WEAR BY Rilla read her first love letter in her Rainbow Valley fir-shadowed nook , and a girl 's first love letter , whatever blase , older people may think of it , is an event of tremendous importance in the teens ."
"After Kenneth 's regiment had left Kingsport there came a fortnight of dully-aching anxiety and when the congregation sang in Church on Sunday evenings , `` Oh , hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea , '' Rilla 's voice always failed her ; for with the words came a horribly vivid mind picture of a submarined ship sinking beneath pitiless waves amid the struggles and cries of drowning men ."
"Then word came that Kenneth 's regiment had arrived safely in England ; and now , at last , here was his letter ."
It began with something that made Rilla supremely happy for the moment and ended with a paragraph that crimsoned her cheeks with the wonder and thrill and delight of it .
"Between beginning and ending the letter was just such a jolly , newsy epistle as Ken might have written to anyone ; but for the sake of that beginning and ending Rilla slept with the letter under her pillow for weeks , sometimes waking in the night to slip her fingers under and just touch it , and looked with secret pity on other girls whose sweethearts could never have written them anything half so wonderful and exquisite ."
Kenneth was not the son of a famous novelist for nothing .
"He `` had a way '' of expressing things in a few poignant , significant words that seemed to suggest far more than they uttered , and never grew stale or flat or foolish with ever so many scores of readings ."
Rilla went home from Rainbow Valley as if she flew rather than walked .
But such moments of uplift were rare that autumn .
"To be sure , there was one day in September when great news came of a big Allied victory in the west and Susan ran out to hoist the flag -- the first time she had hoisted it since the Russian line broke and the last time she was to hoist it for many dismal moons ."
"`` Likely the Big Push has begun at last , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she exclaimed , `` and we will soon see the finish of the Huns ."
Our boys will be home by Christmas now .
Hurrah ! ''
"Susan was ashamed of herself for hurrahing the minute she had done it , and apologized meekly for such an outburst of juvenility ."
"`` But indeed , Mrs. Dr. dear , this good news has gone to my head after this awful summer of Russian slumps and Gallipoli setbacks . ''"
`` Good news ! ''
said Miss Oliver bitterly .
`` I wonder if the women whose men have been killed for it will call it good news .
Just because our own men are not on that part of the front we are rejoicing as if the victory had cost no lives . ''
"`` Now , Miss Oliver dear , do not take that view of it , '' deprecated Susan ."
`` We have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same .
"`` Quite lost , but I did not care , for I made up my mind that it would be best to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again ; and you see I have waited , '' said Mrs. Jo , beginning to pull in the big kite , for it was getting late ."
`` Must we go now ? ''
"`` I must , or you wo n't have any supper ; and that sort of surprise party would not suit you , I think , my chickens . ''"
`` Has n't our party been a nice one ? ''
"asked Tommy , complacently ."
`` Splendid ! ''
answered every one .
`` Do you know why ?
"It is because your guests have behaved themselves , and tried to make everything go well ."
"You understand what I mean , do n't you ? ''"
"`` Yes 'm , '' was all the boys said , but they stole a shamefaced look at one another , as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home , thinking of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves , and things had gone badly on account of it ."
"CHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN July had come , and haying begun ; the little gardens were doing finely and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours ."
"The house stood open from morning till night , and the lads lived out of doors , except at school time ."
"The lessons were short , and there were many holidays , for the Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise , and our short summers are best used in out-of-door work ."
"Such a rosy , sunburnt , hearty set as the boys became ; such appetites as they had ; such sturdy arms and legs , as outgrew jackets and trousers ; such laughing and racing all over the place ; such antics in house and barn ; such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale ; and such satisfaction in the hearts of the worthy Bhaers , as they saw their flock prospering in mind and body , I can not begin to describe ."
"Only one thing was needed to make them quite happy , and it came when they least expected it ."
"One balmy night when the little lads were in bed , the elder ones bathing down at the brook , and Mrs. Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor , he suddenly cried out , `` Oh , my Danny ! ''"
"and pointed to the window , where the moon shone brightly ."
"`` No , lovey , he is not there , it was the pretty moon , '' said his mother ."
"`` No , no , Danny at a window ; Teddy saw him , '' persisted baby , much excited ."
"`` It might have been , '' and Mrs. Bhaer hurried to the window , hoping it would prove true ."
"But the face was gone , and nowhere appeared any signs of a mortal boy ; she called his name , ran to the front door with Teddy in his little shirt , and made him call too , thinking the baby voice might have more effect than her own ."
"No one answered , nothing appeared , and they went back much disappointed ."
"Teddy would not be satisfied with the moon , and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask if Danny was not `` tummin ' soon . ''"
"By and by he fell asleep , the lads trooped up to bed , the house grew still , and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night ."
"Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing , for the big basket was always piled with socks , full of portentous holes , and thinking of the lost boy ."
"She had decided that baby had been mistaken , and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child 's fancy , for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed , and he was busy writing letters ."
It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house .
"As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps , something white caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn ."
"The children had been playing there all the afternoon , and , fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual , Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it ."
"But as she approached , she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief , but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it ."
"She hurried round the hay-cock , and there lay Dan , fast asleep ."
"It certainly was a pleasant place , airy , clean , and bright ."
"A hop-vine shook its green bells round the open window , the pretty aquarium stood in the middle of the room , with some delicate water plants rising above the water , and gold-fish showing their brightness as they floated to and fro below ."
On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to receive the curiosities yet to be found .
"Dan 's tall cabinet stood before the great door which was fastened up , while the small door was to be used ."
"On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol , very ugly , but very interesting ; old Mr. Laurence sent it , as well as a fine Chinese junk in full sail , which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle of the room ."
"Above , swinging in a loop , and looking as if she was alive , hung Polly , who died at an advanced age , had been carefully stuffed , and was no presented by Mrs. Jo ."
The walls were decorated with all sorts of things .
"A snake 's skin , a big wasp 's nest , a birch-bark canoe , a string of birds ' eggs , wreaths of gray moss from the South , and a bunch of cotton-pods ."
"The dead bats had a place , also a large turtle-shell , and an ostrich-egg proudly presented by Demi , who volunteered to explain these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked ."
"There were so many stones that it was impossible to accept them all , so only a few of the best were arranged among the shells on the shelves , the rest were piled up in corners , to be examined by Dan at his leisure ."
"Every one was eager to give something , even Silas , who sent home for a stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth ."
"It was rather moth-eaten and shabby , but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was fine , for the yellow glass eyes glared , and the mouth snarled so naturally , that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it , when he came bringing his most cherished treasure , one cocoon , to lay upon the shrine of science ."
`` Is n't it beautiful ?
I 'd no idea we had so many curious things .
I gave that ; do n't it look well ?
We might make a lot by charging something for letting folks see it . ''
Jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as the family viewed the room .
"`` This is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it I 'll paint out the name over the door , '' said Mr. Laurie , turning so quickly that Jack wished he had held his tongue ."
`` Hear !
hear ! ''
cried Mr. Bhaer .
`` Speech !
speech ! ''
added Mrs. Jo .
"`` Ca n't , I 'm too bashful ."
"You give them a lecture yourself you are used to it , '' Mr. Laurie answered , retreating towards the window , meaning to escape ."
"But she held him fast , and said , laughing as she looked at the dozen pairs of dirty hands about her , `` If I did lecture , it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of soap ."
"Come now , as the founder of the institution , you really ought to give us a few moral remarks , and we will applaud tremendously . ''"
"Seeing that there was no way of escaping , Mr. Laurie looked up at Polly hanging overhead , seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird , and sitting down upon the table , said , in his pleasant way , `` There is one thing I 'd like to suggest , boys , and that is , I want you to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this ."
"Just putting curious or pretty things here wo n't do it ; so suppose you read up about them , so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them , and understand the matter ."
"I used to like these things myself , and should enjoy hearing about them now , for I 've forgotten all I once knew ."
"It was n't much , was it , Jo ?"
Hook -RSB- .
Instant obedience was the only safe thing .
Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings .
"The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy 's suspicions , but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready , which , against her will , she was making for him out of some of Hook 's wickedest garments ."
"It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook 's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched , all but for the forefinger , which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook ."
"Instead of watching the ship , however , we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago ."
It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time ; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us .
"If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her , she would probably have cried , `` Do n't be silly ; what do I matter ?"
Do go back and keep an eye on the children . ''
So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them ; and they may lay to -LSB- bet on -RSB- that .
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home ; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening .
We are no more than servants .
"Why on earth should their beds be properly aired , seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry ?"
Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country ?
It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them ; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us .
"One thing I should like to do immensely , and that is to tell her , in the way authors have , that the children are coming back , that indeed they will be here on Thursday week ."
This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward .
"They have been planning it out on the ship : mother 's rapture , father 's shout of joy , Nana 's leap through the air to embrace them first , when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding ."
"How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance ; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth , and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly , `` Dash it all , here are those boys again . ''"
"However , we should get no thanks even for this ."
"We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time , and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure ."
"`` But , my dear madam , it is ten days till Thursday week ; so that by telling you what 's what , we can save you ten days of unhappiness . ''"
"`` Yes , but at what a cost !"
By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight . ''
"`` Oh , if you look at it in that way ! ''"
`` What other way is there in which to look at it ? ''
"You see , the woman had no proper spirit ."
"I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her ; but I despise her , and not one of them will I say now ."
"She does not really need to be told to have things ready , for they are ready ."
"All the beds are aired , and she never leaves the house , and observe , the window is open ."
"For all the use we are to her , we might well go back to the ship ."
"However , as we are here we may as well stay and look on ."
Sidney liked the letter and answered it .
Since then they had written to each other regularly .
"There was nothing sentimental , hinted at or implied , in the correspondence ."
"Whatever the faults of Sidney 's romantic visions were , they did not tend to precocious flirtation ."
"The Plainfield boys , attracted by her beauty and repelled by her indifference and aloofness , could have told that ."
"She never expected to meet John Lincoln , nor did she wish to do so ."
In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure .
"John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains , so alien and remote from snug , humdrum Plainfield life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the Bar N ."
"As for Sidney 's own letter , this is the way it read as she wrote it : `` The Evergreens , '' Plainfield ."
Dear Mr. Lincoln : The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon 's dance shall be yours tonight .
"I am sitting here in the library arrayed in my smartest , newest , whitest , silkiest gown , with a string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my throat -- the dear , glistening , sheeny things !"
And I am looking forward to the `` dances and delight '' of the evening with keen anticipation .
You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social functions .
"No , no , never !"
"I enjoy every one of them , every minute of them ."
"I love life and its bloom and brilliancy ; I love meeting new people ; I love the ripple of music , the hum of laughter and conversation ."
Every morning when I awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy .
The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady .
The thrill of it is in my veins yet .
"I distanced the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone , rocking along a dark , gleaming road , shadowy with tall firs and pines , whose balsam made all the air resinous around me ."
"Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk , and beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and rose where a soul might lose itself in colour ."
"On my right was the harbour , silvered over with a rising moon ."
"Oh , it was all glorious -- the clear air with its salt-sea tang , the aroma of the pines , the laughter of my friends behind me , the spring and rhythm of Lady 's grey satin body beneath me !"
"I wanted to ride on so forever , straight into the heart of the sunset ."
Then home and to dinner .
"We have a houseful of guests at present -- one of them an old statesman with a massive silver head , and eyes that have looked into people 's thoughts so long that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to yourself ."
"I was terribly in awe of him at first , but when I got acquainted with him I found him charming ."
He is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl .
"I sat by him at dinner , and he talked to me -- not nonsense , either , this time ."
He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles ; he was wise and witty and whimsical .
"I felt as if I were drinking some rare , stimulating mental wine ."
What a privilege it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes at the fascinating game of empire-building !
The scene must have been highly farcical . ''
"I thought myself it was a silly business , but I could not forget my father had a hand in it ."
"`` Surely , sir , it had some note of tragedy , '' said I. `` Why , no , sir , not at all , '' returned the lawyer ."
"`` For tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute , some dignus vindice nodus ; and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled , and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted ."
"However , that was not your father 's view ; and the end of it was , that from concession to concession on your father 's part , and from one height to another of squalling , sentimental selfishness upon your uncle 's , they came at last to drive a sort of bargain , from whose ill results you have recently been smarting ."
"The one man took the lady , the other the estate ."
"Now , Mr. David , they talk a great deal of charity and generosity ; but in this disputable state of life , I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer , and takes all the law allows him ."
"Anyhow , this piece of Quixotry on your father 's part , as it was unjust in itself , has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices ."
"Your father and mother lived and died poor folk ; you were poorly reared ; and in the meanwhile , what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws !"
And I might add -LRB- if it was a matter I cared much about -RRB- what a time for Mr. Ebenezer ! ''
"`` And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all , '' said I , `` that a man 's nature should thus change . ''"
"`` True , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
`` And yet I imagine it was natural enough .
He could not think that he had played a handsome part .
"Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder ; those who knew it not , seeing one brother disappear , and the other succeed in the estate , raised a cry of murder ; so that upon all sides he found himself evited ."
"Money was all he got by his bargain ; well , he came to think the more of money ."
"He was selfish when he was young , he is selfish now that he is old ; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself . ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` and in all this , what is my position ? ''"
"`` The estate is yours beyond a doubt , '' replied the lawyer ."
"`` It matters nothing what your father signed , you are the heir of entail ."
But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible ; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question .
"A lawsuit is always expensive , and a family lawsuit always scandalous ; besides which , if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out , we might find that we had burned our fingers ."
"The kidnapping , to be sure , would be a court card upon our side , if we could only prove it ."
"But it may be difficult to prove ; and my advice -LRB- upon the whole -RRB- is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle , perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century , and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision . ''"
"I told him I was very willing to be easy , and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse ."
In the meantime -LRB- thinking to myself -RRB- I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted .
"`` The great affair , '' I asked , `` is to bring home to him the kidnapping ? ''"
"`` Surely , '' said Mr. Rankeillor , `` and if possible , out of court ."
"For mark you here , Mr. David : we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who would swear to your reclusion ; but once they were in the box , we could no longer check their testimony , and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out ."
Which -LRB- from what you have let fall -RRB- I can not think to be desirable . ''
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` here is my way of it . ''"
And I opened my plot to him .
"Ned fell out of a tree , and split his jacket down the back , but suffered no other fracture ."
"Emil and Jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch , and while they were squabbling about it , Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes and fled to the protection of Dan , who was enjoying himself immensely ."
"The crutch was no longer necessary , and he was delighted to see how strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture , full of interesting rocks and stumps , with familiar little creatures in the grass , and well-known insects dancing in the air ."
"But of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which befell Nan and Rob was the most exciting , and it long remained one of the favorite histories of the household ."
"Having explored the country pretty generally , torn three rents in her frock , and scratched her face in a barberry-bush , Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big , black beads on the low , green bushes ."
"Her nimble fingers flew , but still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired , so she kept wandering here and there to search for better places , instead of picking contentedly and steadily as Daisy did ."
"Rob followed Nan , for her energy suited him better than his cousin 's patience , and he too was anxious to have the biggest and best berries for Marmar ."
"`` I keep putting 'em in , but it do n't fill up , and I 'm so tired , '' said Rob , pausing a moment to rest his short legs , and beginning to think huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it ; for the sun blazed , Nan skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper , and the berries fell out of his pail almost as fast as he put them in , because , in his struggles with the bushes , it was often upside-down ."
`` Last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great bouncers ; and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire .
"Let 's go and fill our things quick , and then hide in the cave and let the others find us , '' proposed Nan , thirsting for adventures ."
"Rob consented , and away they went , scrambling over the wall and running down the sloping fields on the other side , till they were hidden among the rocks and underbrush ."
"The berries were thick , and at last the pails were actually full ."
"It was shady and cool down there , and a little spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy cup ."
"`` Now we will go and rest in the cave , and eat our lunch , '' said Nan , well satisfied with her success so far ."
`` Do you know the way ? ''
asked Rob . ''
"` Course I do ; I 've been once , and I always remember ."
Did n't I go and get my box all right ? ''
"That convinced Rob , and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock and stone , and brought him , after much meandering , to a small recess in the rock , where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made ."
"`` Now , is n't it nice ? ''"
"asked Nan , as she took out a bit of bread-and-butter , rather damaged by being mixed up with nails , fishhooks , stones and other foreign substances , in the young lady 's pocket ."
`` Yes ; do you think they will find us soon ? ''
"asked Rob , who found the shadowy glen rather dull , and began to long for more society ."
"`` No , I do n't ; because if I hear them , I shall hide , and have fun making them find me . ''"
`` P'raps they wo n't come . ''
`` Do n't care ; I can get home myself . ''
`` Is it a great way ? ''
"asked Rob , looking at his little stubby boots , scratched and wet with his long wandering ."
"`` It 's six miles , I guess . ''"
"Nan 's ideas of distance were vague , and her faith in her own powers great ."
"`` I think we better go now , '' suggested Rob , presently ."
`` I sha n't till I have picked over my berries ; '' and Nan began what seemed to Rob an endless task .
"Jill had been winding wool for a stripe in her new afghan , and the green ball lay on her sofa ."
"These signs suggested and confirmed what Mrs. Minot did not want to believe ; so did the voice , attitude , and air of Jill , all very unlike her usual open , alert ways ."
"The kind lady could easily forgive the reading of her letter since the girl had found such sad news there , but the dangers of disobedience were serious in her case , and a glance showed that she was suffering either in mind or body -- perhaps both ."
`` I will wait for her to tell me .
"She is an honest child , and the truth will soon come out , '' thought Mrs. Minot , as she took a clean sheet , and Jill tried to study ."
"`` Shall I hear your lesson , dear ?"
"Jack means to recite his like a good boy , so suppose you follow his example , '' she said , presently ."
"`` I do n't know as I can say it , but I 'll try . ''"
"Jill did try , and got on bravely till she came to the word `` permanent ; '' there she hesitated , remembering where she saw it last ."
`` Do you know what that means ? ''
"asked her teacher , thinking to help her on by defining the word ."
`` Always -- for a great while -- or something like that ; does n't it ? ''
"faltered Jill , with a tight feeling in her throat , and the color coming up , as she tried to speak easily , yet felt so shame-stricken she could not ."
"`` Are you in pain , my child ?"
"Never mind the lesson ; tell me , and I 'll do something for you . ''"
"The kind words , the soft hand on her hot cheek , and the pity in the eyes that looked at her , were too much for Jill ."
"A sob came first , and then the truth , told with hidden face and tears that washed the blush away , and set free the honest little soul that could not hide its fault from such a friend ."
"`` I knew it all before , and was sure you would tell me , else you would not be the child I love and like to help so well . ''"
"Then , while she soothed Jill 's trouble , Mrs. Minot told her story and showed the letter , wishing to lessen , if possible , some part of the pain it had given ."
`` Sly old stamp !
"To go and tell on me when I meant to own up , and get some credit if I could , after being so mean and bad , '' said Jill , smiling through her tears when she saw the tell-tale witnesses against her ."
"`` You had better stick it in your book to remind you of the bad consequences of disobedience , then perhaps this lesson will leave a ` permanent ' impression on your mind and memory , '' answered Mrs. Minot , glad to see her natural gayety coming back , and hoping that she had forgotten the contents of the unfortunate letter ."
"But she had not ; and presently , when the sad affair had been talked over and forgiven , Jill asked , slowly , as she tried to put on a brave look , -- `` Please tell me about Lucinda Snow ."
"If I am to be like her , I might as well know how she managed to bear it so long . ''"
"`` I 'm sorry you ever heard of her , and yet perhaps it may help you to bear your trial , dear , which I hope will never be as heavy a one as hers ."
"This Lucinda I knew for years , and though at first I thought her fate the saddest that could be , I came at last to see how happy she was in spite of her affliction , how good and useful and beloved . ''"
"`` Why , how could she be ?"
What did she do ? ''
"cried Jill , forgetting her own troubles to look up with an open , eager face again ."
"`` She was so patient , other people were ashamed to complain of their small worries ; so cheerful , that her own great one grew lighter ; so industrious , that she made both money and friends by pretty things she worked and sold to her many visitors ."
"And , best of all , so wise and sweet that she seemed to get good out of everything , and make her poor room a sort of chapel where people went for comfort , counsel , and an example of a pious life ."
"So , you see , Lucinda was not so very miserable after all . ''"
"` Well , I was tired of stooping for the sticks , and was leaning against a tree to rest , when I heard a noise of ` sh - ` sh , among the dead leaves ."
"I thought perhaps it was a wolf , so I stood very still ."
But soon there came past a tall man -- oh !
"twice as tall as father -- with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle , from which hung a silver-handled knife ."
"Behind him followed a great dog , which looked stronger than any wolf , or even a bear ."
"But why are you so pale , mother ? '"
"` It was the Stalo , ' replied she , her voice trembling ; ` Stalo the man-eater !"
"You did well to hide , or you might never had come back ."
"But , remember that , though he is so tall and strong , he is very stupid , and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick . '"
"Not long after the mother and son had held this talk , it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one , no one knew whither ."
"The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief , to show him where they had passed , but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well , near which the children used to play ."
"The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen , and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well , and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there ."
"And , as he watched , Patto 's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path , till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place ."
"She slipped and fell , and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo ."
"As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage , and he vowed to have his revenge ."
"So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung , and putting it on went out into the forest ."
"When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him , then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well , though he took care to keep his head out of the water ."
"Very soon he heard a ` sh - ` sh of the leaves , and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner ."
"At the first glimpse of Patto 's head in the well he laughed loudly , crying : ` Ha !"
ha !
This time it is the old ass !
I wonder how he will taste ? '
"And drawing Patto out of the well , he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home ."
"Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast , while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut , which he meant to hold Patto 's flesh when it was cooked ."
"In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors , and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool ."
"The young man looked everywhere , but he could not find the axe , for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes ."
` Stupid fellow !
what is the use of you ? '
"grumbled his father angrily ; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool , but they had no better success than their brother . '"
"I must come myself , I suppose ! '"
"said Stalo , putting aside the box ."
"But , meanwhile , Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door , so that , as Stalo stepped in , his prisoner raised the axe , and with one blow the ogre 's head was rolling on the ground ."
When Sara was fifteen she had gone away to school .
Jeff had missed her sorely .
"For four years he saw her only in the summers , and each year she had seemed taller , statelier , further from him ."
"When she graduated her father took her abroad for two years ; then she came home , a lovely , high-bred girl , dimpling on the threshold of womanhood ; and Jeffrey Miller was face to face with two bitter facts ."
"One was that he loved her -- not with the boy-and-girl love of long ago , but with the love of a man for the one woman in the world ; and the other was that she was as far beyond his reach as one of those sunset stars of which she had always reminded him in her pure , clear-shining loveliness ."
"He looked these facts unflinchingly in the face until he had grown used to them , and then he laid down his course for himself ."
"He loved Sara -- and he did not wish to conquer his love , even if it had been possible ."
"It were better to love her , whom he could never win , than to love and be loved by any other woman ."
"His great office in life was to be her friend , humble and unexpectant ; to be at hand if she should need him for ever so trifling a service ; never to presume , always to be faithful ."
Sara had not forgotten her old friend .
"But their former comradeship was now impossible ; they could be friends , but never again companions ."
"Sara 's life was full and gay ; she had interests in which he had no share ; her social world was utterly apart from his ; she was of the hill and its traditions , he was of the valley and its people ."
"The democracy of childhood past , there was no common ground on which they might meet ."
Only one thing Jeffrey had found it impossible to contemplate calmly .
"Some day Sara would marry -- a man who was her equal , who sat at her father 's table as a guest ."
"In spite of himself , Jeffrey 's heart filled with hot rebellion at the thought ; it was like a desecration and a robbery ."
"But , as the years went by , this thing he dreaded did not happen ."
"Sara did not marry , although gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy of her ."
"She and Jeffrey were always friends , although they met but seldom ."
Sometimes she sent him a book ; it was his custom to search for the earliest mayflowers and take them to her ; once in a long while they met and talked of many things .
"Jeffrey 's calendar from year to year was red-lettered by these small happenings , of which nobody knew , or , knowing , would have cared ."
"So he and Sara drifted out of youth , together yet apart ."
"Her mother had died , and Sara was the gracious , stately mistress of Pinehurst , which grew quieter as the time went on ; the lovers ceased to come , and holiday friends grew few ; with the old colonel 's failing health the gaieties and lavish entertaining ceased ."
"Jeffrey thought that Sara must often be lonely , but she never said so ; she remained sweet , serene , calm-eyed , like the child he had met on the hill ."
"Only , now and then , Jeffrey fancied he saw a shadow on her face -- a shadow so faint and fleeting that only the eye of an unselfish , abiding love , made clear-sighted by patient years , could have seen it ."
"It hurt him , that shadow ; he would have given anything in his power to have banished it ."
And now this long friendship was to be broken .
Sara was going away .
"At first he had thought only of her pain , but now his own filled his heart ."
How could he live without her ?
How could he dwell in the valley knowing that she had gone from the hill ?
Never to see her light shine down on him through the northern gap in the pines at night !
"She was the cannibal of the seas , and scarce needed that watchful eye , for she floated immune in the horror of her name ."
"She was wrapped in the blanket of night , through which no sound from her could have reached the shore ."
"There was little sound , and none agreeable save the whir of the ship 's sewing machine at which Smee sat , ever industrious and obliging , the essence of the commonplace , pathetic Smee ."
"I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic , unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it ; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him , and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook 's tears and made it flow ."
"Of this , as of almost everything else , Smee was quite unconscious ."
"A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks , drinking in the miasma -LSB- putrid mist -RSB- of the night ; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards ; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck , where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook 's reach , lest he should claw them mechanically in passing ."
Hook trod the deck in thought .
O man unfathomable .
It was his hour of triumph .
"Peter had been removed for ever from his path , and all the other boys were in the brig , about to walk the plank ."
"It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel ; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man , could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily , bellied out by the winds of his success ?"
"But there was no elation in his gait , which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind ."
Hook was profoundly dejected .
He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night .
It was because he was so terribly alone .
This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs .
They were socially inferior to him .
Hook was not his true name .
"To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze ; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed , he had been at a famous public school ; and its traditions still clung to him like garments , with which indeed they are largely concerned ."
"Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled -LSB- attacked -RSB- her , and he still adhered in his walk to the school 's distinguished slouch ."
But above all he retained the passion for good form .
Good form !
"However much he may have degenerated , he still knew that this is all that really matters ."
"From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals , and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap , like hammering in the night when one can not sleep ."
`` Have you been good form to-day ? ''
was their eternal question .
"`` Fame , fame , that glittering bauble , it is mine , '' he cried ."
`` Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything ? ''
the tap-tap from his school replied .
"`` I am the only man whom Barbecue feared , '' he urged , `` and Flint feared Barbecue . ''"
"`` Barbecue , Flint -- what house ? ''"
came the cutting retort .
"cried Jack , ready to follow where his beloved friend led , and the others nodded , unwilling to be outdone by the youngest member ."
`` Good !
"With all of us to lend a hand , we can do a great deal ; and I tell you , boys , it is time , if we want to keep poor Bob straight ."
"We all turn our backs on him , so he loafs round the tavern , and goes with fellows we do n't care to know ."
"But he is n't bad yet , and we can keep him up , I 'm sure , if we just try ."
"I hope to get him into the Lodge , and that will be half the battle , wo n't it , Frank ? ''"
"added Ed , sure that this suggestion would have weight with the honorable Chairman ."
`` Bring him along ; I 'm with you ! ''
"answered Frank , making up his mind at once , for he had joined the Temperance Lodge four years ago , and already six boys had followed his example ."
"`` He is learning to smoke , but we 'll make him drop it before it leads to worse ."
"You can help him there , Admiral , if you only will , '' added Ed , giving a grateful look at one friend , and turning to the other ."
"`` I 'm your man ; '' and Gus looked as if he knew what he promised , for he had given up smoking to oblige his father , and kept his word like a hero ."
"`` You other fellows can do a good deal by just being kind and not twitting him with old scrapes , and I 'll do anything I can for you all to pay for this ; '' and Ed sat down with a beaming smile , feeling that his cause was won ."
"The vote was taken , and all hands went up , for even surly Joe gave in ; so Bob and Tom were duly elected , and proved their gratitude for the honor done them by becoming worthy members of the club ."
"It was only boys ' play now , but the kind heart and pure instincts of one lad showed the others how to lend a helping hand to a comrade in danger , and win him away from temptation to the safer pastimes of their more guarded lives ."
"Well pleased with themselves -- for every genuine act or word , no matter how trifling it seems , leaves a sweet and strengthening influence behind -- the members settled down to the debate , which was never very long , and often only an excuse for fun of all sorts ."
"`` Ralph , Gus , and Ed are for , and Brickbat , Grif , and Chick against , I suppose ? ''"
"said Frank , surveying his company like a general preparing for battle ."
"`` No , sir !"
I believe in co-everything ! ''
"cried Chick , a mild youth , who loyally escorted a chosen damsel home from school every day ."
"A laugh greeted this bold declaration , and Chick sat down , red but firm ."
"`` I 'll speak for two since the Chairman ca n't , and Jack wo n't go against those who pet him most to death , '' said Joe , who , not being a favorite with the girls , considered them a nuisance and lost no opportunity of telling them so ."
"`` Fire away , then , since you are up ; '' commanded Frank ."
"`` Well , '' began Joe , feeling too late how much he had undertaken , `` I do n't know a great deal about it , and I do n't care , but I do not believe in having girls at college ."
"They do n't belong there , nobody wants 'em , and they 'd better be at home darning their stockings . ''"
"`` Yours , too , '' put in Ralph , who had heard that argument so often he was tired of it ."
`` Of course ; that 's what girls are for .
"I do n't mind 'em at school , but I 'd just as soon they had a room to themselves ."
We should get on better . '' ''
"You would if Mabel was n't in your class and always ahead of you , '' observed Ed , whose friend was a fine scholar , and he very proud of the fact ."
"`` Look here , if you fellows keep interrupting , I wo n't sit down for half an hour , '' said Joe , well knowing that eloquence was not his gift , but bound to have his say out ."
After that he lay down and slept soundly .
"The sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot ."
"The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup , just as the book had said there would be ."
"He lifted the syrup out with a spoon , and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry , poured it into a small flask of crystal ."
"He next washed himself thoroughly , and dressed himself , in his best clothes , and putting the flask in his pocket , set out for the palace , and begged to see the king without delay ."
"Now Balancin , whose foot had been much less painful since Gilguerillo had wrapped it in the plaster , was counting the days to the young man 's return ; and when he was told Gilguerillo was there , ordered him to be admitted at once ."
"As he entered , the king raised himself eagerly on his pillows , but his face fell when he saw no signs of a slipper ."
"` You have failed , then ? '"
"he said , throwing up his hands in despair . '"
"I hope not , your majesty ; I think not , ' answered the youth ."
"And drawing the flask from his pocket , he poured two or three drops on the wound ."
"` Repeat this for three nights , and you will find yourself cured , ' said he ."
And before the king had time to thank him he had bowed himself out .
"Of course the news soon spread through the city , and men and women never tired of calling Gilguerillo an impostor , and prophesying that the end of the three days would see him in prison , if not on the scaffold ."
"But Gilguerillo paid no heed to their hard words , and no more did the king , who took care that no hand but his own should put on the healing balsam ."
On the fourth morning the king awoke and instantly stretched out his wounded foot that he might prove the truth or falsehood of Gilguerillo 's remedy .
"The wound was certainly cured on that side , but how about the other ?"
"Yes , that was cured also ; and not even a scar was left to show where it had been !"
Was ever any king so happy as Balancin when he satisfied himself of this ?
"Lightly as a deer he jumped from his bed , and began to turn head over heels and to perform all sorts of antics , so as to make sure that his foot was in truth as well as it looked ."
"And when he was quite tired he sent for his daughter , and bade the courtiers bring the lucky young man to his room ."
"` He is really young and handsome , ' said the princess to herself , heaving a sigh of relief that it was not some dreadful old man who had healed her father ; and while the king was announcing to his courtiers the wonderful cure that had been made , Diamantina was thinking that if Gilguerillo looked so well in his common dress , how much improved by the splendid garments of a king ' son ."
"However , she held her peace , and only watched with amusement when the courtiers , knowing there was no help for it , did homage and obeisance to the chemist 's boy ."
"Then they brought to Gilguerillo a magnificent tunic of green velvet bordered with gold , and a cap with three white plumes stuck in it ; and at the sight of him so arrayed , the princess fell in love with him in a moment ."
"The wedding was fixed to take place in eight days , and at the ball afterwards nobody danced so long or so lightly as king Balancin ."

Translated from the Danish by Mrs. Skavgaard-Pedersen . -RSB-
There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans .
From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship .
"So , one fine summer morning , he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back ."
"For many hours he trudged on merrily , now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree ."
"` Spare me a morsel , Ardan son of Gorla , ' asked a raven , fluttering down towards him ."
"` Seek food elsewhere , O bearer of ill-news , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ` it is but little I have for myself . '"
"And he stretched himself out for a few moments , then rose to his feet again ."
"On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests , and the brightness died out of the sky , and a darkness fell over the earth ."
"On and on , and on , till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it ."
"The door was opened and he entered , but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire , while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver ."
"` Welcome , fair youth , ' said the old man , turning his head ."
"` Sit down and warm yourself , and tell me how fares the outer world ."
It is long since I have seen it . '
"` All my news is that I am seeking service , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ' I have come from far since sunrise , and glad was I to see the rays of your lamp stream into the darkness . ' '"
"I need someone to herd my three dun cows , which are hornless , ' said the old man ."
"` If , for the space of a year , you can bring them back to me each evening before the sun sets , I will make you payment that will satisfy your soul . '"
But here the girl looked up and answered quickly : ` Ill will come of it if he listens to your offer . '
"` Counsel unsought is worth nothing , ' replied , rudely , Ardan son of Gorla ."
` It would be little indeed that I am fit for if I can not drive three cows out to pasture and keep them safe from the wolves that may come down from the mountains .
"Therefore , good father , I will take service with you at daybreak , and ask no payment till the new year dawns . '"
"Next morning the bell of the deer was not heard amongst the fern before the maiden with the hair of gold had milked the cows , and led them in front of the cottage where the old man and Ardan son of Gorla awaited them ."
"` Let them wander where they will , ' he said to his servant , ` and never seek to turn them from their way , for well they know the fields of good pasture ."
"But take heed to follow always behind them , and suffer nothing that you see , and nought that you hear , to draw you into leaving them ."
"Now go , and may wisdom go with you . '"
"As he ceased speaking he touched one of the cows on her forehead , and she stepped along the path , with the two others one on each side ."
"As he had been bidden , behind them came Ardan son of Gorla , rejoicing in his heart that work so easy had fallen to his lot ."
"At the year 's end , thought he , enough money would lie in his pocket to carry him into far countries where his sister might be , and , in the meanwhile , someone might come past who could give him tidings of her ."
"Thus he spoke to himself , when his eyes fell on a golden cock and a silver hen running swiftly along the grass in front of him ."
In a moment the words that the old man had uttered vanished from his mind and he gave chase .
"They were so near that he could almost seize their tails , yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air ."
"At length he could run no more , and stopped to breathe , while the cock and hen went on as before ."
"Then he remembered the cows , and , somewhat frightened , turned back to seek them ."
"Luckily they had not strayed far , and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass ."
"Ardan son of Gorla was sitting under a tree , when he beheld a staff of gold and a staff of silver doubling themselves in strange ways on the meadow in front of him , and starting up he hastened towards them ."
"He followed them till he was tired , but he could not catch them , though they seemed ever within his reach ."
"When at last he gave up the quest his knees trembled beneath him for very weariness , and glad was he to see a tree growing close by lade with fruits of different sorts , of which he ate greedily ."
`` We 'd like to have him .
"The little wagon is all ready for the girls ; you wo n't mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill , will you Aunty ? ''"
`` I should like it exceedingly ; but are you quite sure I shall not be in the way ? ''
"`` Oh , no , indeed !"
"we want you very much ; and the party will be spoilt if you do n't come , '' cried Demi , with great earnestness ."
"`` Thank you kindly , sir ; '' and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey , for she liked frolics as well as any of them ."
"`` Now , young ladies , we must not keep them waiting ; on with the hats , and let us be off at once ."
I 'm all impatience to know what the surprise is . ''
"As Mrs. Bhaer spoke every one bustled about , and in five minutes the three little girls and Teddy were packed into the `` clothes-basket , '' as they called the wicker wagon which Toby drew ."
"Demi walked at the head of the procession , and Mrs. Jo brought up the rear , escorted by Kit ."
"It was a most imposing party , I assure you , for Toby had a red feather-duster in his head , two remarkable flags waved over the carriage , Kit had a blue bow on his neck , which nearly drove him wild , Demi wore a nosegay of dandelions in his buttonhole , and Mrs. Jo carried the queer Japanese umbrella in honor of the occasion ."
"The girls had little flutters of excitement all the way ; and Teddy was so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard , and when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself , evidently feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the party ."
"When they came to the hill `` nothing was to be seen but the grass blowing in the wind , '' as the fairy books say , and the children looked disappointed ."
"But Demi said , in his most impressive manner , `` Now , you all get out and stand still , and the surprise party with come in ; '' with which remark he retired behind a rock , over which heads had been bobbing at intervals for the last half-hour ."
"A short pause of intense suspense , and then Nat , Demi , and Tommy marched forth , each bearing a new kite , which they presented to the three young ladies ."
"Shrieks of delight arose , but were silenced by the boys , who said , with faces brimful of merriment , `` That is n't all the surprise ; '' and , running behind the rock , again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size , on which was printed , in bright yellow letters , `` For Mother Bhaer . ''"
"`` We thought you 'd like one , too , because you were angry with us , and took the girls ' part , '' cried all three , shaking with laughter , for this part of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs. Jo ."
"She clapped her hands , and joined in the laugh , looking thoroughly tickled at the joke ."
"`` Now , boys , that is regularly splendid !"
Who did think of it ? ''
"she asked , receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did theirs ."
"`` Uncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others ; he said you 'd like it , so we made a bouncer , '' answered Demi , beaming with satisfaction at the success of the plot ."
`` Uncle Fritz knows what I like .
"Yes , these are magnificent kites , and we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours , were n't we , girls ? ''"
"`` That 's why we made them for you , '' cried Tommy , standing on his head as the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions ."
"`` Let us fly them , '' said energetic Nan ."
"`` I do n't know how , '' began Daisy ."
"`` We 'll show you , we want to ! ''"
"cried all the boys in a burst of devotion , as Demi took Daisy 's , Tommy Nan 's , and Nat , with difficulty , persuaded Bess to let go her little blue one ."
"`` Aunty , if you will wait a minute , we 'll pitch yours for you , '' said Demi , feeling that Mrs. Bhaer 's favor must not be lost again by any neglect of theirs ."
"`` Bless your buttons , dear , I know all about it ; and here is a boy who will toss up for me , '' added Mrs. Jo , as the professor peeped over the rock with a face full of fun ."
"He came out at once , tossed up the big kite , and Mrs. Jo ran off with it in fine style , while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle ."
`` Do n't quarrel about me .
"I shall do well enough , and the scarlet shawl will hide my ugly dress , '' said Merry , from the corner , where she sat waiting for her turn at the mirror ."
"As she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it , and something that she saw in the other room put her own disappointment out of her head ."
"Jill lay there all alone , rather tired with the lively chatter , and the effort it cost her not to repine at being shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting ."
"Her eyes were closed , her net was off , and all the pretty black curls lay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out , while the other rested on the red shawl , as if she loved its glowing color and soft texture ."
"She was humming to herself the little song of the dove and the donjon , and something in the plaintive voice , the solitary figure , went straight to Merry 's gentle heart ."
"`` Poor Jilly ca n't have any of the fun , '' was the first thought ; then came a second , that made Merry start and smile , and in a minute whisper so that all but Jill could hear her , `` Girls , I 'm not going to be the Princess ."
But I 've thought of a splendid one ! ''
`` Who ? ''
"asked the rest , staring at one another , much surprised by this sudden announcement ."
`` Hush !
"Speak low , or you will spoil it all ."
"Look in the Bird Room , and tell me if that is n't a prettier Princess than I could make ? ''"
"They all looked , but no one spoke , and Merry added , with sweet eagerness , `` It is the only thing poor Jill can be , and it would make her so happy ; Jack would like it , and it would please every one , I know ."
"Perhaps she will never walk again , so we ought to be very good to her , poor dear . ''"
"The last words , whispered with a little quiver in the voice , settled the matter better than hours of talking , for girls are tender-hearted creatures , and not one of these but would have gladly given all the pretty things she owned to see Jill dancing about well and strong again ."
"Like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched and brightened every face ; envy , impatience , vanity , and discontent flew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy , and with one accord they all cried , -- `` It will be lovely ; let us go and tell her ! ''"
"Forgetting their own adornment , out they trooped after Merry , who ran to the sofa , saying , with a smile which was reflected in all the other faces , `` Jill , dear , we have chosen another Princess , and I know you 'll like her . ''"
`` Who is it ? ''
"asked Jill , languidly , opening her eyes without the least suspicion of the truth ."
"`` I 'll show you ; '' and taking the cherished veil from her own head , Merry dropped it like a soft cloud over Jill ; Annette added the long plume , Susy laid the white silk dress about her , while Juliet and Mabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa , and Molly tore the last ornament from her turban , a silver star , to shine on Jill 's breast ."
"Then they all took hands and danced round the couch , singing , as they laughed at her astonishment , `` There she is !"
There she is !
Princess Jill as fine as you please !
`` Do you really mean it ?
But can I ?
Is it fair ?
How sweet of you !
Come here and let me hug you all ! ''
"cried Jill , in a rapture at the surprise , and the pretty way in which it was done ."
"The grand scene on the Twenty-second was very fine , indeed ; but the little tableau of that minute was infinitely better , though no one saw it , as Jill tried to gather them all in her arms , for that nosegay of girlish faces was the sweeter , because each one had sacrificed her own little vanity to please a friend , and her joy was reflected in the eyes that sparkled round the happy Princess ."
"`` Oh , you dear , kind things , to think of me and give me all your best clothes !"
"The other boys were flying around him now , flouting , scornful ; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently , his mind was no longer with them ; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago , or being sent up -LSB- to the headmaster -RSB- for good , or watching the wall-game from a famous wall ."
"And his shoes were right , and his waistcoat was right , and his tie was right , and his socks were right ."
"James Hook , thou not wholly unheroic figure , farewell ."
For we have come to his last moment .
"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised , he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea ."
He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him ; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him : a little mark of respect from us at the end .
"He had one last triumph , which I think we need not grudge him ."
"As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air , he invited him with a gesture to use his foot ."
It made Peter kick instead of stab .
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved .
"`` Bad form , '' he cried jeeringly , and went content to the crocodile ."
Thus perished James Hook .
"`` Seventeen , '' Slightly sang out ; but he was not quite correct in his figures ."
"Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night ; but two reached the shore : Starkey to be captured by the redskins , who made him nurse for all their papooses , a melancholy come-down for a pirate ; and Smee , who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles , making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas ."
Hook had feared .
"Wendy , of course , had stood by taking no part in the fight , though watching Peter with glistening eyes ; but now that all was over she became prominent again ."
"She praised them equally , and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one ; and then she took them into Hook 's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail ."
It said `` half-past one ! ''
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all .
"She got them to bed in the pirates ' bunks pretty quickly , you may be sure ; all but Peter , who strutted up and down on the deck , until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom ."
"He had one of his dreams that night , and cried in his sleep for a long time , and Wendy held him tightly ."
"Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps -LSB- legs -RSB- ; for there was a big sea running ; and Tootles , the bo ` sun , was among them , with a rope 's end in his hand and chewing tobacco ."
"They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee , shaved smartly , and tumbled up , with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers ."
It need not be said who was the captain .
Nibs and John were first and second mate .
There was a woman aboard .
"The rest were tars -LSB- sailors -RSB- before the mast , and lived in the fo ` c ` sle ."
"Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel ; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them ; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties , but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast , and if they snapped at him he would tear them ."
"The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood , and they cheered him lustily ."
"Then a few sharp orders were given , and they turned the ship round , and nosed her for the mainland ."
"Captain Pan calculated , after consulting the ship 's chart , that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June , after which it would save time to fly ."
"Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate ; but the captain treated them as dogs , and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin -LSB- one person after another , as they had to Cpt ."
"` Not large enough to draw attention , of course ; but it might come in handy . '"
And with another nod he left her .
The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast .
"He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track , and perceived that though the marks of wolves ' feet were many , not a single guest was to be seen anywhere ."
He knew very well what that meant ; but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid .
"The house door stood open , but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it ."
"However , he entered boldly , and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang , and the whole herd sprang at him , with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths ."
"Quick as they were they were too late , for the mink was already through the knot-hole and racing for his canoe ."
"The knot-hole was too small for the wolves , and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open ."
"Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and , once outside , aimed at the flying mink ; but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws , so they threw them away , and bounded to the shore , with all their speed , to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach ."
"Now , although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves , he had a good start , and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe ."
"They pushed off , but as they dipped the paddles into the water , they snapped as the bows had done , and were quite useless . '"
"I know where there are some new ones , ' cried a young fellow , leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach ."
"And the mink 's heart smote him when he heard , for he had not known of this secret store ."
"After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey , and the mink , seeing it was no good resisting any more , gave himself up ."
"Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands , which they always carried wound round their bodies , but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them ."
"` Why I could snap those in a moment , ' said he ; ` if you want to make sure that I can not escape , better take a line of kelp and bind me with that . '"
"` You are right , ' answered the grandfather ; ` your wisdom is greater than ours . '"
"And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line , as they had brought none with them ."
"` While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance , ' remarked the mink ."
"And the wolves replied : ` Very good , you may have your dance ; perhaps it may amuse us as well as you . '"
So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other .
"The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance , first in one canoe and then in the other ; and so graceful was he , that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death , and howled with pleasure ."
"` Pull the canoes a little apart ; they are too close for this new dance , ' he said , pausing for a moment ."
"And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs , sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both ."
"` Now nearer , now further apart , ' he would cry as the dance went on ."
` No !
further still . '
"And springing into the air , amidst howls of applause , he came down head-foremost , and dived to the bottom ."
"And through the wolves , whose howls had now changed into those of rage , sought him everywhere , they never found him , for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight , and then made his home in another forest ."
Adventures of an Indian Brave -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"A long , long way off , right away in the west of America , there once lived an old man who had one son ."
"It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins , but we were alarmed for his safety ."
"With the men in the temper they were in , it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again ."
We ran on deck .
"The pitch was bubbling in the seams ; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick ; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery , it was in that abominable anchorage ."
"The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each , hard by where the river runs in ."
One of them was whistling `` Lillibullero . ''
"Waiting was a strain , and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information ."
"The gigs had leaned to their right , but Hunter and I pulled straight in , in the direction of the stockade upon the chart ."
"The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance ; `` Lillibullero '' stopped off , and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do ."
"Had they gone and told Silver , all might have turned out differently ; but they had their orders , I suppose , and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to `` Lillibullero . ''"
"There was a slight bend in the coast , and I steered so as to put it between us ; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs ."
"I jumped out and came as near running as I durst , with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness ' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety ."
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade .
This was how it was : a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll .
"Well , on the knoll , and enclosing the spring , they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side ."
"All round this they had cleared a wide space , and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high , without door or opening , too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers ."
The people in the log-house had them in every way ; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges .
"All they wanted was a good watch and food ; for , short of a complete surprise , they might have held the place against a regiment ."
What particularly took my fancy was the spring .
"For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA , with plenty of arms and ammunition , and things to eat , and excellent wines , there had been one thing overlooked -- we had no water ."
I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death .
"I was not new to violent death -- I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland , and got a wound myself at Fontenoy -- but I know my pulse went dot and carry one ."
"`` Jim Hawkins is gone , '' was my first thought ."
"It is something to have been an old soldier , but more still to have been a doctor ."
There is no time to dilly-dally in our work .
"And so now I made up my mind instantly , and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat ."
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar .
"We made the water fly , and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner ."
"I found them all shaken , as was natural ."
"The squire was sitting down , as white as a sheet , thinking of the harm he had led us to , the good soul !"
And one of the six forecastle hands was little better .
"`` There 's a man , '' says Captain Smollett , nodding towards him , `` new to this work ."
` Then I sha n't be exactly a human ? '
Peter asked .
` No . '
` Nor exactly a bird ? '
` No . '
` What shall I be ? '
"` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , ' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once ; then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs ; and so it went on for ever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , ` Greedy !"
Greedy ! '
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
-LSB- Illustration : The birds on the island never got used to him .
His oddities tickled them every day -RSB- Peter wore no nightgown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
"To be easily pleased , for instance , and always to be really doing something , and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance ."
"Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests ; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon , and nearly as well as a blackbird , though never did he satisfy the finches , and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers ."
"He also became very learned in bird-lore , and knew an east wind from a west wind by its smell , and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks ."
But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart .
"All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests , and so , as they were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about , it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times -RSB- Peter 's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long , just as the birds sing for joy , but , being partly human , he needed an instrument , so he made a pipe of reeds , and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening , practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water , and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon , and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived , and they would say to each other , ` Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe ? '"
"And sometimes he played the birth of birds , and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg ."
"If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge , which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts , but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way ."
"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come , and the chestnut being so near , hears him and is cheated ."
"That is all we are , lookers-on ."
Nobody really wants us .
"So let us watch and say jaggy things , in the hope that some of them will hurt ."
The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there .
"When the children flew away , Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up , and that from first to last she had been wiser than he ."
"Of course , as we have seen , he was quite a simple man ; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off ; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion 's courage to do what seemed right to him ; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children , he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel ."
"To all Mrs. Darling 's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly : `` No , my own one , this is the place for me . ''"
In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back .
"Of course this was a pity ; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess , otherwise he soon gave up doing it ."
"And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling , as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways ."
Very touching was his deference to Nana .
"He would not let her come into the kennel , but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly ."
"Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab , which conveyed him to his office , and he returned home in the same way at six ."
Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours : this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention .
"Inwardly he must have suffered torture ; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home , and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside ."
"It may have been Quixotic , but it was magnificent ."
"Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out , and the great heart of the public was touched ."
"Crowds followed the cab , cheering it lustily ; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph ; interviews appeared in the better class of papers , and society invited him to dinner and added , `` Do come in the kennel . ''"
"On that eventful Thursday week , Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George 's return home ; a very sad-eyed woman ."
"Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days , all gone now just because she has lost her babes , I find I wo n't be able to say nasty things about her after all ."
"If she was too fond of her rubbishy children , she could n't help it ."
"Look at her in her chair , where she has fallen asleep ."
"The corner of her mouth , where one looks first , is almost withered up ."
Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there .
"Some like Peter best , and some like Wendy best , but I like her best ."
"Suppose , to make her happy , we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back ."
"They are really within two miles of the window now , and flying strong , but all we need whisper is that they are on the way ."
Let 's .
"It is a pity we did it , for she has started up , calling their names ; and there is no one in the room but Nana ."
"`` O Nana , I dreamt my dear ones had come back . ''"
"Nana had filmy eyes , but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress 's lap ; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back ."
"As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife , we see that his face is more worn than of yore , but has a softer expression ."
"The sun was by now low in the heavens , and the cows left off feeding , and turned their faces home again , followed by Ardan son of Gorla ."
"At the door of their stable the maiden stood awaiting them , and saying nought to their herd , she sat down and began to milk ."
"But it was not milk that flowed into her pail ; instead it was filled with a thin stream of water , and as she rose up from the last cow the old man appeared outside ."
"` Faithless one , you have betrayed your trust ! '"
he said to Ardan son of Gorla .
` Not even for one day could you keep true !
"Well , you shall have your reward at once , that others may take warning from you . '"
"And waving his wand he touched with it the chest of the youth , who became a pillar of stone ."
"Now Gorla of the Flocks and his wife were full of grief that they had lost a son as well as a daughter , for no tidings had come to them of Ardan their eldest born ."
"At length , when two years and two days had passed since the maiden had led her kids to feed on the mountain and had been seen no more , Ruais , second son of Gorla , rose up one morning , and said : ` Time is long without my sister and Ardan my brother ."
So I have vowed to seek them wherever they may be . '
And his father answered : ` Better it had been if you had first asked my consent and that of your mother ; but as you have vowed so must you do . '
"Then he bade his wife make a cake , but instead she made two , and offered Ruais his choice , as she had done to Ardan ."
"Like Ardan , Ruais chose the large , unblessed cake , and set forth on his way , doing always , though he knew it not , that which Ardan had done ; so , needless is it to tell what befell him till he too stood , a pillar of stone , on the hill behind the cottage , so that all men might see the fate that awaited those who broke their faith ."
"Another year and a day passed by , when Covan the Brown-haired , youngest son of Gorla of the Flocks , one morning spake to his parents , saying : ` It is more than three years since my sister left us ."
"My brothers have also gone , no one know whither , and of us four none remains but I. No , therefore , I long to seek them , and I pray you and my mother to place no hindrance in my way . '"
"And his father answered : ` Go , then , and take our blessing with you . '"
"So the wife of Gorla of the Flocks baked two cakes , one large and one small ; and Covan took the small one , and started on his quest ."
"In the wood he felt hungry , for he had walked far , and he sat down to eat ."
Suddenly a voice behind him cried : ' A bit for me !
a bit for me ! '
And looking round he beheld the black raven of the wilderness .
"` Yes , you shall have a bit , ' said Covan the Brown-haired ; and breaking off a piece he stretched it upwards to the raven , who ate it greedily ."
"Then Covan arose and went forward , till he saw the light from the cottage streaming before him , and glad was he , for night was at hand ."
"` Maybe I shall find some work there , ' he thought , ` and at least I shall gain money to help me in my search ; for who knows how far my sister and my brothers may have wandered ? '"
"The door stood open and he entered , and the old man gave him welcome , and the golden-haired maiden likewise ."
"As happened before , he was offered by the old man to herd his cows ; and , as she had done to his brothers , the maiden counselled him to leave such work alone ."
"But , instead of answering rudely , like both Ardan and Ruais , he thanked her , with courtesy , though he had no mind to heed her ; and he listened to the warnings and words of his new master ."
"Next day he set forth at dawn with the dun cows in front of him , and followed patiently wherever they might lead him ."
"On the way he saw the gold cock and silver hen , which ran even closer to him than they had done to his brothers ."
"Sorely tempted , he longed to give them chase ; but , remembering in time that he had been bidden to look neither to the right nor to the left , with a mighty effort he turned his eyes away ."
"Then the gold and silver staffs seemed to spring from the earth before him , but this time also he overcame ; and though the fruit from the magic tree almost touched his mouth , he brushed it aside and went steadily on ."
"` Well , but I do n't see how I am to get to you , ' said the Stalo , looking up and down ."
"` Jump over , as I did , ' answered Andras ; ` it is quite easy . '"
"` But I could not jump this river ; and I do n't know how you did , ' replied the Stalo . '"
"I should be ashamed to say such things , ' exclaimed Andras ."
"` Do you mean to tell me that a jump , which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of , is beyond your strength ? '"
"The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words , just as Andras meant him to do ."
He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river .
"Not that that would have mattered , for he was a good swimmer ; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries , and took aim at him ."
"His aim was good , but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet ."
"A second shot , directed at his forehead , fared no better , for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb ."
"Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo 's head , and when he sprang up , just an instant too soon , it hit him between the ribs ."
"Mortally wounded as he was , the Stalo was not yet dead , and managed to swim to the shore ."
"Stretching himself on the sand , he said slowly to Andras : ` Promise that you will give me an honourable burial , and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord , and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me ."
"My dog you must kill , but spare my son , Andras . '"
Then he died ; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy .
"The dog , a fierce , wicked-looking creature , he slew with one blow from his fist , for it is well known that if a Stalo 's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master 's wounds the Stalo comes to life again ."
"That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog ; but the bailiff , being only half a Stalo , had forgotten him , when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras ."
"Next , Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets , and bidding the boy get in , pushed it off from the shore , leaving the little craft to drift as it would , while he himself ran home ."
"With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer ; and he soon married a rich wife , whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor , and the two lived happy for ever after ."
"The White Slipper -LSB- From Lapplandische Mahrchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old .
And what a daughter !
"Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them ; and , as for the fathers , if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards ."
"Of course the king , whose name was Balancin , was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother ; indeed , he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love ."
"Now Diamantina , for that was her name , did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven ; but be the suitor who he might , the king always said him nay ."
"Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills , and more than one river flowed through ."
"Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset , attended by her ladies , and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms ."
"She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms , and a basket to put them in , so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly ."
"When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town , so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her , and telling her of their troubles ; and then she would seek out her father , and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it ."
But what has all this to do with the White Slipper ?
my readers will ask .
"Have patience , and you will see ."
"we 'll say hunting -- they found a little damsel lying on the snow , half dead with cold , they thought ."
"She was the child of a poor woman who lived in the forest -- a wild little thing , always dancing and singing about ; as hard to catch as a squirrel , and so fearless she would climb the highest trees , leap broad brooks , or jump off the steep rocks to show her courage ."
"The boys carried her home to the palace , and the queen was glad to have her ."
"She had fallen and hurt herself , so she lay in bed week after week , with her mother to take care of her -- '' `` That 's you , '' whispered Jack , throwing the white carnation at Jill , and she threw back the red one , with her finger on her lips , for the tale was very interesting now ."
"`` She did not suffer much after a time , but she scolded and cried , and could not be resigned , because she was a prisoner ."
"The queen tried to help her , but she could not do much ; the princes were kind , but they had their books and plays , and were away a good deal ."
"Some friends she had came often to see her , but still she beat her wings against the bars , like a wild bird in a cage , and soon her spirits were all gone , and it was sad to see her . ''"
`` Where was your Saint Lucy ?
"I thought it was about her , '' asked Jack , who did not like to have Jill 's past troubles dwelt upon , since his were not ."
`` She is coming .
"Saints are not born -- they are made after many trials and tribulations , '' answered his mother , looking at the fire as if it helped her to spin her little story ."
"`` Well , the poor child used to sing sometimes to while away the long hours -- sad songs mostly , and one among them which the queen taught her was ` Sweet Patience , Come . '"
"`` This she used to sing a great deal after a while , never dreaming that Patience was an angel who could hear and obey ."
"But it was so ; and one night , when the girl had lulled herself to sleep with that song , the angel came ."
"Nobody saw the lovely spirit with tender eyes , and a voice that was like balm ."
"No one heard the rustle of wings as she hovered over the little bed and touched the lips , the eyes , the hands of the sleeper , and then flew away , leaving three gifts behind ."
"The girl did not know why , but after that night the songs grew gayer , there seemed to be more sunshine everywhere her eyes looked , and her hands were never tired of helping others in various pretty , useful , or pleasant ways ."
"Slowly the wild bird ceased to beat against the bars , but sat in its cage and made music for all in the palace , till the queen could not do without it , the poor mother cheered up , and the princes called the girl their nightingale . ''"
`` Was that the miracle ? ''
"asked Jack , forgetting all about his slippers , as he watched Jill 's eyes brighten and the color come up in her white cheeks ."
"`` That was the miracle , and Patience can work far greater ones if you will let her . ''"
`` And the girl 's name was Lucy ? ''
"`` Yes ; they did not call her a saint then , but she was trying to be as cheerful as a certain good woman she had heard of , and so the queen had that name for her , though she did not let her know it for a long time . ''"
"`` That 's not bad for a Sunday story , but there might have been more about the princes , seems to me , '' was Frank 's criticism , as Jill lay very still , trying to hide her face behind the carnation , for she had no words to tell how touched and pleased she was to find that her little efforts to be good had been seen , remembered , and now rewarded in this way ."
`` There is more . ''
`` Then the story is n't done ? ''
cried Jack .
"`` Oh dear , no ; the most interesting things are to come , if you can wait for them . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , this is the moral part ."
"Now keep still , and let us have the rest , '' commanded Frank , while the others composed themselves for the sequel , suspecting that it was rather nice , because Mamma 's sober face changed , and her eyes laughed as they looked at the fire ."
"`` The elder prince was very fond of driving dragons , for the people of that country used these fiery monsters as horses . ''"
"`` And got run away with , did n't he ? ''"
"If this reformation goes on as it has begun , I shall soon feel like Dr. Blimber with his model young gentlemen , '' said Professor , laughing , as he saw Tommy not only remove his own hat , but knock off Ned 's also , as they entered the hall where the Princess was taking a ride on the rocking-horse , attended by Rob and Teddy astride of chairs , and playing gallant knights to the best of their ability ."
"`` You will never be a Blimber , Fritz , you could n't do it if you tried ; and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous hot-bed ."
No fear that they will be too elegant : American boys like liberty too well .
"But good manners they can not fail to have , if we give them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor , making it courteous and cordial , like yours , my dear old boy . ''"
`` Tut !
tut !
"we will not compliment ; for if I begin you will run away , and I have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end ; '' yet Mr. Bhaer looked pleased with the compliment , for it was true , and Mrs. Jo felt that she had received the best her husband could give her , by saying that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society ."
"`` To return to the children : I have just had another proof of Goldilocks ' good influence , '' said Mrs. Jo , drawing her chair nearer the sofa , where the Professor lay resting after a long day 's work in his various gardens ."
"`` Nan hates sewing , but for love of Bess has been toiling half the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our love-apples to her idol when she goes ."
"I praised her for it , and she said , in her quick way , ' I like to sew for other people ; it is stupid sewing for myself . '"
"I took the hint , and shall give her some little shirts and aprons for Mrs. Carney 's children ."
"She is so generous , she will sew her fingers sore for them , and I shall not have to make a task of it . ''"
"`` But needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment , my dear . ''"
`` Sorry for it .
"My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it , even if they give up the Latin , Algebra , and half-a-dozen ologies it is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over now-a-days ."
"Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman , but the dear 's mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already , and her mother has several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird without a bill , that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it . ''"
"`` I also have proof of the Princess 's power , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , after he had watched Mrs. Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole system of fashionable education ."
"`` Jack is so unwilling to be classed with Stuffy and Ned , as distasteful to Bess , that he came to me a little while ago , and asked me to touch his warts with caustic ."
"I have often proposed it , and he never would consent ; but now he bore the smart manfully , and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor , when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the story , and just then Stuffy came in to ask if he might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him ."
"`` She is not allowed to eat sweeties ; but if you like to give her the pretty box with the pink sugar-rose in it , she would like it very much , '' said Mrs. Jo , unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of self-denial , for the `` fat boy '' seldom offered to share his sugar-plums ."
`` Wo n't she eat it ?
"I should n't like to make her sick , '' said Stuffy , eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly , yet putting it into the box ."
"`` Oh , no , she wo n't touch it , if I tell her it is to look at , not to eat ."
"She will keep it for weeks , and never think of tasting it ."
Can you do as much ? ''
`` I should hope so !
"I 'm ever so much older than she is , '' cried Stuffy , indignantly ."
"`` Well , suppose we try ."
"Here , put your bonbons in this bag , and see how long you can keep them ."
"Let me count two hearts , four red fishes , three barley-sugar horses , nine almonds , and a dozen chocolate drops ."
Do you agree to that ? ''
"A glance showed that it was not the composition nor a note , but the beginning of a letter from Mrs. Minot to her sister , and Jill was about to lay it down when her own name caught her eye , and she could not resist reading it ."
"Hard words to write of one so young , doubly hard to read , and impossible to forget ."
"`` Dear Lizzie , -- Jack continues to do very well , and will soon be up again ."
But we begin to fear that the little girl is permanently injured in the back .
"She is here , and we do our best for her ; but I never look at her without thinking of Lucinda Snow , who , you remember , was bedridden for twenty years , owing to a fall at fifteen ."
"Poor little Janey does not know yet , and I hope '' -- There it ended , and `` poor little Janey 's '' punishment for disobedience began that instant ."
"She thought she was getting well because she did not suffer all the time , and every one spoke cheerfully about `` by and by . ''"
"Now she knew the truth , and shut her eyes with a shiver as she said , low , to herself , -- `` Twenty years !"
"I could n't bear it ; oh , I could n't bear it ! ''"
"A very miserable Jill lay on the floor , and for a while did not care who came and found her ; then the last words of the letter -- `` I hope '' -- seemed to shine across the blackness of the dreadful `` twenty years '' and cheer her up a bit , for despair never lives long in young hearts , and Jill was a brave child ."
"`` That is why Mammy sighs so when she dresses me , and every one is so good to me ."
"Perhaps Mrs. Minot does n't really know , after all ."
"She was dreadfully scared about Jack , and he is getting well ."
"I 'd like to ask Doctor , but he might find out about the letter ."
"Oh , dear , why did n't I keep still and let the horrid thing alone ! ''"
"As she thought that , Jill pushed the paper away , pulled herself up , and with much painful effort managed to get back to her sofa , where she laid herself down with a groan , feeling as if the twenty years had already passed over her since she tumbled off ."
"`` I 've told a lie , for I said I would n't stir ."
"I 've hurt my back , I 've done a mean thing , and I 've got paid for it ."
"A nice missionary I am ; I 'd better begin at home , as Mammy told me to ; '' and Jill groaned again , remembering her mother 's words ."
"`` Now I 've got another secret to keep all alone , for I 'd be ashamed to tell the girls ."
I guess I 'll turn round and study my spelling ; then no one will see my face . ''
"Jill looked the picture of a good , industrious child as she lay with her back to the large table , her book held so that nothing was to be seen but one cheek and a pair of lips moving busily ."
"Fortunately , it is difficult for little sinners to act a part , and , even if the face is hidden , something in the body seems to betray the internal remorse and shame ."
"Usually , Jill lay flat and still ; now her back was bent in a peculiar way as she leaned over her book , and one foot wagged nervously , while on the visible cheek was a Spanish stamp with a woman 's face looking through the black bars , very suggestively , if she had known it ."
"How long the minutes seemed till some one came , and what a queer little jump her heart gave when Mrs. Minot 's voice said , cheerfully , `` Jack is all right , and , I declare , so is Jill ."
"I really believe there is a telegraph still working somewhere between you two , and each knows what the other is about without words . ''"
"`` I did n't have any other book handy , so I thought I 'd study awhile , '' answered Jill , feeling that she deserved no praise for her seeming industry ."
"She cast a sidelong glance as she spoke , and seeing that Mrs. Minot was looking for the letter , hid her face and lay so still she could hear the rustle of the paper as it was taken from the floor ."
"It was well she did not also see the quick look the lady gave her as she turned the letter and found a red stamp sticking to the under side , for this unlucky little witness told the story ."
"Mrs. Minot remembered having seen the stamp lying close to the sofa when she left the room , for she had had half a mind to take it to Jack , but did not , thinking Frank 's plan had some advantages ."
"She also recollected that a paper flew off the table , but being in haste she had not stopped to see what it was ."
"Now , the stamp and the letter could hardly have come together without hands , for they lay a yard apart , and here , also , on the unwritten portion of the page , was the mark of a small green thumb ."
`` Tarry we no more . ''
"In the chancel they found Dick waiting , attended by a few young men ; and there were he and Joan united ."
"When they came forth again , happy and yet serious , into the frosty air and sunlight , the long files of the army were already winding forward up the road ; already the Duke of Gloucester 's banner was unfolded and began to move from before the abbey in a clump of spears ; and behind it , girt by steel-clad knights , the bold , black-hearted , and ambitious hunchback moved on towards his brief kingdom and his lasting infamy ."
"But the wedding party turned upon the other side , and sat down , with sober merriment , to breakfast ."
"The father cellarer attended on their wants , and sat with them at table ."
"Hamley , all jealousy forgotten , began to ply the nowise loth Alicia with courtship ."
"And there , amid the sounding of tuckets and the clash of armoured soldiery and horses continually moving forth , Dick and Joan sat side by side , tenderly held hands , and looked , with ever growing affection , in each other 's eyes ."
Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch passed them by .
They dwelt apart from alarms in the green forest where their love began .
"Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great prosperity and peace , and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine , in Tunstall hamlet ."
"One had been all his life a shipman , and continued to the last to lament his man Tom ."
"The other , who had been a bit of everything , turned in the end towards piety , and made a most religious death under the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey ."
"So Lawless had his will , and died a friar ."
"Footnotes : -LCB- 1 -RCB- At the date of this story , Richard Crookback could not have been created Duke of Gloucester ; but for clearness , with the reader 's leave , he shall so be called ."

_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___Treasure_Island.txt.out
"PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof ."
"I remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white ."
"I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
"in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars ."
"Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum ."
"This , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard ."
"`` This is a handy cove , '' says he at length ; `` and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop ."
"Much company , mate ? ''"
"My father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity ."
"`` Well , then , '' said he , `` this is the berth for me ."
"Here you , matey , '' he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; `` bring up alongside and help up my chest ."
"I 'll stay here a bit , '' he continued ."
"`` I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want , and that head up there for to watch ships off ."
What you mought call me ?
You mought call me captain .
"Oh , I see what you 're at -- there '' ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold ."
"What was good enough for his father was good enough for him , he used to say ."
"I hope it is not unfilial to say that I think he was wrong in that point of view , but I am not sure I go so far as to approve of aeroplanes , though they may be a military necessity ."
If the Almighty had meant us to fly he would have provided us with wings .
Since He did not it is plain He meant us to stick to the solid earth .
"At any rate , you will never see me , Mrs. Dr. dear , cavorting through the sky in an aeroplane . ''"
"`` But you wo n't refuse to cavort a bit in father 's new automobile when it comes , will you , Susan ? ''"
teased Rilla .
"`` I do not expect to trust my old bones in automobiles , either , '' retorted Susan ."
`` But I do not look upon them as some narrow-minded people do .
Whiskers-on-the-moon says the Government should be turned out of office for permitting them to run on the Island at all .
"He foams at the mouth , they tell me , when he sees one ."
"The other day he saw one coming along that narrow side-road by his wheatfield , and Whiskers bounded over the fence and stood right in the middle of the road , with his pitchfork ."
"The man in the machine was an agent of some kind , and Whiskers hates agents as much as he hates automobiles ."
"He made the car come to a halt , because there was not room to pass him on either side , and the agent could not actually run over him ."
"Then he raised his pitchfork and shouted , ` Get out of this with your devil-machine or I will run this pitchfork clean through you . '"
"And Mrs. Dr. dear , if you will believe me , that poor agent had to back his car clean out to the Lowbridge road , nearly a mile , Whiskers following him every step , shaking his pitchfork and bellowing insults ."
I 'll mind that when we come to clear accounts . ''
"And I believe he not only meant what he said , but would have done it ; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections ."
"But this is matter only for conjecture , things having gone otherwise than he forecast ."
"`` Keep her away a point , '' sings out Mr. Riach ."
`` Reef to windward ! ''
"And just at the same time the tide caught the brig , and threw the wind out of her sails ."
"She came round into the wind like a top , and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck , and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast ."
I was on my feet in a minute .
"The reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull , off a little isle they call Earraid , which lay low and black upon the larboard ."
"Sometimes the swell broke clean over us ; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef , so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces ; and what with the great noise of the sails , and the singing of the wind , and the flying of the spray in the moonlight , and the sense of danger , I think my head must have been partly turned , for I could scarcely understand the things I saw ."
"Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff , and , still in the same blank , ran over to assist them ; and as soon as I set my hand to work , my mind came clear again ."
"It was no very easy task , for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper , and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on ; but we all wrought like horses while we could ."
Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle and began to help ; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved .
The captain took no part .
It seemed he was struck stupid .
"He stood holding by the shrouds , talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock ."
"` Oh , heaven , help me ! '"
cried he .
` Cross !
cross ! '
answered a voice .
"The boy leapt for joy as he recognised the note of the owl of which the swallow had spoken , and he said softly in the bird 's language : ` Oh , wise owl , I pray you to protect and guide me , for I have come in search of the Bird of Truth ."
And first I must fill this far with the many-coloured water in the courtyard of the castle . '
"` Do not do that , ' answered the owl , ` but fill the jar from the spring which bubbles close by the fountain with the many-coloured water ."
"Afterwards , go into the aviary opposite the great door , but be careful not to touch any of the bright-plumaged birds contained in it , which will cry to you , each one , that he is the Bird of Truth ."
"Choose only a small white bird that is hidden in a corner , which the others try incessantly to kill , not knowing that it can not die ."
"And , be quick !"
"-- for at this very moment the giant has fallen asleep , and you have only a quarter of an hour to do everything . '"
"The boy ran as fast as he could and entered the courtyard , where he saw the two spring close together ."
"He passed by the many-coloured water without casting a glance at it , and filled the jar from the fountain whose water was clear and pure ."
"He next hastened to the aviary , and was almost deafened by the clamour that rose as he shut the door behind him ."
"Voices of peacocks , voices of ravens , voices of magpies , each claiming to be the Bird of Truth ."
"With steadfast face the boy walked by them all , to the corner , where , hemmed in by a hand of fierce crows , was the small white bird he sought ."
"Putting her safely in his breast , he passed out , followed by the screams of the birds of Bad Faith which he left behind him ."
"Once outside , he ran without stopping to the witch 's tower , and handed to the old woman the jar she had given him ."
` Become a parrot ! '
"cried she , flinging the water over him ."
"But instead of losing his shape , as so many had done before , he only grew ten times handsomer ; for the water was enchanted for good and not ill ."
"Then the creeping multitude around the witch hastened to roll themselves in the water , and stood up , human beings again ."
"When the witch saw what was happening , she took a broomstick and flew away ."
"Who can guess the delight of the sister at the sight of her brother , bearing the Bird of Truth ?"
"But although the boy had accomplished much , something very difficult yet remained , and that was how to carry the Bird of Truth to the king without her being seized by the wicked courtiers , who would be ruined by the discovery of their plot ."
"Soon -- no one knew how -- the news spread abroad that the Bird of Truth was hovering round the palace , and the courtiers made all sorts of preparations to hinder her reaching the king ."
"They got ready weapons that were sharpened , and weapons that were poisoned ; they sent for eagles and falcons to hunt her down , and constructed cages and boxes in which to shut her up if they were not able to kill her ."
They declared that her white plumage was really put on to hide her black feathers -- in fact there was nothing they did not do in order to prevent the king from seeing the bird or from paying attention to her words if he did .
"As often happens in these cases , the courtiers brought about that which they feared ."
"They talked so much about the Bird of Truth that at last the king heard of it , and expressed a wish to see her ."
"The more difficulties that were put in his way the stronger grew his desire , and in the end the king published a proclamation that whoever found the Bird of Truth should bring her to him without delay ."
"`` Better , sir . ''"
"`` Rather tired of the house , are n't you ? ''"
`` Guess I am ! ''
and Dan 's eyes roved away to the green hills and woods where he longed to be .
`` Suppose we take a little turn before the others come back ?
"That big , easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable , and a breath of fresh air will do you good ."
"Get a cushion and a shawl , Demi , and let 's carry Dan off . ''"
"The boys thought it a capital joke , and Dan looked delighted , but asked , with an unexpected burst of virtue , `` Will Mrs. Bhaer like it ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes ; we settled all that a minute ago . ''"
"`` You did n't say any thing about it , so I do n't see how you could , '' said Demi , inquisitively ."
"`` We have a way of sending messages to one another , without any words ."
It is a great improvement on the telegraph . ''
"`` I know it 's eyes ; I saw you lift your eyebrows , and nod toward the carriage , and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again , '' cried Nat , who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time ."
`` Right .
"Now them , come on , '' and in a minute Dan found himself settled in the carriage , his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite , nicely covered with a shawl , which fell down from the upper regions in a most mysterious manner , just when they wanted it ."
"Demi climbed up to the box beside Peter , the black coachman ."
"Nat sat next Dan in the place of honor , while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite , to take care of the foot , he said , but really that he might study the faces before him both so happy , yet so different , for Dan 's was square , and brown , and strong , while Nat 's was long , and fair , and rather weak , but very amiable with its mild eyes and good forehead ."
"`` By the way , I 've got a book somewhere here that you may like to see , '' said the oldest boy of the party , diving under the seat and producing a book which make Dan exclaim , `` Oh !"
"by George , is n't that a stunner ? ''"
"as he turned the leaves , and saw fine plates of butterflies , and birds , and every sort of interesting insect , colored like life ."
"He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks , but Mr. Laurie did not mind , and was quite satisfied to see the boy 's eager delight , and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as he came to them ."
"Nat leaned on his shoulder to look , and Demi turned his back to the horses , and let his feet dangle inside the carriage , so that he might join in the conversation ."
"When they got among the beetles , Mr. Laurie took a curious little object out of his vest-pocket , and laying it in the palm of his hand , said , `` There 's a beetle that is thousands of years old ; '' and then , while the lads examined the queer stone-bug , that looked so old and gray , he told them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy , after lying for ages in a famous tomb ."
"Finding them interested , he went on to tell about the Egyptians , and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them the Nile , and how he sailed up the mighty river , with the handsome dark men to work his boat ; how he shot alligators , saw wonderful beasts and birds ; and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel , who pitched him about like a ship in a storm ."
"`` Uncle Teddy tells stories ` most as well as Grandpa , '' said Demi , approvingly , when the tale was done , and the boys ' eyes asked for more ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Mr. Laurie , quite soberly , for he considered Demi 's praise worth having , for children are good critics in such cases , and to suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of ."
"`` Here 's another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was turning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan , '' and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrow-head and a string of wampum ."
`` Oh !
"tell about the Indians , '' cried Demi , who was fond of playing wigwam ."
"`` Dan knows lots about them , '' added Nat ."
"`` More than I do , I dare say ."
"Tell us something , '' and Mr. Laurie looked as interested as the other two ."
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as ` Slay her ! '
` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! '
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"` Anything except that , ' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies echoed , ` Anything except that . '"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her -- that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , ' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"` And it might melt , ' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"` Build a house round her , ' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation-stone , and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning-lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Queen Mab , who rules in the Gardens -RSB- The house was exactly the size of Maimie , and perfectly lovely ."
"One of her arms was extended , and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"` Now we fear it is quite finished , ' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"` That certainly finishes it , ' they said reluctantly ."
"` Not at all , ' cried a glow-worm ; ` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . '"
"` Wait one moment , ' said a china merchant , ` and I shall make you a saucer . '"
"I was so thinking when , upon a sudden , Mr. Rankeillor cried out , clapped his hand to his pockets , and began to laugh ."
"`` Why , '' he cries , `` if this be not a farcical adventure !"
"After all that I said , I have forgot my glasses ! ''"
"At that , of course , I understood the purpose of his anecdote , and knew that if he had left his spectacles at home , it had been done on purpose , so that he might have the benefit of Alan 's help without the awkwardness of recognising him ."
"And indeed it was well thought upon ; for now -LRB- suppose things to go the very worst -RRB- how could Rankeillor swear to my friend 's identity , or how be made to bear damaging evidence against myself ?"
"For all that , he had been a long while of finding out his want , and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through the town ; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well ."
"As soon as we were past the Hawes -LRB- where I recognised the landlord smoking his pipe in the door , and was amazed to see him look no older -RRB- Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march , walking behind with Torrance and sending me forward in the manner of a scout ."
"I went up the hill , whistling from time to time my Gaelic air ; and at length I had the pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush ."
"He was somewhat dashed in spirits , having passed a long day alone skulking in the county , and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas ."
"But at the mere sight of my clothes , he began to brighten up ; and as soon as I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I looked to him to play in what remained , he sprang into a new man ."
"`` And that is a very good notion of yours , '' says he ; `` and I dare to say that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than Alan Breck ."
"It is not a thing -LRB- mark ye -RRB- that any one could do , but takes a gentleman of penetration ."
"But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man will be somewhat wearying to see me , '' says Alan ."
"Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor , who came up alone and was presented to my friend , Mr. Thomson ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , I am pleased to meet you , '' said he ."
"`` But I have forgotten my glasses ; and our friend , Mr. David here '' -LRB- clapping me on the shoulder -RRB- , `` will tell you that I am little better than blind , and that you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow . ''"
"This he said , thinking that Alan would be pleased ; but the Highlandman 's vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that ."
"`` Why , sir , '' says he , stiffly , `` I would say it mattered the less as we are met here for a particular end , to see justice done to Mr. Balfour ; and by what I can see , not very likely to have much else in common ."
"But I accept your apology , which was a very proper one to make . ''"
"`` And that is more than I could look for , Mr. Thomson , '' said Rankeillor , heartily ."
"`` And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise , I think we should come into a nice agreement ; to which end , I propose that you should lend me your arm , for -LRB- what with the dusk and the want of my glasses -RRB- I am not very clear as to the path ; and as for you , Mr. David , you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with ."
"Only let me remind you , it 's quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or those of -- ahem -- Mr. Thomson . ''"
"Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk , and Torrance and I brought up the rear ."
Night was quite come when we came in view of the house of Shaws .
"Ten had been gone some time ; it was dark and mild , with a pleasant , rustling wind in the south-west that covered the sound of our approach ; and as we drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building ."
"It seemed my uncle was already in bed , which was indeed the best thing for our arrangements ."
"We made our last whispered consultations some fifty yards away ; and then the lawyer and Torrance and I crept quietly up and crouched down beside the corner of the house ; and as soon as we were in our places , Alan strode to the door without concealment and began to knock ."
"CHAPTER XXIX I COME INTO MY KINGDOM For some time Alan volleyed upon the door , and his knocking only roused the echoes of the house and neighbourhood ."
"At last , however , I could hear the noise of a window gently thrust up , and knew that my uncle had come to his observatory ."
"By what light there was , he would see Alan standing , like a dark shadow , on the steps ; the three witnesses were hidden quite out of his view ; so that there was nothing to alarm an honest man in his own house ."
"For all that , he studied his visitor awhile in silence , and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"The first year of the war had taught both sides a few truths, and especially that the war did not in any essential features resemble a straw-ride to camp-meeting and return. The South had also discovered that the Yankee peddlers could not be captured with fly-paper, and that although war was not their regular job they were willing to learn how it was done."
"In 1862 the national army numbered five hundred thousand men, and the Confederate army three hundred and fifty thousand. Three objects were decided upon by the Federal government for the Union army and navy to accomplish, viz., 1, the opening of the Mississippi; 2, the blockade of Southern ports; and 3, the capture of Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy."
"The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson was undertaken by General Grant, aided by Commodore Foote, and on February 6 a bombardment was opened with great success, reducing Fort Henry in one hour. The garrison got away because the land-forces had no idea the fort would yield so soon, and therefore could not get up there in time to cut off the retreat."
"Fort Donelson was next attacked, the garrison having been reinforced by the men from Fort Henry. The fight lasted four days, and on February 16 the fort, with fifteen thousand men, surrendered."
"Nashville was now easily occupied by Buell, and Columbus and Bowling Green were taken. The Confederates fell back to Corinth, where General Beauregard (Peter G. T.) and Albert Sidney Johnston massed their forces."
"General Grant now captured the Memphis and Charleston Railroad; but the Confederates decided to capture him before Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce him, should effect a junction with him. April 6 and 7, therefore, the battle of Shiloh occurred. Whether the Union troops were surprised or not at this battle, we cannot here pause to discuss."
"Suffice it to say that one of the Federal officers admitted to the author in 1879, while under the influence of koumys, that, though not strictly surprised, he believed he violated no confidence in saying that they were somewhat astonished."
"It was Sunday morning, and the Northern hordes were just considering whether they would take a bite of beans and go to church or remain in camp and get their laundry-work counted for Monday, when the Confederacy and some other men burst upon them with a fierce, rude yell. In a few moments the Federal troops had decided that there had sprung up a strong personal enmity on the part of the South, and that ill feeling had been engendered in some way."
"All that beautiful Sabbath-day they fought, the Federals yielding ground slowly and reluctantly till the bank of the river was reached and Grant's artillery commanded the position. Here a stand was made until Buell came up, and shortly afterwards the Confederates fell back; but they had captured the Yankee camp entire, and many a boy in blue lost the nice warm woollen pulse-warmers crocheted for him by his soul's idol. It is said that over thirty-five hundred needle-books and three thousand men were captured by the Confederates, also thirty flags and immense quantities of stores; but the Confederate commander, General A."
"S. Johnston, was killed. The following morning the tide had turned, and General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated unmolested to Corinth."
"General Halleck now took command, and, as the Confederates went away from there, he occupied Corinth, though still retaining his rooms at the Arlington Hotel in Washington."
"The Confederates who retreated from Columbus fell back to Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River, where Commodore Foote bombarded them for three weeks, thus purifying the air and making the enemy feel much better than at any previous time during the campaign. General Pope crossed the Mississippi, capturing the batteries in the rear of the island, and turning them on the enemy, who surrendered April 7, the day of the battle of Shiloh."
"May 10, the Union gun-boats moved down the river. Fort Pillow was abandoned by the Southern forces, and the Confederate flotilla was destroyed in front of Memphis. Kentucky and Tennessee were at last the property of the fierce hordes from the great coarse North."
"General Bragg was now at Chattanooga, Price at Iuka, and Van Dorn at Holly Springs. All these generals had guns, and were at enmity with the United States of America. They very much desired to break the Union line of investment extending from Memphis almost to Chattanooga."
"Bragg started out for the Ohio River, intending to cross it and capture the Middle States; but Buell heard of it and got there twenty-four hours ahead, wherefore Bragg abandoned his plans, as it flashed over him like a clap of thunder from a clear sky that he had no place to put the Middle States if he had them. He therefore escaped in the darkness, his wagon-trains sort of drawling over forty miles of road and ""hit a-rainin'."""
"September 19, General Price, who, with Van Dorn, had considered it a good time to attack Grant, who had sent many troops north to prevent Bragg's capture of North America, decided to retreat, and, General Rosecrans failing to cut him off, escaped, and was thus enabled to fight on other occasions."
"The two Confederate generals now decided to attack the Union forces at Corinth, which they did. They fought beautifully, especially the Texan and Missouri troops, who did some heroic work, but they were defeated and driven forty miles with heavy loss."
"October 30, General Buell was succeeded by General Rosecrans."
"The battle of Murfreesboro occurred December 31 and January 2. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the whole conflict, and must have made the men who brought on the war by act of Congress feel first-rate. About one-fourth of those engaged were killed."
"An attack on Vicksburg, in which Grant and Sherman were to co-operate, the former moving along the Mississippi Central Railroad and Sherman descending the river from Memphis, was disastrous, and the capture of Arkansas Post, January 11, 1863, closed the campaign of 1862 on the Father of Waters."
"General Price was driven out of Missouri by General Curtis, and had to stay in Arkansas quite a while, though he preferred a dryer climate."
"General Van Dorn now took command of these forces, numbering twenty thousand men, and at Pea Ridge, March 7 and 8, 1863, he was defeated to a remarkable degree. During his retreat he could hardly restrain his impatience."
"Some four or five thousand Indians joined the Confederates in this battle, but were so astonished at the cannon, and so shocked by the large decayed balls, as they called the shells, which came hurtling through the air, now and then hurting an Indian severely, that they went home before the exercises were more than half through. They were down on the programme for some fantastic and interesting tortures of Union prisoners, but when they got home to the reservation and had picked the briers out of themselves they said that war was about as barbarous a thing as they were ever to, and they went to bed early, leaving a call for 9.30 A.M. on the following day."
The red brother's style of warfare has an air about it that is unpopular now. A common stone stab-knife is a feeble thing to use against people who shoot a distance of eight miles with a gun that carries a forty-gallon caldron full of red-hot iron.
CHAPTER XXVI.
SOME MORE FRATRICIDAL STRIFE.
"The effort to open the Mississippi from the north was seconded by an expedition from the south, in which Captain David G. Farragut, commanding a fleet of forty vessels, co-operated with General Benjamin F. Butler, with the capture of New Orleans as the object."
"Mortar-boats covered with green branches for the purpose of fooling the enemy, as no one could tell at any distance at all whether these were or were not olive-branches, steamed up the river and bombarded Forts Jackson and St. Philip till the stunned catfish rose to the surface of the water to inquire, ""Why all this?"" and turned their pallid stomachs toward the soft Southern zenith. Sixteen thousand eight hundred shells were thrown into the two forts, but that did not capture New Orleans."
"Farragut now decided to run his fleet past the defences, and, desperate as the chances were, he started on April 24. A big cable stretched across the river suggested the idea that there was a hostile feeling among the New Orleans people. Five rafts and armed steamers met him, and the iron-plated ram Manassas extended to him a cordial welcome to a wide wet grave with a southern exposure."
"Farragut cut through the cable about three o'clock in the morning, practically destroyed the Confederate fleet, and steamed up to the city, which was at his mercy."
"“Nothing is wanting, not even a hair, Be sure the Devil himself is there.”"
"Then it was Jergli’s turn to speak,"
"“If it be not, it’s at least his mother, Or else it’s the Devil’s own step-brother.”"
"And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,"
"“Advance, Veitli, advance, advance, And I behind will hold the lance.”"
"Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,"
"“Tis Schulz’s place the first to be, No one deserves that honor but he.”"
"Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,"
"“Then let us boldly advance to the fight, And thus we shall show our valour and might.”"
"Hereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God’s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed “Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!” in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy."
"“Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there, The monster’s nothing but a hare!”"
"But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said “What? what?” in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, “Wade, wade through the water,” and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked “Wat, wat, wat.” The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, “Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?” So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again."
120 The Three Apprentices
"There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said, “What shall we do? We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate.” And that seemed best to the others also."
"They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were. “We are apprentices looking for work; Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate.” “There is no need for that,” said the man, “if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work; nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages!” One of them said, “If our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it.” “They will not,” replied the man, “I have no claim on you.” One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse’s foot and a man’s foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said, “Be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full.” As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer, “All three of us,” to every question; the second was to say, “For money,” and the third, “And quite right too!” They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied, “All three of us.” “Yes,” said the host, “that is what I mean.” The second said, “For money.” “Of course,” said the host. The third said, “And quite right too!”"
"“Certainly it is right,” said the host."
"Good meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, “All three of us,” the second said, “For money,”"
"and the third, “and quite right too!” “Indeed it is right,” said the host, “all three pay, and without money I can give nothing.” They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said, “These people must be mad.” “Yes, indeed they are,”"
"said the host, “they are not very wise.” So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but, “All three of us,” “For money,” and “And quite right too!” But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, “Sir host, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices who might steal it from me.” The host did as he was asked."
"As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said, “The three crazy apprentices have done this;” the lodgers confirmed it, and said, “It can have been no one else.” The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them, “Have you killed the merchant?” “All three of us,” said the first, “For money,” said the second; and the third added, “And quite right too!”"
"“There now, you hear,” said the host, “they confess it themselves.”"
"They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, “Bear it just one day longer, and do not play away your luck, not one hair of your head shall be hurt.”"
"The next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said, “Are you the murderers?” “All three of us.” “Why did you kill the merchant?”"
"“For money.” “You wicked wretches, you have no horror of your sins?”"
"“And quite right too!” “They have confessed, and are still stubborn,”"
"said the judge, “lead them to death instantly.” So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner’s men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman, “It is a pardon coming,” and “Pardon! pardon!” was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said, “You three are innocent; you may now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.” Then said the eldest, “We did not kill the merchant, the murderer is standing there in the circle,” and he pointed to the innkeeper. “In proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he has killed are still hanging.” Then the judge sent the executioner’s men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, “Now I have got the soul which I wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the rest of your lives.”"
121 The King’s Son Who Feared Nothing
"There was once a King’s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father’s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, “I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.” So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him. It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant’s playthings lying in the yard. These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man. After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it. The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins. “Little worm,” cried he, “why art thou playing with my balls? Who gave thee strength to do it?” The King’s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, “Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.” The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, “Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.” “What dost thou want with it?” said the King’s son. “I do not want the apple for myself,” answered the giant, “but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it. I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.” “I will soon find it,” said the King’s son, “and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.” The giant said, “Thou really believest it to be so easy! The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.” “They will be sure to let me in,” said the King’s son. “Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.” “That luck will be mine,” said the King’s son."
"Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden."
"The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep. Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden. There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches. He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple. The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins. When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master."
"The King’s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, “Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.” The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, “I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.” The giant said, “I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,” and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King’s son refused it. “Where the apple is, the ring must be also,” said the giant; “if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.”"
"They wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King’s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring. Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, “I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou. We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.” The King’s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river."
"On the third day, at one P.M., Lee opened with one hundred and fifty guns on Cemetery Ridge. The air was a hornet's nest of screaming shells with fiery tails. As it lulled a little, out of the woods came eighteen thousand men in battle-array extending over a mile in length. The Yankees knew a good thing when they saw it, and they paused to admire this beautiful gathering of foemen in whose veins there flowed the same blood as in their own, and whose ancestors had stood shoulder to shoulder with their own in a hundred battles for freedom."
"Their sentiment gave place to shouts of battle, and into the silent phalanx a hundred guns poured their red-hot messages of death. The golden grain was drenched with the blood of men no less brave because they were not victorious, and the rich fields of Pennsylvania drank with thirsty eagerness the warm blood of many a Southern son."
"Yet they moved onward. Volley after volley of musketry mowed them down, and the puny reaper in the neglected grain gave place to the grim reaper Death, all down that unwavering line of gray and brown."
"They marched up to the Union breastworks, bayoneted the gunners at their work, planted their flags on the parapets, and, while the Federals converged from every point to this, exploding powder burned the faces of these contending hosts, who, hand to hand, fought each other to death, while far-away widows and orphans multiplied to mourn through the coming years over this ghastly folly of civil war."
"Whole companies of the Confederates rushed as prisoners into the arms of their enemies, and the shattered remnant of the battered foe retreated from the field."
"While all this was going on in Pennsylvania, Pemberton was arranging terms of surrender at Vicksburg, and from this date onward the Confederacy began to wobble in its orbit, and the President of this ill-advised but bitterly punished scheme began to wish that he had been in Canada when the war broke out."
"In April of the same year Admiral Dupont, an able seaman with massive whiskers, decided to run the fortifications at Charleston with iron-clads, but the Charleston people thought they could run them themselves. So they drove him back after the sinking of the Kennebec and the serious injury of all the other vessels."
"General Gillmore then landed with troops. Fort Wagner was captured. The 54th Regiment of colored troops, the finest organized in the Free States, took a prominent part and fought with great coolness and bravery. By December there were fifty thousand colored troops enlisted, and before the war closed over two hundred thousand."
It is needless to say that this made the Yankee unpopular at the time in the best society of the South.
"General Gillmore attempted to capture Sumter, and did reduce it to a pulp, but when he went to gather it he was met by a garrison still concealed in the basement, and peppered with volleys of hot shingle-nails and other bric-à-brac, which forced him to retire with loss."
He said afterward that Fort Sumter was not desirable anyhow.
"This closed the most memorable year of the war, with the price of living at the South running up to eight hundred and nine hundred dollars per day, and currency depreciating so rapidly that one's salary had to be advanced every morning in order to keep pace with the price of mule-steaks."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
LAST YEAR OF THE DISAGREEABLE WAR.
"General Grant was now in command of all the Union troops, and in 1864-5 the plan of operation was to prevent the junction of the Confederates, General Grant seeking to interest the army in Virginia under General Lee, and General Sherman the army of General Joseph E."
Johnston in Georgia.
"Sherman started at once, and came upon Johnston located on almost impregnable hills all the way to Atlanta. The battles of Dalton, Resaca, Dallas, Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw Mountain preceded Johnston's retreat to the intrenchments of Atlanta, July 10, Sherman having been on the move since early in May, 1864."
"Jefferson Davis, disgusted with Johnston, placed Hood in command, who made three heroic attacks upon the Union troops, but was repulsed."
"Sherman now gathered fifteen days' rations from the neighbors, and, throwing his forces across Hood's line of supplies, compelled him to evacuate the city."
"The historian says that Sherman was entirely supplied from Nashville via railroad during this trip, but the author knows of his own personal knowledge that there were times when he got his fresh provisions along the road."
"This expedition cost the Union army thirty thousand men and the Confederates thirty-five thousand. Besides, Georgia was the Confederacy, so far as arms, grain, etc., were concerned. Sherman attributed much of his success to the fact that he could repair and operate the railroad so rapidly. Among his men were Yankee machinists and engineers, who were as necessary as courageous fighters."
"""We are held here during many priceless hours,"" said the general, ""because the enemy has spoiled this passenger engine. Who knows any thing about repairing an engine?"""
"""I do,"" said a dusty tramp in blue. ""I can repair this one in an hour."""
"""What makes you think so?"""
"""Well, I made it."""
This was one of the strong features of Sherman's army. Among the hundred thousand who composed it there were so many active brains and skilled hands that the toot of the engine caught the heels of the last echoing shout of the battle.
"Learning that Hood proposed to invade Tennessee, Sherman prepared to march across Georgia to the sea, and if necessary to tramp through the Atlantic States."
"Hood was sorry afterwards that he invaded Tennessee. He shut Thomas up in Nashville after a battle with Schofield, and kept the former in-doors for two weeks, when all of a sudden Thomas exclaimed, ""Air! air! give me air!"" and came out, throwing Hood into headlong flight, when the Union cavalry fell on his rear, followed by the infantry, and the forty thousand Confederates became a scattered and discouraged mob spread out over several counties."
"The burning of Atlanta preceded Sherman's march, and, though one of the saddest features of the war, was believed to be a military necessity."
Those who declare war hoping to have a summer's outing thereby may live to regret it for many bitter years.
"However, the suggestion was not acted on. The Colonial soldiers declined to put on a bright red coat and a pill-box cap, that kept falling off in battle, thus delaying the carnage, but preferred to wear homespun which was of a neutral shade, and shoot their enemy from behind stumps. They said it was all right to dress up for a muster, but they preferred their working-clothes for fighting. After the war a statistician made the estimate that nine per cent. of the British troops were shot while ascertaining if their caps were on straight.[4]"
"General Israel Putnam was known as the champion rough rider of his day, and once when hotly pursued rode down three flights of steps, which, added to the flight he made from the English soldiers, made four flights. Putnam knew not fear or cowardice, and his name even to-day is the synonyme for valor and heroism."
CHAPTER XV.
"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, LL.D., PH.G., F.R.S., ETC."
"It is considered advisable by the historian at this time to say a word regarding Dr. Franklin, our fellow-townsman, and a journalist who was the Charles A. Dana of his time."
"Franklin's memory will remain green when the names of the millionaires of to-day are forgotten. Coextensive with the name of E. Rosewater of the Omaha Bee we will find that of Benjamin Franklin, whose bust sits above the fireplace of the writer at this moment, while a large Etruscan hornet is making a phrenological examination of same."
But let us proceed to more fully mark out the life and labors of this remarkable man.
"Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child. If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's parents they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen pairs of them!"
"Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea, and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer."
"It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom."
"It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it would harden so that ""A Constant Reader"" or ""Veritas"" could be stabbed with it and die soon."
"Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with them."
"His paper was called the New England Courant. It was edited jointly by James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want."
"Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the other was in jail."
"In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad., put it off on ""our informant"" and go right along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side."
"How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?"
"At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to ""sub"" for a few weeks and then got a regular ""sit."""
"Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy."
He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would think he owned the paper.
"In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was then regarded as a great man, and almost every one took his paper."
"Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him."
"Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the Gazette office for examination."
"Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess."
"In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to where it was addressed."
"Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a great deal of attention."
"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, “Thou wilt never see thy father and mother again, but I will keep thee with me, for thou hast set me free, and I have compassion on thee. If thou dost all I bid thee, thou shalt fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.” He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said, “Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, thou shalt sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order.” The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, “What has happened to the well?” “Nothing, nothing,” he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said, “Thou hast dipped thy finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care thou dost not again let anything go in.” By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron John came, and already knew what had happened. “Thou hast let a hair fall into the well,” said he. “I will allow thee to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted, and thou canst no longer remain with me.”"
"On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said, “Take the handkerchief off.” Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. “Thou hast not stood the trial, and canst stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there thou wilt learn what poverty is. But as thou hast not a bad heart, and as I mean well by thee, there is one thing I will grant thee; if thou fallest into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, ‘Iron John,’ and then I will come and help thee. My power is great, greater than thou thinkest, and I have gold and silver in abundance.”"
"Then the King’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the King’s notice, and he said, “When thou comest to the royal table thou must take thy hat off.” He answered, “Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.” Then the King had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to turn him off at once."
"The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy."
"And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bed-room of the King’s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, “Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.” He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said, “How canst thou take the King’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.” “Oh, no,” replied the boy, “the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.” When he got into the room, the King’s daughter said, “Take thy cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.” He again said, “I may not, I have a sore head.” She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said, “I present them to thy children, they can play with them.” The following day the King’s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money."
"Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The King gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy, “I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.” The others laughed, and said, “Seek one for thyself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for thee.” When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jig, hobblety jig; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called “Iron John,”"
"three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said, “What dost thou desire?” “I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.” “That thou shalt have, and still more than thou askest for.” Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battle-field a great part of the King’s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by bye-ways back to the forest, and called forth Iron John. “What dost thou desire?” asked the wild man. “Take back thy horse and thy troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.” All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. “I am not the one who carried away the victory,” said he, “but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.” The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the King did not know, and said, “He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.” She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said, “He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, “Here comes our hobblety jig back again!”"
"They asked, too, “Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time?” He, however, said, “I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more ridiculed.”"
"The King said to his daughter, “I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and thou shalt throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown will come to it.” When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron John. “What dost thou desire?”"
"asked he. “That I may catch the King’s daughter’s golden apple.” “It is as safe as if thou hadst it already,” said Iron John. “Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.” When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one."
"The King’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away."
"On the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The King grew angry, and said, “That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.” He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him."
"On the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the King’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword."
"The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the King."
The following day the King’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy.
"“He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.”"
"The King had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the King’s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. “Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?” asked the King. “Yes,” answered he, “and here the apples are,” and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the King. “If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.” “If thou canst perform such deeds as that, thou art no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is thy father?” “My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.” “I well see,” said the King, “that I owe thanks to thee; can I do anything to please thee?” “Yes,” answered he, “that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.” The maiden laughed, and said, “He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,” and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, “I am Iron John, and was by enchantment a wild man, but thou hast set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be thy property.”"
137 The Three Black Princesses
"East India was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars. Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster. Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on the lake with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred dollars for him. So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became burgomaster. Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say, “Mr. Burgomaster,” should be put to death on the gallows."
"The son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on a high mountain. The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black."
"Then came three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black, but had a little white on their faces; they told him he was not to be afraid, they would not hurt him, and that he could deliver them. He said he would gladly do that, if he did but know how. At this, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would do so. When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he might go. He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat, and in a week he must be back there again."
"Then he was caught up, and was instantly in East India. He could no longer find his father in the fisherman’s hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that, or he would come to the gallows. Then he went to his father and said, “Fisherman, how hast thou got here?” Then the father said, “Thou must not say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, thou wouldst come to the gallows.” He, however, would not stop, and was brought to the gallows. When he was there, he said, “O, my masters, just give me leave to go to the old fisherman’s hut.” Then he put on his old smock-frock, and came back to the great men, and said, “Do ye not now see? Am I not the son of the poor fisherman? Did I not earn bread for my father and mother in this dress?” Hereupon his father knew him again, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then he related all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him who were black except a little white on their faces. And they had told him not to fear, and that he could deliver them. Then his mother said that might very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take a holy-water vessel with him, and drop some boiling water on their faces."
"He went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the water on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white."
"Then all the three princesses sprang up, and said, “Thou accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on thee! Now there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born who can set us free! We have still three brothers who are bound by seven chains they shall tear thee to pieces.” Then there was a loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the window, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth again, the mountain shut to again, and no one knew where the castle had stood."
138 Knoist and his Three Sons
"Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he had three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked. Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare. The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket. Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it. They all three got into the one with no bottom to it. Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree; in the tree was a mighty big chapel in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy-water with cudgels."
“How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run!”
139 The Maid of Brakel
"A girl from Brakel once went to St. Anne’s Chapel at the foot of the Hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and thought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,"
"“Oh, holy Saint Anne!"
Help me soon to a man.
"Thou know’st him right well, By Suttmer gate does he dwell, His hair it is golden, Thou know’st him right well.”"
"""Beware,"" continued the prince, ""lest you do that which afterwards you would give your life not to have done."""
"By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning, and he went away, after rewarding the man."
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
"He disguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the palace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested in him, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure her, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do something for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her to rise and go, for she was cured."
"In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because the queen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about it. At length some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by the place where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard this he was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This stern order, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the men and escaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of advice was true."
"Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and children. ""O fool,"" said he, ""what is the matter? If you laugh, why do you weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?"""
"""Do not bother me,"" said the potter. ""What does it matter to you?"""
"""Pardon me,"" said the prince, ""but I should like to know the reason."""
"""The reason is this, then,"" said the potter. ""The king of this country has a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her husbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the young men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called on soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing a potter's son marrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the marriage. What can we do?"""
"""Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,"" said the prince. ""I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to the princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and prepare me for the occasion."""
"So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince went to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess. ""Dread hour!"" thought he; ""am I to die like the scores of young men before me?"" He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay down on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what would happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him, intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the king came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter and the prince talking gaily together. ""Surely,"" said he, ""this man must be her husband, as he only can live with her."""
"""Where do you come from? Who are you?"" asked the king, entering the room."
"""O king!"" replied the prince, ""I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-such a country."""
"When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to abide in his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne."
"The prince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked permission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave him elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses of the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started."
"On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother-in-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival reached the ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck to do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at his palace, and to accept what little hospitality could be provided."
"Some of the sufferings of the Pilgrims at the time are depicted on the preceding pages by the artist, also a few they escaped."
"Looking over the lives of our forefathers who came from England, I am not surprised that, with all the English people who have recently come to this country, I have never seen a forefather."
[Footnote 2: See Dr. Dunn's Family Physician and Horse Doctor.]
CHAPTER V.
DRAWBACKS OF BEING A COLONIST.
"It was at this period in the history of our country that the colonists found themselves not only banished from all civilization, but compelled to fight an armed foe whose trade was war and whose music was the dying wail of a tortured enemy. Unhampered by the exhausting efforts of industry, the Indian, trained by centuries of war upon adjoining tribes, felt himself foot-loose and free to shoot the unprotected forefather from behind the very stump fence his victim had worked so hard to erect."
"King Philip, a demonetized sovereign, organized his red troops, and, carrying no haversacks, knapsacks, or artillery, fell upon the colonists and killed them, only to reappear at some remote point while the dead and wounded who fell at the first point were being buried or cared for by rude physicians."
"What an era in the history of a country! Gentlewomen whose homes had been in the peaceful hamlets of England lived and died in the face of a cruel foe, yet prepared the cloth and clothing for their families, fed them, and taught them to look to God in all times of trouble, to be prayerful in their daily lives, yet vigilant and ready to deal death to the general enemy. They were the mothers whose sons and grandsons laid the huge foundations of a great nation and cemented them with their blood."
At this time there was a line of battle three hundred miles in length.
"On one side the white man went armed to the field or the prayer-meeting, shooting an Indian on sight as he would a panther; on the other, a foe whose wife did the chores and hoed the scattering crops while he made war and extermination his joy by night and his prayer and life-long purpose by day."
"Finally, however, the victory came sluggishly to the brave and deserving. One thousand Indians were killed at one pop, and their wigwams were burned. All their furniture and curios were burned in their wigwams, and some of their valuable dogs were holocausted. King Philip was shot by a follower as he was looking under the throne for something, and peace was for the time declared."
"About 1684 the Colony of Massachusetts, which had dared to open up a trade with the West Indies, using its own vessels for that purpose, was hauled over the coals by the mother-country for violation of the Navigation Act, and an officer sent over to enforce the latter. The colonists defied him, and when he was speaking to them publicly in a tone of reprimand, he got an ovation in the way of eggs and codfish, both of which had been set aside for that purpose when the country was new, and therefore had an air of antiquity which cannot be successfully imitated."
"As a result, the Colony was made a royal appendage, and Sir Edmund Andros, a political hack under James II., was made Governor of New England. He reigned under great difficulties for three years, and then suddenly found himself in jail. The jail was so arranged that he could not get out, and so the Puritans now quietly resumed their old form of government."
"This continued also for three years, when Sir William Phipps became Governor under the crown, with one hundred and twenty pounds per annum and house-rent."
"But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear: ""How can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some new artifice."" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman, ""Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do you great honour to-day."" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of ""Froggie"" which his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out: ""This is a fine pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless self."" The people there, when they heard him say that, raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the object presented to him, and murmured, ""Ah! a great sage, he knows even about the frog!"" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world."
The Charmed Ring
"A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill."
"""Please do not kill the dog,"" pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Then and there, of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog, and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. ""Oh!"
"please do not kill it,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money."
"He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but others did not. ""Please do not kill the snake,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees."" Of course the people agreed, and were highly delighted."
What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went home.
"""You fool! You scamp!"" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. ""Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my house."""
"So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head, and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its tail on the other."
"One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, ""I am the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's preserver!"""
"""Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,"" said the young man."
"""Well said!"" continued the snake. ""Do you see yonder mountain? At the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's country. Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too. But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and spoon which you possess.' With these in your possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of the rarest and most delicious foods."""
"Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. ""O master!"""
"exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do."
"""What shall we do? Where shall we go?"""
"""Wait for me here,"" he replied. ""I am not going far. I shall not be long away."" On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to sight."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the dog to the cat."
"""We must remain here,"" replied the cat, ""as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food. I will go to the people's houses and get plenty of food for both of us."" And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till their master came again and joined them."
"The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja's right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness's gratitude to him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the top of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting for him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and pot and spoon."
"The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for several years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his father, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir. At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the beautiful woman for his son's wife."
"She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful princess and said, ""I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before, because I left the country just after your birth."" She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress thought to herself, ""I shall soon accomplish my errand."" When she had been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring, and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring, and he readily gave it to her."
"The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of death. ""Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,"" she said to him. ""The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm, whereby you may bring her before you."" The prince was almost mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her."
"Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only, just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. ""O master!"" they said, ""stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your wife and house."""
"""Go,"" said he, ""and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my wife, and I shall live."""
"So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken."
"""We may have some difficulty here,"" said the cat. ""Look, the king has taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go to the house and try to see her."" So the dog sat down, and the cat climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them."
"""But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?"" she asked."
"""Yes,"" replied the cat, ""if you can tell me where the charmed ring is."""
"""The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,"" she said."
"""All right,"" said the cat, ""I will recover it. If we once get it, everything is ours."" Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down."
"The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and pounced down on him. ""Oh! let me go, let me go,"" cried the terrified rat. ""Oh! let him go,"" squealed all the company. ""It is his wedding day."""
"""No, no,"" replied the cat. ""Not unless you do something for me."
"Jackson was unfriendly to the Bank of the United States, and the bank retaliated by contracting its loans, thus making money-matters hard to get hold of by the masses."
"""When the public money,"" says the historian, ""which had been withdrawn from the Bank of the United States was deposited in local banks, money was easy and speculation extended to every branch of trade. New cities were laid out; fabulous prices were charged for building-lots which existed only on paper"" etc. And in Van Buren's time the people paid the violinist, as they have in 1893, with ruin and remorse."
Speculation which is unprofitable should never be encouraged.
"Unprofitable speculation is only another term for idiocy. But, on the other hand, profitable speculation leads to prosperity, public esteem, and the ability to keep a team. We may distinguish the one from the other by means of ascertaining the difference between them. If one finds on waking up in the morning that he experiences a sensation of being in the poor-house, he may almost at once jump to the conclusion that the kind of speculation he selected was the wrong one."
The Black Hawk War occurred in the Northwest Territory in 1832. It grew out of the fact that the Sacs and Foxes sold their lands to the United States and afterwards regretted that they had not asked more for them:
"so they refused to vacate, until several of them had been used up on the asparagus-beds of the husbandman."
"The Florida War (1835) grew out of the fact that the Seminoles regretted having made a dicker with the government at too low a price for land. Osceola, the chief, regretted the matter so much that he scalped General Thompson while the latter was at dinner, which shows that the Indian is not susceptible to cultivation or the acquisition of any knowledge of table etiquette whatever. What could be in poorer taste than scalping a man between the soup and the remove? The same day Major Dade with one hundred men was waylaid, and all but four of the party killed."
Seven years later the Indians were subdued.
"Phrenologically the Indian allows his alimentiveness to overbalance his group of organs which show veneration, benevolence, fondness for society, fêtes champêtres, etc., hope, love of study, fondness for agriculture, an unbridled passion for toil, etc."
"France owed five million dollars for damages to our commerce in Napoleon's wars, and, Napoleon himself being entirely worthless, having said every time that the bill was presented that he would settle it as soon as he got back from St. Helena, Jackson ordered reprisals to be made, but England acted as a peacemaker, and the bill was paid. On receiving the money a trunk attached by our government and belonging to Napoleon was released."
"Space here, and the nature of this work, forbid an extended opinion regarding the course pursued by Napoleon in this matter. His tomb is in the basement of the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, and you are requested not to fumer while you are there."
CHAPTER XXII.
MORE DIFFICULTIES STRAIGHTENED OUT.
"Van Buren, the eighth President, was unfortunate in taking the helm as the financial cyclone struck the country. This was brought about by scarcity of funds more than anything else. Business-men would not pay their debts, and, though New York was not then so large as at present, one hundred million dollars were lost in sixty days in this way."
"The government had required the payments for public lands to be made in coin, and so the Treasury had plenty of gold and silver, while business had nothing to work with. Speculation also had made a good many snobs who had sent their gold and silver abroad for foreign luxuries, also some paupers who could not do so. When a man made some money from the sale of rural lots he had his hats made abroad, and his wife had her dresses fitted in Paris at great expense. Confidence was destroyed, and the air was heavy with failures and apprehension of more failures to come."
"The Canadians rebelled against England, and many of our people wanted to unite with Canada against the mother-country, but the police would not permit them to do so. General Scott was sent to the frontier to keep our people from aiding the Canadians."
"There was trouble in the Northeast over the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, but it was settled by the commissioners, Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton. Webster was a smart man and a good extemporaneous speaker."
"Van Buren failed of a re-election, as the people did not fully endorse his administration. Administrations are not generally endorsed where the people are unable to get over six pounds of sugar for a dollar."
"General Harrison, who followed in 1841, died soon after choosing his Cabinet, and his Vice-President, John Tyler, elected as a Whig, proceeded to act as President, but not as a Whig President should. His party passed a bill establishing the United States Bank, but Tyler vetoed it, and the men who elected him wished they had been as dead as Rameses was at the time."
"Dorr's justly celebrated rebellion in Rhode Island was an outbreak resulting from restricting the right of suffrage to those who owned property. A new Constitution was adopted, and Dorr chosen as Governor."
"He was not recognized, and so tried to capture the seat while the regular governor was at tea. He got into jail for life, but was afterwards pardoned out and embraced the Christian religion."
"In 1844 the Anti-Rent War in the State of New York broke out among those who were tenants of the old ""Patroon Estates."" These men, disguised as Indians, tarred and feathered those who paid rent, and killed the collectors who were sent to them. In 1846 the matter was settled by the military."
"In 1840 the Mormons had settled at Nauvoo, Illinois. They were led by Joseph Smith, and not only proposed to run a new kind of religion, but introduced polygamy into it. The people who lived near them attacked them, killed Smith, and drove the Mormons to Iowa, opposite Omaha."
"In 1844 occurred the building of the magnetic telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. The line was from Baltimore to Washington, or vice versa, authorities failing to agree on this matter. It cost thirty thousand dollars, and the boys who delivered the messages made more out of it then than the stockholders did."
"Fulton having invented and perfected the steamboat in 1805 and started the Clermont on the North River at the dizzy rate of five miles per hour, and George Stephenson having in 1814 made the first locomotive to run on a track, the people began to feel that theosophy was about all they needed to place them on a level with the seraphim and other astral bodies."
"Texas had, under the guidance of Sam Houston, obtained her independence from Mexico, and asked for admission to the Union. Congress at first rejected her, fearing that the Texas people lacked cultivation, being so far away from the thought-ganglia of the East, also fearing a war with Mexico; but she was at last admitted, and now every one is glad of it."
"The Whigs were not in favor of the admission of Texas, and made that the issue of the following campaign, Henry Clay leading his party to a hospitable grave in the fall. James K. Polk, a Democrat, was elected."
"asked the peasant. “Oh, I have not got the money,” replied the woman; “he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.” “What kind of security?” asked the man. “One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two. I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least.” The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her. Suddenly he let the stick fail and said, “You are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God’s earth, but I am sorry for you. I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you. If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount.”"
"He went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen. Then he saw a peasant’s waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them. The man thought to himself, “That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of,” and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise. “What do you want, my friend?” said the woman to him; “I don’t know you, where do you come from?” “I have fallen down from heaven,”"
"replied the man, “and don’t know how to get back again, couldn’t you drive me up?” “No,” said the woman, “I don’t know the way, but if you come from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband, who has been there these three years is. You must have seen him?” “Oh, yes, I have seen him, but all men can’t get on well. He keeps sheep, and the sheep give him a great deal to do. They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run after them and drive them together again. His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body. There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won’t let any of them in, as you know by the story.” “Who would have thought it?”"
"cried the woman, “I tell you what, I will fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at home in the cupboard, he can wear that and look respectable. You will be so kind as to take it with you.” “That won’t do very well,” answered the peasant; “people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven, they are taken away from one at the gate.” “Then hark you,” said the woman, “I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it, I will send that to him. If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have it.” “If you can’t manage it any other way,” said the peasant, “I will do you that favor.”"
"“Just sit still where you are,” said she, “and I will drive home and fetch the purse, I shall soon be back again. I do not sit down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it lighter for the cattle.” She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, “That woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really brings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no beating.” It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket. Before she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy."
"When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field. She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, “I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?” The son was full of astonishment. “Mother,” said he, “it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.” He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse. “Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?” cried the youth to him. “Yes,”"
"answered the peasant, “he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.” “Alas,” said the youth, “I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.” “Aha!” thought the peasant, “here is another who has no wick in his lamp!” “Why should I not do you this favor?” said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot. The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back. “The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,” thought he, “and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.” He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about."
"“Thou hast done well,” answered she, “thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.”"
"When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, “Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.” Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather’s chair, and said, “It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.” So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks."
105 Stories about Snakes
First Story.
"There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yard with it. When she began to eat however, a snake came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate with her. The child had pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and the snake did not come at once, she cried,"
"“Snake, snake, come swiftly Hither come, thou tiny thing, Thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread, Thou shalt refresh thyself with milk.”"
"Then the snake came in haste, and enjoyed its food. Moreover it showed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings. The snake, however, only drank the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone."
"Then one day the child took its little spoon and struck the snake gently on its head with it, and said, “Eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing.” The mother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she saw that she was striking a snake with her spoon, ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature."
"From that time forth, a change came over the child. As long as the snake had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away. It was not long before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral garland, and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier."
Second Story.
"An orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning, when she saw a snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall. Swiftly she spread out beside this one of the blue silk handkerchiefs which snakes have such a strong liking for, and which are the only things they will creep on. As soon as the snake saw it, it went back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again. The girl took up the crown, it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work. It was not long before the snake came back for the second time, but when it no longer saw the crown, it crept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it as long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead. If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole."
Third Story.
"A snake cries, “Huhu, huhu.” A child says, “Come out.” The snake comes out, then the child inquires about her little sister: “Hast thou not seen little Red-stockings?” The snake says, “No.” “Neither have I.”"
"“Then I am like you. Huhu, huhu, huhu.”"
106 The Poor Miller’s Boy and the Cat
"In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him. As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best horse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.” The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, “Thou mayst just as well stay here, as long as thou livest thou wilt never get a horse.” Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, heavens, where am I?”"
"Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, “Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?” Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?” “Alas, thou canst not help me.” “I well know your desire,” said the cat. “You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.” “Well, this is a wonderful cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.” So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music."
"One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, “Now, Hans, come and dance with me.” “No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.” “Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats. So one of them lighted him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. “That feels very soft!” said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper."
"So he chopped the wood small; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw anyone but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again carefully. So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward. “No,” said the cat, “you must first do something more for me of the same kind. There is timber of silver, carpenter’s axe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small house.” Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?"
"“Yes,” said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. And now she gave him to eat and drink, and said, “Go home, I will not give thee thy horse away with thee; but in three days’ time I will follow thee and bring it.” So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had, however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him. When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was. “It will follow me in three days’ time.” Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?”"
"“It will be a fine one!” Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw. In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller’s boy. And a magnificent princess alighted from the coach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little tabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was? Then the miller said, “We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged; he is lying in the goose-house.”"
Then the King’s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
"So they brought him out, and he had to hold his little smock-frock together to cover himself. The servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome. Then the maiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. “And that is for the third miller’s boy,” said she. “Then he must have the mill,” said the miller, but the King’s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. They first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside it was of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. After this, let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance."
107 The Two Travellers
"Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,"
acknowledged the authority of the Ancients without any evidence. How
"naïvely he appeals to Antiquity, again and again, to justify some bold"
"feat! He is critical, they say? Were not the Ancients critical? He"
"permits himself to insert digressions? So did the Ancients, etc."
Erasmus is in profound sympathy with that revered Antiquity by his
fundamental conviction that it is the practice of life which matters.
Not he is the great philosopher who knows the tenets of the Stoics or
Peripatetics by rote--but he who expresses the meaning of philosophy by
"his life and his morals, for that is its purpose. He is truly a divine"
"who teaches, not by artful syllogisms, but by his disposition, by his"
"face and his eyes, by his life itself, that wealth should be despised."
To live up to that standard is what Christ himself calls _Renascentia_.
Erasmus uses the word in the Christian sense only. But in that sense it
is closely allied to the idea of the Renaissance as a historical
phenomenon. The worldly and pagan sides of the Renaissance have nearly
"always been overrated. Erasmus is, much more than Aretino or"
"Castiglione, the representative of the spirit of his age, one over whose"
Christian sentiment the sweet gale of Antiquity had passed. And that
very union of strong Christian endeavour and the spirit of Antiquity is
the explanation of Erasmus's wonderful success.
*       *       *       *       *
The mere intention and the contents of the mind do not influence the
"world, if the form of expression does not cooperate. In Erasmus the"
quality of his talent is a very important factor. His perfect clearness
"and ease of expression, his liveliness, wit, imagination, gusto and"
humour have lent a charm to all he wrote which to his contemporaries was
"irresistible and captivates even us, as soon as we read him. In all that"
"constitutes his talent, Erasmus is perfectly and altogether a"
"representative of the Renaissance. There is, in the first place, his"
"her husband's execution, the woman said, she had had to become the"
mistress of the sergeant-major who resided with her as the only
"means, seemingly, of saving her one remaining young son from exile"
in Germany and her daughters from unbearably brutal treatment;
"though she added, ""As to their virtue, _that_ has long since"
vanished; all I ask is that they be not half-killed whenever the
soldiers get drunk. Oh Madame! If you could only say a word to that
"Colonel with whom you are living?"""
"Mrs. Warren dared not translate this last sentence to Vivie, for"
fear her daughter forced her at all costs to leave the Hotel
"Impérial. Where, if she did, were they to go?"
The winter of 1914 had witnessed an appalling degree of
"frightfulness in eastern Belgium, the Wallon or French-speaking part"
of the country more especially. The Germans seemed to bear a special
"grudge against this region, regarding it as doggedly opposed to"
absorption into a Greater Germany; whereas they hoped the Flemish
half of the country would receive them as fellow Teutons and even as
deliverers from their former French oppressors. Thousands of old men
"and youths, of women and children in the provinces south of the"
Meuse had been shot in cold blood; village after village had been
burnt. Scenes of nearly equal horror had taken place between
"Brussels and Antwerp, especially around Malines. Von Bissing's"
arrival as Governor General was soon signalized by those dreaded Red
"Placards on the walls of Brussels, announcing the verdicts of"
"courts-martial, the condemnation to death of men and women who had"
contravened some military regulation.
"Yet in spite of this, life went on in Brussels once more--by von"
Bissing's stern command--as though the country were not under the
heel of the invader. The theatres opened their doors; the cinemas
"Church and State and society, seemed simple. Nothing was required but"
"restoration and purification by a return to the original, unspoilt"
"sources of Christianity. A number of accretions to the faith, rather"
"ridiculous than revolting, had to be cleared away. All should be reduced"
"to the nucleus of faith, Christ and the Gospel. Forms, ceremonies,"
speculations should make room for the practice of true piety. The Gospel
was easily intelligible to everybody and within everybody's reach. And
"the means to reach all this was good learning, _bonae literae_. Had he"
"not himself, by his editions of the New Testament and of Jerome, and"
"even earlier by the now famous _Enchiridion_, done most of what had to"
"be done? 'I hope that what now pleases the upright, will soon please"
all.' As early as the beginning of 1517 Erasmus had written to Wolfgang
"Fabricius Capito, in the tone of one who has accomplished the great"
"task. 'Well then, take you the torch from us. The work will henceforth"
be a great deal easier and cause far less hatred and envy. _We_ have
lived through the first shock.'
Budaeus writes to Tunstall in May 1517: 'Was anyone born under such
inauspicious Graces that the dull and obscure discipline (scholasticism)
"does not revolt him, since sacred literature, too, cleansed by Erasmus's"
"diligence, has regained its ancient purity and brightness? But it is"
still much greater that he should have effected by the same labour the
"emergence of sacred truth itself out of that Cimmerian darkness, even"
though divinity is not yet quite free from the dirt of the sophist
"school. If that should occur one day, it will be owing to the beginnings"
made in our times.' The philologist Budaeus believed even more firmly
than Erasmus that faith was a matter of erudition.
It could not but vex Erasmus that not everyone accepted the cleansed
"truth at once. How could people continue to oppose themselves to what,"
"to him, seemed as clear as daylight and so simple? He, who so sincerely"
"would have liked to live in peace with all the world, found himself"
"cliffs. Each was followed at regular intervals, until a double row of"
swift air-craft flying with methodical precision headed towards the
Flanders shore.
"Already the ""Sunderland"" and three other light cruisers, accompanied"
"by a torpedo-boat destroyer flotilla, were shaping a course for the"
Belgian coast.
Off the East Goodwins they were joined by two monitors and three
"pre-Dreadnought battleships, and the battle line was formed. Away"
"steamed the destroyers to act as screens to the heavier vessels, and"
to guard them from submarine attack. The monitors led the main
"division, the cruisers acting as links between them and the"
"battleships, which, owing to their greater draught, could not"
approach the coast nearer than a distance of from four to seven
miles.
From Aubyn's point of view the forthcoming operations were entirely
new. For the first time in his experience he was to take part in an
"action between ships and shore batteries, the latter being both fixed"
and mobile. It was a comparatively easy matter to plant shells into
"forts the position of which were known, but the Germans had brought"
"up heavy guns mounted on travelling platforms, which could be moved"
"with considerable celerity behind the long, low-lying sand dunes"
between Nieuport and Zeebrugge.
It was partly to locate the latter that the airmen had preceded the
"bombarding ships, and also to harass the enemy's lines of"
"communication. Moreover, hostile submarines were reported to have"
"been brought in sections to Zeebrugge, where they were being bolted"
together ready to take the offensive against the British vessels
operating off the Belgian coast.
Luther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.
Moreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear
thought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common
people. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people
and they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were these
songs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that “Luther’s songs
have damned more souls than all his books and speeches.”
_Chorales._ The word “chorale” (“choral” in German) refers to the hymn
"tunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term"
includes the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to
do with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.
Many of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some were
borrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable
number were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic Church; still
others were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was an eclectic in
his choice of music. He used any tune from any source that suited his
purpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence in Germany
during his time and the two centuries that followed. The hundreds still
in use represent the best in church music today. They are characterized
"by a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm; all of which"
adapts them well for effective congregational singing.
The chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later
"took on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach’s day,"
"had come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the"
"interest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original"
“rhythmic chorales.”
Though _unison_ singing has been widely practiced and is advocated today
"by some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged part"
seemed a laudable purpose--that is if hanging is ever laudable--but the
Panama officials are quite as determined to keep the wheels of their
criminal law moving. The proprietors of machines like to see them
run--which is one of the reasons why too many battleships are not good
for a nation.

"To return, however, to the statistics of the Zone. Its population is"
"shifting, of course, and varies somewhat in its size according to the"
extent to which labor is in demand. The completion of a part of the work
"occasionally reduces the force. In January, 1912, the total population"
"of the Zone, according to the official census, was 62,810; at the same"
"time, by the same authority, there were employed by the Canal Commission"
"and the Panama Railroad 36,600 men. These figures emphasize the fact"
"that the working force on the Zone is made up mainly of unmarried men,"
"for a working population of 36,600 would, under the conditions existing"
"in the ordinary American community, give a population of well over"
"100,000. Though statistics are not on hand, and would probably be"
"impossible to compile among the foreign laborers, it is probable that"
not more than one man in four on the Zone is married. From this
situation it results that the average maiden who visits the Zone for a
brief holiday goes rushing home to get her trousseau ready before some
young engineer’s next annual vacation shall give him time to go like a
"young Lochinvar in search of his bride. Indeed, the life of the Zone for"
"many reasons has been singularly conducive to matrimony, and as a game"
"preserve for the exciting sport of husband-hunting, it has been"
unexcelled.

loaves of bread; and I saw with my own eyes a list of a hundred and
"thirty-eight bakehouses. The roar of the ways, choked with soldiers"
"and citizens, the babel of strange tongues, the clamour of bells and"
"trumpets, deafened us. The constant crowding and pushing and halting"
turned our heads. I forgot my grief and my hope too. Who but a madman
would look to find a single face where thousands gazed from the
"windows? or could deem himself important with this swarming, teeming"
hive before him? Steve stared stupidly about him; I rode dazed and
"perplexed. The troopers laughed at us, or promised us greater things"
"when we should see the Swedish Lager outside the town, and"
Wallenstein's great camp arrayed against it. But I noticed that even
"they, as we drew nearer to the heart of the city, fell silent at"
"times, and looked at one another, surprised at the great influx of"
people and the shifting scenes which the streets presented.
"For myself and Steve and the men, we were as good as nought. A house"
in the Ritter-Strasse was assigned to my lady for her quarters--no one
could lodge in the city without the leave of the magistrates; and we
"were glad to get into it and cool our dizzy heads, and look at one"
"another. Count Hugo stayed awhile, standing with my lady and the"
Waldgrave in one of the great oriels that overlooked the street. But a
"mounted messenger, sent on from the Town House, summoned him, and he"
took horse again for the camp. I do not know what we should have done
"without him at entering. The soldiers, who crowded the streets, showed"
"scant respect for names, and would as soon have jostled my lady as a"
citizen's wife; but wherever he came hats were doffed and voices
"lowered, and in the greatest press a way was made for him as by magic."
"For that night we had seen enough. I thought we had seen all, or that"
nothing in my life would ever surprise me again. But next day my lady
went up to the Burg on the hill in the middle of the city to look
"abroad, and took Steve and myself with her. And then I found that I"

Another Panamanian product which the tourists buy eagerly but which is
rapidly becoming rare is the pearl. In the Gulf of Panama are a group of
islands which have been known as Las Islas des Perlas--the Pearl
"Islands. This archipelago is about thirty miles long, with sixteen big"
"islands and a quantity of small ones, and lies about sixty miles south"
of Panama City. Balboa saw them from the shore and intended to visit
them but never did. Pizarro stopped there on his way to Peru and
plundered them to his heart’s content. Otherwise their history has been
uneventful. Saboga on the island of the same name is a beautiful little
"tropical village of about 300 huts, on a high bluff bordering a bay"
that affords excellent anchorage. Whales are plentiful in these waters
"and Pacific whalers are often seen in port. San Miguel, the largest town"
"of the archipelago, is on Rey Island and has about 1000 inhabitants. The"
"tower of its old church is thickly inlaid with glistening, pearly shell."
[Illustration: DESPOILING OLD GUAYMI GRAVES]
"The pearl fisheries have been overworked for years, perhaps centuries,"
and begin to show signs of being exhausted. Nevertheless the tourist who
takes the trip to the islands from the City of Panama will find himself
beset by children as he lands offering seed pearls in quantities.
Occasionally real bargains may be had from “beach combers” not only at
"Rey Island, but even at Taboga, where I knew an American visitor to pick"
up for eleven dollars three pearls valued at ten or twelve times as much
when shown in the United States. There are stories of lucky finds among
divers that vie with the tales of nuggets among gold prospectors. Once a
native boy diving for sport in one of the channels near Naos Island
brought up an oyster in which was a black pearl that was sold in Panama
"for $3000. The report does not say how much of this the boy got, but as"
track of foreign bodies carried in with the projectile. See case 160.
Fig. 84 illustrates an example where the limitation to the abdominal
wall was evident on inspection. Here the division of the thick muscles
of the abdominal wall had led to the formation of a swelling exactly
"similar to that seen after the subcutaneous rupture of a muscle, and two"
soft fluctuating tumours bounded by contracted muscle existed in the
substance of the oblique and rectus muscles.
[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Wound of Abdominal Wall (Lee-Metford). Division
of fibres of external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles. Case 159]
The cases which presented the most serious diagnostic difficulty in this
relation were those in which the wound was situated in the thicker
muscular portions of the lower part of the abdominal and pelvic walls.
"Such a case is illustrated in the chapter on fractures (see fig. 55, p."
"191). I saw one or two such instances, in which only the exploration"
necessary for treatment of the fracture decided the point. In many of
the wounds affecting the lateral portion of the abdominal wall the
"question of penetration could never be definitely cleared up, as wounds"
of the colon sometimes gave rise to absolutely no symptoms.
In a certain proportion of the injuries the peritoneal cavity was no
"doubt perforated without the infliction of any further visceral injury,"
and in these also the doubt as to the occurrence of penetration was
never solved.
(158) _Wound of belly wall._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches below the centre of the left iliac crest;"
"_exit_, 1-1/2 inch above and internal to the left anterior"
superior iliac spine. The patient was on horseback at the time
"of the injury and did not fall; he got down, however, and lay"
placed--a point in the argument which left an opportunity open to Kant
"to suggest a new development, to ask whether things being found"
"inadequate in producing knowledge, we might not ask if knowledge could"
not be more successful with things. But it is the Scottish lines of
"attempted solution that we wish to follow out, and not the German."
Perhaps they are not so very different.
"Philosophy, as Reid found it, was in a bad way enough, as far as the"
orthodox mind of Scotland was concerned. All justification for belief
"in God, in immortality, in all that was held sacred in a century of"
"much orthodoxy if little zeal, was gone. Such things might be believed"
"in by those who found any comfort in so believing, but to the educated"
"man who had seriously reflected on them, they were anachronisms. The"
"very desperateness of the case, however, seemed to promise a remedy."
"Men could not rest in a state of permanent scepticism, in a world"
utterly incapable of being rationally explained. Even the propounder of
"the theories allowed this to be true; and as for others, they felt that"
"they were rational beings, and this signified that there was system in"
the world.
"A champion arose when things were at their worst in Thomas Reid, the"
"founder, or at least the chiefest ornament, of the so-called Scottish"
School of Philosophy. He it was who set himself to add the principle of
"the coherence of the Universe, and the consequent possibility of"
"establishing Faith once more in the world. Reid, to begin with, instead"
"of looking at Hume's results as serious, regarded them as necessarily"
"absurd. He started a new theory of his own, the theory of Immediate"
"Perception, which signified that we are able immediately to"
"apprehend--not ideas only, but the Truth. And how, we may ask, can this"
be done?
It had been pointed out first of all that sensations as understood by
depression on the stone wall by which we descend to the lower dungeon
"is shown as the spot against which St. Peter's head rested, though our"
guide had just told us that these stairs were not in existence then and
prisoners were let down into the dungeon through the hole in the middle
of the stone floor. Such trifling discrepancies do not seem to trouble
the average Italian mind.
St. Peter and St. Paul are said to have been bound in this prison for
"nine months to a pillar, which is shown here. ""A fountain of excellent"
water beneath the floor of the prison is attributed to the prayers
"of St. Peter, that he might have wherewith to baptize his gaolers,"
"Processus and Martinianus; but, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical"
"tradition, the fountain is described by Plutarch as having existed at"
"the time of Jugurtha's imprisonment"" here, long before the time of St."
Peter.
"Another miraculous spring, still flowing, is shown in the Church of SS."
Cosmo and Damiano as that which burst forth in answer to the prayers of
"Felix IV., that he might have water to baptize his disciples."
[Sidenote: What the Head of St. Paul Did.]
But the most interesting of all the miraculous springs in or around
"Rome are the three fountains, about two miles from the city, where the"
Apostle Paul was executed. When his head was severed from his body it
"bounded from the earth three times, crying out thrice, ""Jesus! Jesus!"
"Jesus!"" A fountain burst from the ground at each of the three spots"
"where the severed head struck. It is asserted, in proof of this origin"
"of the fountains, that the water of the first is still warm, of the"
"second tepid, and of the third cold, but we drank of them one after"
another without being able to detect any difference in temperature. The
apostle's head is shown in bas relief upon the three altars above the
"double wall of cells inclosing a body cavity, and with an opening,"
the primitive mouth. Each of these early embryological stages is
"represented by living animals,--the undivided cell by the"
"PROTOZOA, the blastosphere by some rare forms, and the gastrula in"
"the essential structure of the COELENTERATES,--the subkingdom to"
which the fresh-water hydra and the corals belong. All forms of
"animal life, from the coelenterates to the mammals, follow the"
same path in their embryological development as far as the
"gastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge, those of each"
subkingdom going their own separate ways.
"We may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods"
organic evolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The
earliest one-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-
"celled animals of the type of the blastosphere, and these by"
gastrula-like organisms. From the gastrula type the higher sub-
"divisions of animal life probably diverged, as separate branches"
from a common trunk. Much or all of this vast differentiation was
accomplished before the opening of the next era; for all the
subkingdoms are represented in the Cambrian except the
vertebrates.
EVIDENCES OF PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE. An indirect evidence of life
during the pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and
"varied fauna of the next period; for, if the theory of evolution"
"is correct, the differentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long"
process which might well have required for its accomplishment a
large part of pre-Cambrian time.
"Other indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron"
"ores, and graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have"
been formed in later times by the help of organisms. If the
which proceeding I speak of later in detail. (See Chapter on Questions.)
We now come to the question as to what proportion of _Dramatic
Excitement_ we should present in the stories for a normal group of
"children. Personally, I should like, while the child is very young"
"(I mean in mind, not in years) to exclude the element of dramatic"
"excitement, but though this may be possible for the individual child,"
it is quite Utopian to hope we can keep the average child free from
"what is in the atmosphere. Children crave for excitement, and unless we"
"give it to them in legitimate form, they will take it in any riotous"
"form it presents itself, and if from our experience we can control"
"their mental digestion by a moderate supply of what they demand, we"
may save them from devouring too eagerly the raw material they can so
easily find for themselves.
There is a humorous passage bearing on this question in the story of
"the small Scotch boy, when he asks leave of his parents to present the"
pious little book--a gift to himself from his Aunt--to a little sick
"friend, hoping probably that the friend's chastened condition will make"
him more lenient towards this mawkish form of literature. The parents
"expostulate, pointing out to their son how ungrateful he is, and how"
ungracious it would be to part with his Aunt's gift. Then the boy can
"contain himself no longer. He bursts out, unconsciously expressing the"
normal attitude of children at a certain stage of development: “It's
a _daft_ book ony way; there's naebody gets kilt en't. I like stories
"about folk getting their heids cut off, or stabbit through and through,"
wi' swords an' spears. An' there's nae wile beasts. I like Stories
"about black men gettin' ate up, an' white men killin' lions and tigers"
an' bears an'----”
"Then, again, we have the passage from George Eliot's “Mill on the"
Floss”:
better than dogma--Erasmus's talent and wit--Delight in words
and things--Prolixity--Observation of details--A veiled
realism--Ambiguousness--The 'Nuance'--Inscrutability of the
ultimate ground of all things
"Simplicity, naturalness, purity, and reasonableness, those are to"
"Erasmus the dominant requirements, also when we pass from his ethical"
"and aesthetic concepts to his intellectual point of view; indeed, the"
two can hardly be kept apart.
"The world, says Erasmus, is overloaded with human constitutions and"
"opinions and scholastic dogmas, and overburdened with the tyrannical"
"authority of orders, and because of all this the strength of gospel"
"doctrine is flagging. Faith requires simplification, he argued. What"
would the Turks say of our scholasticism? Colet wrote to him one day:
"'There is no end to books and science. Let us, therefore, leave all"
roundabout roads and go by a short cut to the truth.'
"Truth must be simple. 'The language of truth is simple, says Seneca;"
"well then, nothing is simpler nor truer than Christ.' 'I should wish',"
"Erasmus says elsewhere, 'that this simple and pure Christ might be"
"deeply impressed upon the mind of men, and that I deem best attainable"
"in this way, that we, supported by our knowledge of the original"
"languages, should philosophize _at the sources_ themselves.'"
Here a new watchword comes to the fore: back to the sources! It is not
"merely an intellectual, philological requirement; it is equally an"
"ethical and aesthetic necessity of life. The original and pure, all that"
"is not yet overgrown or has not passed through many hands, has such a"
potent charm. Erasmus compared it to an apple which we ourselves pick
"off the tree. To recall the world to the ancient simplicity of science,"
"Petrol was, at the moment, the most important of our needs; we had,"
"therefore, to carry with us all we should require, making allowance"
"at the same time for mishaps. Moreover, we had to take enough food"
"and water to last Allan, Allah-dad and myself for five or six days."
"As regards personal luggage we travelled absolutely light, leaving"
"all kit to follow at a slower pace on camels, together with my horse,"
"Galahad. I had some compunction in leaving the latter behind, but my"
"orders were concise and urgent--to reach Robat, endeavour to get into"
"touch with all our scattered posts, and effect a combination against"
the Raiders at the earliest possible moment.
"A start was made very early in the morning, but the first day's"
journey proved disappointing. Instead of doing the ninety miles
"planned, we only accomplished thirty. The track was even worse than I"
"had expected, for we constantly ran into sand-hills, and had to dig"
the car out. I have never done so much digging in my life as I did on
"that journey to Robat. Sand-hills were, however, only a portion of"
"our afflictions, for, in addition, there were many water pools and"
small shallow lakes--due to recent rain--which had to be taken at a
"rush, or somehow circumvented."
"So serious, at last, did our rate of progress become that, as we"
"approached what seemed to be the hundredth of these wide, shallow"
"pools, I lost patience and ordered Allan to drive straight through."
"He attempted to carry out the order, but about half-way we sank up"
to the axle and stuck. No power on earth would induce the car to
"budge another inch, and, though we all three got out into the water,"
"and lugged, pushed and dragged at the wretched car, no impression"
could be made upon her.
"Bill Dawson takes a bit of knowing."""
"""Have you any news, Mr. Dawson?"" asked Cary eagerly."
"""Not much. The wires of the _Antinous_ have all been renewed--the"
Admiralty won't allow cables to be patched except at sea--but I
haven't found out who played hanky-panky with them. It could not have
"been any one in the engine-room party, as none of them went near the"
"place where the wires were cut. Besides, they were engineers, not"
"electricians, and could have known nothing of the arrangements and"
disposition of the ship's wires. My man who worked with them is
"positive that they are a sound, good lot without a sea-lawyer or a"
"pacifist among them; a gang of plain, honest tykes. So we are thrown"
"back on the maintenance party, included in which were all sorts of"
ratings. Some of them are skilled in the electrical fittings--my own
"man with them is, for one--but we get the best accounts of all of"
"them. They are long service men, cast for sea owing to various medical"
"reasons, but perfectly efficient for harbour work. Among the officers"
of the ship is a R.N.R. lieutenant with a German name. I jumped to
"him, but the captain laughed. The man's father and grandfather were in"
"the English merchant service, and though his people originally came"
"from Saxony, he is no more German than we are ourselves. Besides, my"
experience is that an Englishman with an inherited German name is the
very last man to have any truck with the enemy. He is too much ashamed
of his forbears for one thing; and for another he is too dead set on
living down his beastly name. So we will rule out the Lieutenant
"R.N.R. My own man, who is a petty officer R.N.V.R., and has worked on"
"a lot of ships which have come in for repairs, says that the temper"
among the workmen in the yards is good now. It was ugly when dilution
"of labour first came in, but the wages are so high that all that"
trouble has settled down. I have had what you call sabotage in the
"shell and gun shops, but never yet in the King's ships. We have had"
probability of bloodshed is reported to the king. To restore the courage
"of the despairing Gorboduc is now the labour of his counsellors, but the"
later announcement of the death of Ferrex casts him lower than before.
"At this point the Chorus, recalling the murder of a cousin in an earlier"
"generation of the royal race, points, in true Aeschylean fashion, to the"
hatred of an unsated revenge behind this latest blow:
"Thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race,"
"Whose murderous hand, imbru'd with guiltless blood,"
"Asks vengeance still before the heaven's face,"
With endless mischiefs on the cursed brood.
"_Act IV, Scene 1._--Videna alone, in words of passionate vehemence,"
"laments that she has lived so long to see the death of Ferrex, renounces"
"his brother as no child of hers, and concludes with a threat of"
"vengeance. _Scene 2._--Bowed down with remorse, Porrex makes his defence"
"before the king, pleading the latter's own act, in dividing the kingdom,"
as the initial cause of the ensuing disaster. Before he has been long
"gone from his father's presence, Marcella, a lady-in-waiting, rushes"
"into the room, in wild disorder and grief, to report his murder at his"
"mother's hand. In anguished words she tells how, stabbed by Videna in"
"his sleep, he started up and, spying the queen by his side, called to"
"her for help, not crediting that she, his mother, could be his"
"murderess. Again, in tones of solemn warning, the Chorus reminds the"
audience that
"Blood asketh blood, and death must death requite:"
"Jove, by his just and everlasting doom,"
Justly hath ever so requited it.

of the king and queen at the hands of their subjects in revolt against

the powdered alum to arrest the flow of joint oil (synovia). For
"catarrhal ophthalmia, after the acute stage, an alum lotion five grains"
to one ounce of water is very serviceable; for granular lids rub with a
crystal of alum. Alum should never be used too strong over the eye as it
seems to have the power of dissolving the cornea; a solution containing
ten grains of alum to the ounce of water may be used in canker of the
ear of dogs; also for leucorrhoea and prolapsus of the rectum; dried
"alum may be used as a caustic whenever a caustic is indicated, but is"
"not recommended for this purpose. For a powerful drying powder,"
especially useful when excessive granulation exists. It causes sloughing
of the dead tissues and is indicated when the use of the knife is

"The semi-private, semi-public character of the letters often made them"
compromising. What one could say to a friend in confidence might
"possibly injure when many read it. Erasmus, who never was aware how"
"injuriously he expressed himself, repeatedly gave rise to"
"misunderstanding and estrangement. Manners, so to say, had not yet"
"adapted themselves to the new art of printing, which increased the"
publicity of the written word a thousandfold. Only gradually under this
"new influence was the separation effected between the public word,"
"intended for the press, and the private communication, which remains in"
writing and is read only by the recipient.
"Meanwhile, with the growth of Erasmus's fame, his earlier writings, too,"
had risen in the public estimation. The great success of the
"_Enchiridion militis christiani_ had begun about 1515, when the times"
were much riper for it than eleven years before. 'The _Moria_ is
"embraced as the highest wisdom,' writes John Watson to him in 1516. In"
"the same year we find a word used, for the first time, which expresses"
better than anything else how much Erasmus had become a centre of
"authority: _Erasmiani_. So his German friends called themselves,"
according to Johannes Sapidus. More than a year later Dr. Johannes Eck
"employs the word still in a rather friendly sense, as a generally"
"current term: 'all scholars in Germany are Erasmians,' he says. But"
"Erasmus did not like the word. 'I find nothing in myself', he replies,"
"'why anyone should wish to be an Erasmicus, and, altogether, I hate"
"those party names. We are all followers of Christ, and to His glory we"
"all drudge, each for his part.' But he knows that now the question is:"
for or against him! From the brilliant latinist and the man of wit of
his prime he had become the international pivot on which the
civilization of his age hinged. He could not help beginning to feel
"himself the brain, the heart and the conscience of his times. It might"
even appear to him that he was called to speak the great redeeming word
"or, perhaps, that he had already spoken it. The faith in an easy triumph"
liquefies in four minutes.[8]
"""And here, also, they used to have a grand procession"
"of priests, citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries"
"of the city government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up"
"Madonna--a stuffed and painted image, like the milliner's dummy--whose"
hair miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They
still kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years
ago. It was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the
"remarkable effigy, and the public barbering of her was always carried"
"out with the greatest _éclat_ and display--the more the better, because"
the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew
and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last the day came
"when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the city"
government stopped the Madonna's annual show.
"""There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliest"
"possible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully"
"believed, and the other half either believed or else said nothing"
"about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture."""
[Sidenote: The House of the Virgin at Loretto.]
"I had read the story of the _Casa Santa_, or Holy House, the little"
"stone building, thirteen and one-half feet high and twenty-eight feet"
"long, in which the Virgin Mary had lived at Nazareth. In 336 the"
"Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage"
to Nazareth and built a church over the Holy House. This church fell
"into decay when the Saracens again got the upper hand in Palestine,"
and when the Christians lost Ptolemais the Holy House was carried by
angels through the air from Nazareth to the coast of Dalmatia. This
miraculous transportation took place in 1291. A few years later it
gave me a extra week or two in 'orspittle. I 'ad to go in the end
"though--the M.O. didn't 'alf give me a tellin' orf. Jesus Christ, didn't"
I 'ave the wind up when we went up the line! An' now I'm scared at the
"slightest sound, an' I sometimes wake up out o' me sleep shiverin' all"
over. When I was on leave a motor-car backfired in the street--it didn't
'alf make me jump; me mate 'oo was with me said I looked as white as a
"sheet. The longer yer out 'ere the worse yer get--it's yer nerves, yer"
"know, they can't stand it. In the line it's always the new men what's"
"the most reliable...."""
"""That's a bloody fact. When we first come out, I thought all the Belgian"

"_We_ used to stand an' look at 'im. They wasn't cowards, it was us who"
"was bloody fools. They knew summat about it, we didn't. All the same, I"

"""Napoleon was right,"" observed a small, red-haired lance-corporal, whose"
"remarks generally had a sardonic touch, ""when he said the worse the man"
the better the soldier. It's only people who have no imagination and no
intelligence who are courageous in modern war. Nobody with any sense
would expose himself unnecessarily and rush a machine-gun position or do
"the sort of thing they give you a V.C. for. Of course, there are a few"
"cases where it's deserved, and it isn't always the one who deserves it"
"that gets it. I'm quite certain the refined, sensitive, imaginative kind"
of man is no good as a soldier. He may be able to control himself better
than the others at first--educated people are used to self-control--but
in the long run his nerves will give way sooner. Moral courage is a
"thing I admire more than anything, but there's no use for it in the"
"army, in fact it's worse than useless in the army. The man who's too"
It was interesting to follow up the way it had come. The earlier news
"about the Dobuans had been brought by the canoes, which had fetched"
"the sago to Gumasila from the main island. A few days later, a canoe"
"from one of the main island villages had arrived here, and on its"
way had passed the Dobuans in Tewara. The news from the Trobriands
in the North had been brought by the Kuyawa canoe which had arrived a
couple of days before in Nabwageta (and whose visit to Nu'agasi I have
"described in Chapter XI). All these movements were not accidental,"
"but connected with the uvalaku expedition. To show the complexity,"
"as well as the precise timing of the various movements and events,"
"so perfectly synchronised over a vast area, in connection with the"
"uvalaku, I have tabulated them in the Chart, facing this page, in"
"which almost all the dates are quite exact, being based on my own"
"observations. This Chart also gives a clear, synoptic picture of an"
"uvalaku, and it will be useful to refer to it, in reading this Chapter."
"In olden days, not less than now, there must have been an ebullition"
"in the inter-tribal relations, and a great stirring from one place"
"to another, whenever an uvalaku Kula was afoot. Thus, news would"
"be carried rapidly over great distances, the movements of the vast"
"numbers of natives would be co-ordinated, and dates fixed. As has been"
"said already, a culminating event of an expedition, in this case the"
"arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa, would be always so timed"
"as to happen on, or just before, a full moon, and this would serve"
"as a general orientation for the preliminary movements, such as in"
"this case, the visits of the single canoes."

love and was dominated by a passion for this man.
"So that, with no reason whatever in her mind to question the sincerity"
"of Johnson's love for her, it would seem as if nothing were wanting to"
make the Girl perfectly happy; that there could be no room in her heart
"for any feeling other than elation. And yet, curiously enough, the Girl"
could not doze off to sleep. Some mysterious force--a vague foreboding
of something about to happen--impelled her to open her eyes again and
again.
"It was an odd and wholly new sensation, this conjuring up of distressing"
"spectres, for no girl was given less to that sort of thing; all the"
"same, it was with difficulty that she checked an impulse to cry out to"
"her lover--whom she believed to be asleep--and make him dissipate, by"
"renewed assurances, the mysterious barrier which she felt was hemming"
her in.
"As for Johnson, the moment that his head had touched the pillows, he"
"fell to thinking of the awkward situation in which he was placed, the"
"many complications in which his heart had involved him and, finally, he"
found himself wondering whether the woman whom he loved so dearly was
also lying sleepless in her rug on the floor.
And so it was not surprising that he should spring up the moment that he
heard cries from outside.
"""Who's that knockin', I wonder?"""
"Although her voice showed no signs of distress or annoyance, the"
"question coming from her in a calm tone, the Girl was upon her feet"
almost before she knew it. In a trice she removed all evidences that she
"had been lying upon the floor, flinging the pillows and silk coverlet to"
acts (or legislation) we destroy the very tracts we have improved.
"The Indian must ultimately be merged into the body politic, as has been"
"affirmed. But in bringing about this desideratum, it is not necessary to"
crush all happiness out of his life. For fifty years the Indian has
"followed a devious and uncertain trail, in the fond hope that he might"
"reach his journey’s end. If men and women, who through unintentional"
"ignorance have given no heed to the welfare of our red Americans, will"
"interest their Representatives in Congress, and also help to crystallize"
"public opinion against further harmful legislation, it is quite possible"
that the National Commission plan may be carried into effect. After many
"years of study of the subject, I firmly believe that the welfare of the"
Indian depends upon the creation of such a Commission as has been
"indicated—one composed not of those interested in political parties, but"
"on the contrary of competent men who understand Indians and their needs,"
of men who are willing to devote the best years of their lives to
"transforming the rough, uncertain trail along which the Indian has"
"toiled, into a broad highway, upon which the Red Man may safely travel"
to his ultimate destination—the civilized community. And having reached
"the end of his journey, the Indian will live henceforth peacefully, and"
"enjoy to the full the blessings of liberty, equality and justice."

"the custom of other snakes, he will not flee on hearing a footstep. When"
"anyone approaches he lies more still than ever, not even a movement of"
"his head betraying him. He is so like the colour of the ground, he hopes"
"he will be passed unseen; and he is slow and lethargic in his movements,"
"and so is easy to kill when once detected. As a Burman said, 'If he sees"
"you first, he kills you; if you see him first, you kill him.'"
In this district no Burman hesitates a moment in killing a viper when
he has the chance. Usually he has to do it in self-defence. This viper
"is terribly feared, as over a hundred persons a year die here by his"
bite. He is so hated and feared that he has become an outcast from the
law that protects all life.
"But with other snakes it is not so. There is the hamadryad, for"
"instance. He is a great snake about ten to fourteen feet long, and he is"
"the only snake that will attack you first. He is said always to do so,"
certainly he often does. One attacked me once when out quail-shooting.
He put up his great neck and head suddenly at a distance of only five or
"six feet, and was just preparing to strike, when I literally blew his"
head off with two charges of shot.
You would suppose he was vicious enough to be included with the
"Russell's viper in the category of the exceptions, but no. Perhaps he is"
too rare to excite such fierce and deadly hate as makes the Burman
"forget his law and kill the viper. However it may be, the Burman is not"
ready to kill the hamadryad. A few weeks ago a friend of mine and myself
came across two little Burman boys carrying a jar with a piece of broken
"tile over it. The lads kept lifting up the tile and peeping in, and then"
"putting the tile on again in a great hurry, and their actions excited"
"our curiosity. So we called them to come to us, and we looked into the"
jar. It was full of baby hamadryads. The lads had found a nest of them
"in the absence of the mother, who would have killed them if she had"
carefully and tenderly about her.
Concha raised her eyes once to his as he fastened its chain-catch
"beneath her chin, and Rollo, though the starlight dimmed the brilliance"
"of the glance, felt more than repaid. In the background Etienne smiled"
bitterly. The damsel of the green lattice being now left far behind at
"Sarria, he would have had no scruples about returning to his allegiance"
to Concha. But the chill indifference with which his advances were
"received, joined to something softer and more appealing in her eyes when"
"she looked at Rollo, warned the much-experienced youth that he had"
better for the future confine his gallantries to the most common and
ordinary offices of courtesy.
"Yet it was certainly a restraint upon the young Frenchman, who, almost"
"from the day he had been rid of his Jesuit tutor, had made it a maxim to"
make love to the prettiest girl of any company in which he happened to
find himself.
"When, therefore, he found himself reduced to a choice between an"
"inaccessible Concha and La Giralda, riding astride in her leathern"
"leg-gear and sack-like smock, the youth bethought himself of his"
"religious duties which he had latterly somewhat neglected; and, being"
debarred from earthly love by Concha's insensibility and La Giralda's
"ineligibility, it did not cost him a great effort to become for the"
nonce the same Brother Hilario who had left the monastery of Montblanch.
"So, much to the astonishment of John Mortimer, who moved a little"
"farther from him, as being a kind of second cousin of the scarlet woman"
"of the Seven Hills, Etienne pulled out his rosary and, falling on his"
"knees, betook him to his prayers with vigour and a single mind."
Sergeant Cardono had long ago abandoned all distinctive marks of his
of intrusion by the beasts of the field.

In the typical Indian hut there is no furniture on the ground floor
"other than a rough hewn bench, a few pieces of pottery and gourds, iron"
"cooking vessels and what they call a kitchen, which is in fact a large"
"flat box with raised edges, about eight square feet in surface and about"
as high from the floor as a table. This is filled with sand and slabs of
"stone. In it a little fire is built of wood or charcoal, the stones laid"
about the fire support the pots and pans and cooking goes on as gaily as
"in any modern electric kitchen. The contrivance sounds primitive, but I"
have eaten a number of excellent meals cooked on just such an apparatus.

"Now it will be noticed that in all this habitation, sufficient for the"
"needs of an Indian, there is nothing except the iron pots and possibly"
"some pottery for which money was needed, and there are thousands of"
"families living in just this fashion in Panama today. True, luxury"
approaches in its insidious fashion and here and there you will see a
"$1.25 white iron bed on the main floor, real chairs, canned goods on the"
shelves and--final evidence of Indian prosperity!--a crayon portrait of
"the head of the family and a phonograph, of a make usually discarded at"
home. But when Miguel and Maria start out on the journey of life a
"machete, a gun and the good will of their neighbors who will lend them"

A TYPICAL NATIVE HUT
policy of emperor and pope. People wanted to use his name and make him
choose sides. And that he would not do for any consideration. He wrote
evasively to the Pope about his relations with Luther without altogether
disavowing him. How zealously he defends himself from the suspicion of
"being on Luther's side as noisy monks make out in their sermons, who"
summarily link the two in their scoffing disparagement.
But by the other side also he is pressed to choose sides and to speak
out. Towards the end of October 1520 the coronation of the emperor took
place at Aix-la-Chapelle. Erasmus was perhaps present; in any case he
"accompanied the Emperor to Cologne. There, on 5 November, he had an"
interview about Luther with the Elector Frederick of Saxony. He was
persuaded to write down the result of that discussion in the form of
twenty-two _Axiomata concerning Luther's cause_. Against his intention
they were printed at once.
Erasmus's hesitation in those days between the repudiation and the
approbation of Luther is not discreditable to him. It is the tragic
defect running through his whole personality: his refusal or inability
ever to draw ultimate conclusions. Had he only been a calculating and
"selfish nature, afraid of losing his life, he would long since have"
altogether forsaken Luther's cause. It is his misfortune affecting his
"fame, that he continually shows his weaknesses, whereas what is great in"
him lies deep.
"At Cologne Erasmus also met the man with whom, as a promising young"
"humanist, fourteen years younger than himself, he had, for some months,"
"shared a room in the house of Aldus's father-in-law, at Venice:"
"Hieronymus Aleander, now sent to the Emperor as a papal nuncio, to"
"persuade him to conform his imperial policy to that of the Pope, in the"
"matter of the great ecclesiastical question, and give effect to the"
papal excommunication by the imperial ban.
"a dogma of the most tremendous kind, and an undogmatic Creed is"
as senseless as a statue without shape or a picture without
colour. Unsectarian means un-Christian.“--From _Freethinking
"and Plainspeaking_ (pp. 122-4), by Leslie Stephen. (Longmans,"
London.)
The considerations which seemed to compel the clearheaded author of
this extract to his own well-known intellectual position no longer
"apply. In England, at any rate, the Church is not bound down to any"
"mechanical theory of the inspiration of the Bible, and accepts all the"
discoveries of Modern Physical Science without misgiving. Such books
as the late Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Temple) gave us in his
Bampton Lectures have long ago shown the futility of attempting to map
out the exact terms of a reconciliation between the claims of science
"and religion, but they have shown that religion and science are _not_"
destructive and contradictory of each other.
"“The same principles are found in each. The principle of evolution,"
"for instance, is as evident in the gradual development of religion as"
in the age-long process by which the natural world was created; the
order and beauty and regular succession manifest in Nature can be
traced also in the spiritual universe. The revelation which was
formerly held to be violation of law is seen to be a revelation of
"higher law. The great postulate of science, the uniformity of Nature,"
is not infringed.”
"We know now that there are laws of the Universe which, if we knew more"
"about them, would tell us how it was that a Virgin could conceive and"
bear a Son. It is not to us an inconceivable superstition that “The
Son of Man” should have in His own person powers of which the
"rudimentary signs can be traced in all humanity, manifesting"
themselves from time to time. The day is long past when the
"no peace. Nevertheless, when he is seriously ill he does not fear death."
"His hygienics amount to temperance, cleanliness and fresh air, this last"
item in moderation: he takes the vicinity of the sea to be unwholesome
"and is afraid of draughts. His friend Gilles, who is ill, he advises:"
"'Do not take too much medicine, keep quiet and do not get angry'. Though"
"there is a 'Praise of Medicine' among his works, he does not think"
highly of physicians and satirizes them more than once in the
_Colloquies_.
Also in his outward appearance there were certain features betraying his
"delicacy. He was of medium height, well-made, of a fair complexion with"
"blond hair and blue eyes, a cheerful face, a very articulate mode of"
"speech, but a thin voice."
In the moral sphere Erasmus's delicacy is represented by his great need
"of friendship and concord, his dislike of contention. With him peace and"
"harmony rank above all other considerations, and he confesses them to be"
"the guiding principles of his actions. He would, if it might be, have"
all the world as a friend. 'Wittingly I discharge no one from my
"friendship,' he says. And though he was sometimes capricious and"
"exacting towards his friends, yet a truly great friend he was: witness"
"the many who never forsook him, or whom he, after a temporary"
"estrangement, always won back--More, Peter Gilles, Fisher, Ammonius,"
"Budaeus, and others too numerous to mention. 'He was most constant in"
"keeping up friendships,' says Beatus Rhenanus, whose own attachment to"
Erasmus is a proof of the strong affection he could inspire.
At the root of this desire of friendship lies a great and sincere need
of affection. Remember the effusions of almost feminine affection
towards Servatius during his monastic period. But at the same time it is

I knew I had come into contact with the truly representative man. His
"opinion and the opinions of those like him, they all made up popular"
opinion. All other opinion was abnormal and negligible. It was with
despair that I realized the hopelessness of my own position and that of
my friends.
The public did not understand the war and did not want to understand it.
It was far away from them and they did not realize the amount of
suffering caused by it. It also brought wealth to many who would
therefore have regretted its sudden termination. This seems a hard thing
"to say, but nevertheless it is true. The so-called ""working-classes"" had"
developed an appetite for wealth and power that nothing could satisfy.
"This appetite was being fed continually, but the more it devoured the"
more voracious it became. Nor did the shameless profiteering of the
wealthy tend to allay it in any way. Protests against the war never went
beyond the passing of mere resolutions. Those who had sufficient
humanity and imagination to hate the war in its entirety and to suffer
"from it, although not necessarily taking any part in it, were too few"
and too scattered and isolated to take any effective action.
The extent to which a man can suffer is the precise measure of his
"merit, and thus it was that our patriots and war-enthusiasts being"
"incapable, by reason of their grossness and vulgarity, of suffering in a"
"spiritual sense, were immune from the misery caused by the war and yet"
it was they above all others upon whose support the continuance of the
war depended.
This was the terrible fatality. The more a man suffered from the war the
smaller was his control over it.
"Everywhere, those who deserved to suffer did not suffer and those who"
"gradually, very gradually he become conscious that HE WAS NOT"
"ALONE,--another besides himself was in the church,--another, whom it"
was necessary for him to see!
"He could not tell how he first grew to be certain of this,--but he was"
"soon so completely possessed by the idea, that for a moment he dared"
"not raise his eyes, or move! Some invincible force held him there"
"spell-bound, yet trembling in every limb,--and while he thus waited"
"hesitatingly, the great organ woke up in a glory of tuneful"
"utterance,--wave after wave of richest harmony rolled through the"
"stately aisles and ... ""Kyrie eleison! Kyrie eleison!"" rang forth in"
"loud, full, and golden-toned chorus!"
"Lifting his head, he stared wonderingly around him; not a living"
creature was visible in all the spacious width and length of the
"cathedral! His lips parted,--he felt as though he could scarcely"
"breathe,--strong shudders ran through him, and he was penetrated by a"
"pleasing terror that was almost a physical pang,--an agonized"
"entrancement, like death or the desire of love! Presently, mastering"
"himself by a determined effort, he advanced steadily with the absorbed"
air of one who is drawn along by magnetic power ... steadily and slowly
"up the nave, ... and as he went, the music surged more tumultuously"
"among the vaulted arches,--there was a faint echo afar off, as of"
tinkling crystal bells; and at each onward step he gained a new access
"of courage, strength, firmness, and untrammelled ease, till every"
"timorous doubt and fear had fled away, and he stood directly in front"
"of the altar railing, gazing at the enshrined Cross, and seeing for the"
moment nothing save that Divine Symbol alone. And still the organ
"played, and still the voices sang,--he knew these sounds were not of"
"earth, and he also knew that they were intended to convey a meaning to"
"him,--but WHAT meaning?"
"from Genoa, in 1846, Dickens says, ""If I were a Swiss, with a hundred"
"thousand pounds, I would be as steady against the Catholic canons and"
the propagation of Jesuitism as any Radical among them; believing the
dissemination of Catholicity to be the most horrible means of political
"and social degradation left in the world."""
"In connection with Dickens' remark about Ireland, we may quote the"
"remarkable statement of Mr. Michael McCarthy, himself a Roman Catholic,"
"in his book, _Five Years in Ireland_, pp. 65 and 66, where, after"
describing the welcome of the Belfast Corporation to Lord Cadogan on
"his first visit, in 1895, to the Protestant North of Ireland, and"
their glowing statements about the peaceful and prosperous condition
"of their city and district, he contrasts this happy condition with"
"the unhappy state of the ""rest of Ireland,"" meaning by that the"
"Roman Catholic parts. ""In the rest of Ireland there is no social or"
industrial progress to record. The man who would say of it that it
"was 'progressing and prospering,' or that 'its work people were fully"
"employed,' or that there existed 'a continued development of its"
"industries,' or that its towns 'had increased in value and population,'"
would be set down as a madman. It is in this seven-eighths of Ireland
that the growing and great organization of the Catholic Church has
"taken root."""
"Mr. Gladstone, in an article on ""Italy and her Church,"" in the _Church"
"Quarterly Review_ for October, 1875, says: ""Profligacy, corruption and"
"ambition, continued for ages, unitedly and severally, their destructive"
"work upon the country, through the Curia and the papal chair; and in"
doing it they of course have heavily tainted the faith of which that
"chair was the guardian."" Elsewhere he says, ""There has never been any"
"more cunning blade devised against the freedom, the virtue and the"
"happiness of a people than Romanism."""
imagination by linking her life finally with his?--It is a perfectly
simple explanation of what some credulous souls might be inclined to
"consider a mystery,--and let the dear, wise, oracular people who cannot"
"admit any mystery in anything, and who love to trace all seeming"
"miracles to clever imposture, accept this elucidation by all"
"means,--they will be able to fit every incident of the story into such"
"an hypothesis, with most admirable and consecutive neatness! Al-Kyris"
"was truly a Vision,--the rest was,--What? Merely the working of a"
poetic imagination under mesmeric influence!
"So be it! The Poet knows the truth,--but what are Poets? Only the"
"Prophets and Seers! Only the Eyes of Time, which clearly behold"
"Heaven's Fact beyond this world's Fable. Let them sing if they choose,"
"and we will hear them in our idle hours,--we will give them a little of"
"our gold,--a little of our grudging praise, together with much of our"
private practical contempt and misprisal! So say the unthinking and
"foolish--so will they ever say,--and hence it is, that though the fame"
"of Theos Alwyn widens year by year, and his sweet clarion harp of Song"
"rings loud warning, promise, hope, and consolation above the noisy"
"tumult of the whirling age, people listen to him merely in vague"
"wonderment and awe, doubting his prophet utterance, and loth to put"
"away their sin. But he, never weary in well-doing, works on, ... ever"
"regardless of Self, caring nothing for Fame, but giving all the riches"
"of his thought for Love. Clear, grand, pure, and musical, his writings"
"fill the time with hope and passionate faith and courage,--his"
"inspiration fails not, and can never fail, since Edris is his fount of"
"ecstasy,--his name, made glorious by God's blessing, shall never, as in"
"his perished Past, be again forgotten!"
"And what of Edris? What of the ""Flower-crowned Wonder"" of the Field of"
"Ardath, strayed for a while out of her native Heaven? Does the world"
"know her marvellous origin? Perhaps the mystic Heliobas knows,--perhaps"
in the course of a few days he became a raving lunatic.
"Often the keepers, although only condemned to imprisonment for a"
"certain period at a time, have to tolerate a longer stay, owing to"
the relief-boat being unable to approach them. In some instances the
delay may run into five weeks or more. During the winter the relief of
"the Eddystone, Longships, Wolf, Fastnet, Skerryvore, and Dhu-Heartach"
lights is always a matter of extreme uncertainty. Although the men
"have to provide themselves with supplies, a reserve is maintained at"
the station by the authorities for such emergencies. Even some of the
land stations are not approachable readily. There is the Punta Gorda
"light-station on the Californian coast, the situation of which is wild"
"and forbidding. There is a landing about eight miles above the station,"
"but it is extremely precarious. Still, unless a certain element of risk"
"is accepted in coming ashore here, it is necessary to face a tramp or"
stage journey of nearly fifty miles across country in order to gain the
lighthouse.
"The lighthouses in the Red Sea are, perhaps, among the most unenviable"
"and trying in the world. This stretch of water, lying between two"
"blistered coasts of sand, is no more or less than an oven, where even"
the strongest constitution finds it difficult to hold out for long.
"Moreover, the absence of civilization, owing to the extreme aridity of"
"the country, renders the life exceptionally depressing. In the summer"
the heat is wellnigh intolerable. The thermometer hovers between 95°
"and 110° F. in the shade throughout the twenty-four hours, so that"
night brings no relief to the oppressiveness.
"At some of the stations the men seek a little diversion, and"
"incidentally add occasionally to their pocket-money, by shark-catching,"
"which is a tolerably profitable pursuit, since these waters are thickly"
infested with this fish. The jawbone and backbone invariably find ready
"situation as a hall porter or waiter, but I can see that you ought to"
"be a soldier in the army, because you are no fool, are patient and"
"understand discipline. Life shuffles us like cards, you see, and it is"
"only accidentally, and only for a time, that we fall into our own"
"places!"""
Such farewell speeches often served as a preface to the continuation of
"their acquaintance, which again began with drinking and went so far"
that the client would spend his last farthing.  Then the Captain would
"stand him treat, and they would drink all they had."
A repetition of similar doings did not affect in the least the good
relations of the parties.
The teacher mentioned by the Captain was another of those customers who
were thus reformed only in order that they should sin again.  Thanks to
"his intellect, he was the nearest in rank to the Captain, and this was"
"probably the cause of his falling so low as dosshouse life, and of his"
inability to rise again.  It was only with him that Aristid Kuvalda
could philosophise with the certainty of being understood.  He valued
"this, and when the reformed teacher prepared to leave the dosshouse in"
"order to get a corner in town for himself, then Aristid Kuvalda"
"accompanied him so sorrowfully and sadly that it ended, as a rule, in"
their both getting drunk and spending all their money.  Probably
Kuvalda arranged the matter intentionally so that the teacher could not
"leave the dosshouse, though he desired to do so with all his heart."
"Was it possible for Aristid Kuvalda, a nobleman (as was evident from"
"his speeches), one who was accustomed to think, though the turn of fate"
"may have changed his position, was it possible for him not to desire to"
have close to him a man like himself?  We can pity our own faults in
others.
"of German-Jewish or Dutch-Jewish descent, who in the present"
generation had become Catholic Christians as it ranged them with the
"best people. They were worthy and wealthy Belgian citizens, but"
presumably would not have deeply regretted a change in the political
"destinies of Belgium, provided international finance was not"
"adversely affected. There were also a few Belgian Socialists--a few,"
"but enough--who took posts under the German provisional government,"
on the plea that until you could be purely socialistic it did not
matter under what flag you drew your salary.
"Von Giesselin was most benevolently intentioned, in reality a"
"kind-hearted man, a sentimentalist. Not quite prepared to go to the"
"stake himself in place of any other victim of Prussian cruelty, but"
ready to make some effort to soften hardships and reduce sentences.
"(There were others like him--Saxon, Thuringian, Hanoverian,"
Württembergisch--or the German occupation of Belgium might have
"ended in a vast Sicilian Vespers, a boiling-over of a maddened"
"people reckless at last of whether they died or not, so long as they"
slew their oppressors.) He hoped through the pieces played at the
"theatres and through his censored, subsidized press to bring the"
"Belgians round to a reasonable frame of mind, to a toleration of"
existence under the German Empire. But his efforts brought down on
him the unsparing ridicule of the Parisian-minded Bruxellois. They
were prompt to detect his attempts to modify the text of French
"operettas so that these, while delighting the lovers of light music,"
need not at the same time excite a military spirit or convey the
least allusion of an impertinent or contemptuous kind towards the
Central Powers. Thus the couplets
"""Dans le service de l'Autriche"
"Le militaire n'est pas riche"""
Panamanian farmer will never incur the scriptural curse laid upon them
"that lay field unto field. He farms just enough for his daily needs, no"
more. The ambition that leads our northern farmer to always covet the
lands on the other side of his boundary fence does not operate in
"Panama. One reason is, of course, the aggressiveness of the jungle."
"Stubborn to clear away, it is determined in its efforts to regain the"
land from which it has been ousted. Such a thing as allowing a field to
lie fallow for two or three years is unknown in Panama. There would be
no field visible for the new jungle growth.
[Illustration: A FORD NEAR ANCON]
"Agriculture therefore is conducted in a small way only, except for the"
great corporations that have just begun the exploitation of Panama.
Whether the country affords a hopeful field for the individual settler
is at least doubtful. Its climate is excellent. The days are warm but
never scorchingly hot as are customary in Washington and frequent in New
York. The nights are cool. From December to May a steady trade wind
"blows over the Isthmus from north to south, carrying away the clouds so"
"that there is no rain. In this dry season the fruits mature, so that it"
corresponds to the northern summer; on the other hand such vegetation as
"sheds its leaves, or dies down annually, does so at this season, giving"
it a seeming correspondence to the northern winter. In a temperature
"sense there is neither summer nor winter, and the variation of the"
thermometer is within narrow limits. The highest temperature in years at
"Culebra, a typical inland point, was 96 degrees; the lowest 61."
The list of natural products of the Isthmus is impressive in its length
"and variety, but for most of them even the home demand is not met or"
supplied by the production. Only where some stimulating force from the
"outside has intervened, like the United Fruit Company with the banana,"
has production been brought up to anything like its possibility. In the
hospitals and also among the brave wives of the soldiers so
fascinating that from the New Year till early June I let all social
"duties slip, so much so that I had a nervous breakdown in June, and"
since then have had to go very slow.
We had a splendid time at our seaside cottage at Negishi this
"afternoon, any amount of our dear brown soldiers round us. There"
are five hundred quartered in that fishing village just now; they
"were resting, bathing, boating, washing their clothes or cooking"
"their chow, but never a rude word or an uncouth action; no"
"rowdyism, but all as civil, quiet, good-tempered, and alert as"
possible; they are a marvel; and my children go in and out among
"them and love them, like I do! I could _kill_ white idiots when I"
hear them speak of those fine fellows as 'an inferior race.' Ye
"gods! 'inferior' with never a camp follower to their name, and"
rapine unknown even after the fiercest fight! What European race
can show a record like that? I wish I could be home for six months
and tell what the soldiers and their wives are--what miracles of
cheerful patience and manly dignity the wounded men are as they lie
"hacked and maimed, sometimes till almost all semblance of manhood"
"is gone, yet never a murmur does any one hear from their lips--no,"
"not if they are armless, legless, and even _blind_. And you would"
not dare condole with them! They say and believe they 'are greatly
"honoured.' When they embrace Christianity, they shame the brightest"
"Christian among us, and I come away from visiting the hospitals"
"feeling so small, so humble, yet at peace with all the world. We"
"have very, very much to learn from this great people."
"This second extract, about a soldier's wife, may come home to your"
readers even more:--
I allow two families a small sum of money every week. One case is
"billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling"
"with death, and then the squall had passed."
"""Heaven be praised!"" said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going"
"to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."""
"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there"
"is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as"
what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
"greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the"
"whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them"
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
"billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last"
"billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now"
"there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the"
"boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on"
the whole ship.
The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the
"preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she"
"would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck."
"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet"
"by billet, and no two billets at once. And when the last billet of wood"
"fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard,"
"and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood,"
as far as eye could reach.
"When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of"
"writing to their wives. ""That is something you might just as well let"
"be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."""
"anything, risk anything, and suffer anything to shield her from the"
"filthy Germans, I rejoice that she has in her service such supremely"
efficient guardians as this most wickedly unscrupulous Dawson. There
"is, at any rate, not a trace of our English muddle about him."""
"""Ours is a righteous cause,"" cried poor Cary desperately. ""We are"
"fighting for right against wrong, for defence against aggression, for"
civilisation against utter barbarism. We are by instinct clean
"fighters. If in the stress of conflict we stoop to foul methods, can"
we ever wash away the filth of them from our souls? We shall stand
before the world nakedly confessed as the nation of hypocrites we have
"always been declared to be."""
"""Cary,"" I said, ""you make me tired. We cannot be too thankful that we"
"possess Dawsons to counterplot against the Germans, and that"
personally we are in no way responsible for the morality of their
methods. Come off the roof and get back to this most interesting
"affair of the _Antinous_. I presume one of Dawson's men was working,"
"unknown to his fellows, with the care and maintenance party, and"
"another, equally unknown, with the engineers who were busy upon the"
gearing of the turbines. Many of the regular ship's officers and men
would also have been on board. Had our remarkable friend his agents
among them too? Everything is possible with Dawson; I should not be
"surprised to hear that he had police officers in the Fleet flagship."""
"""You are almost right. One of his men, a temporary petty officer of"
"R.N.V.R., was certainly on board, and he tells me that down in the"
engine room was another--a civilian fitter. They were both first-class
"men. The electric wires, as you know, are carried about the ship under"
"the deck beams, where they are accessible for examination and repairs."
"They are coiled in cables from which wires are led to the switch room,"
"and thence to all parts of the ship. There are thousands of wires, and"
"upon Conviction to be fined, in the Discretion of the Court, any Sum not"
"exceeding Five hundred Pounds, and to suffer Imprisonment for such Time,"
"not exceeding One Year, as the Court may adjudge."

"nursing, not to speak of some excellent whisky that she happened to have"
"stored away in her cabin, had pulled him through. With a sigh of relief"
she threw herself down on the rug for a much-needed rest.
"The man woke just before the sun rose. His first thought, that he was"
"home in the foothills, was dissipated by the sight of the snow ranges."
"Through the window of the cabin, as far as the eye could see, nothing of"
"green was visible. Snow was everywhere; everything was white, save at"
the eastern horizon where silver was fast changing into rose and rose to
a fiery red as the fast-rising sun sent its shafts over the snow-coated
mountains.
And now there came to him a full realisation of what had happened and
"where he was. To his amazement, though, he was almost without pain. That"
"his wound had been dressed he was, of course, well aware for when he"
attempted to draw back still further the curtain at the window the
"movement strained the tight bandage, and he was instantly made conscious"
of a twinge of pain.
"Nevertheless, he persevered, for he wisely decided that it would be well"
"to reconnoitre, to familiarise himself, as much as possible, with the"
lay of the land and find out whether the trail that he had followed to
"reach the cabin which, he recalled, was perched high up above a ravine,"
was the only means of communication with the valley below. It was a
"useless precaution, for the snow would have wholly obliterated any such"
"trail had there been one and, soon realising the fact, he fell back"
exhausted by his effort on the pillows.
"A half hour passed and the man began to grow restless. He had, of"
"course, no idea whatever of the length of time he had been in the cabin,"
and he knew that he must be thinking of an immediate escape. In
"desperation, he tried to get out of bed, but the task was beyond his"
"Carlist partisanship and military rank. Moreover, he had acquired, in"
"some unexplained way, a leathern Montera cap, a short many-buttoned"
"jacket, a flapped waistcoat of red plush, and leathern small-clothes of"
the same sort as those worn by La Giralda. Yet withal there remained
"something very remarkable about him. His great height, his angular"
"build, the grim humour of his mouth, the beady blackness of eyes which"
"twinkled with a fleck of fire in each, as a star might be reflected in a"
deep well on a moonless night--these all gave him a certain distinction
in a country of brick-dusty men of solemn exterior and rare speech.
"Also there was something indescribably daring about the man, his air and"
carriage. There was the swagger as of a famous _matador_ about the way
he carried himself. He gave a cock to his plain countryman's cap which
betokened one of a race at once quicker and more gay--more passionate
and more dangerous than the grave and dignified inhabitants of Old
Castile through whose country they were presently journeying.
"As Cardono and La Giralda departed out of the camp, the Sergeant driving"
before him a donkey which he had picked up the night before wandering by
"the wayside, El Sarria looked after them with a sardonic smile which"
"slowly melted from his face, leaving only the giant's usual placid good"
nature apparent on the surface. The mere knowledge that Dolóres was
alive and true to him seemed to have changed the hunted and desperate
outlaw almost beyond recognition.
"""Why do you smile, El Sarria?"" said Concha, who stood near by, as the"
"outlaw slowly rolled and lighted a _cigarrillo_. ""You do not love this"
"Sergeant. You do not think he is a man to be trusted?"""
"El Sarria shrugged his shoulders, and slowly exhaled the first long"
breathing of smoke through his nostrils.
the project was never abandoned during four hundred years. At last it
"was secured by stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something."
"The commander of the Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the"
"bones, separated them, and packed them in vessels filled with lard. The"
religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to abhor anything in the nature
"of pork, and so when the Christian was stopped at the gate of the city,"
"they only glanced once into the precious baskets, then turned up their"
"noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried in"
"the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years"
"to receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were"
secured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if
"those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a"
"dream, and its foundation be buried forever in the unremembering sea."""
[Sidenote: The Gift of Leo XIII. to London.]
More recently I had read of what has been well called the burlesque
"enacted at Arundel Castle no longer ago than in July, 1902, in which"
"the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Vaughan, and many lesser ornaments and"
"dignitaries of the Romish Church, took part."
"""Pope Leo XIII., in order to show his 'good-will to England,'"
sent from Rome the remains of St. Edmund to garnish the new Roman
"Catholic cathedral at Westminster. It was an appropriate gift, for"
such buildings are usually garnished with 'dead men's bones and all
"uncleanness.' But as the cathedral is not yet finished, as a further"
"token of good-will, the relics were committed to the care of no less"
a personage than the Earl Marshal of England. They arrived at Arundel
"on the evening of July 25th, and were placed for the night in Fitzalen"
"Chapel. The next morning the whole castle was astir betimes, for the"
"great event of the day, the transference of the bones to the castle"
"chapel, was to take place. This was accomplished in a solemn and"
where I found Frances and Bettina luxuriating in tearful sympathy.
"I walked home with Bettina, and she invited me to go to her parlor to"
"have a cup of tea. To see Bettina boil the tea (steep it or draw it, she"
said was the proper phrase) was as pretty a sight as one could wish to
"behold, and when she poured it out in thin china cups, handing one to"
"me and taking one herself, her pride in following the fashion of modish"
ladies was as touching as it was simple and beautiful. It was almost more
"than my feeble resolutions could withstand, so when I was about to leave"
"I had a great battle with myself and was defeated, for I seized her"
"hands, and although I said nothing, she knew what was in my mind, so she"
"hung her head, murmuring:--"
"""If you are willing to make me more unhappy than I am."""
"""Not for the world, Bettina,"" I answered, rallying against myself."
"""Goodnight."""
"""Good night. Now I know you are my friend,"" she answered softly, holding"
"my hands for a moment, then dropping them suddenly and turning from me."
"I have refrained from speaking of Mary Hamilton of late, partly because"
"I did not see her frequently at this time, and partly because the shame I"
felt at the time of which I am now writing comes surging over me whenever
I touch upon the subject. Not that I did anything of which I need be
"ashamed, but because I remember so vividly my motives and desires that"
"the old sensations return, even at this distant day, as a perfume, a"
"strain of music, the soft balminess of spring, or the sharp bite of"
"winter's frost may recall a moment of the past, and set the heart"
throbbing or still it as of yore.
"After leaving Bettina, I went back to Whitehall and dressed for a ball"
atheistic rhetoric has been placarded at the cost of the State in
every commune throughout France.
"We may consider, then, if there be any method by which the man who"
"does not read theological or scientific or philosophical books, the"
"man who has left off going to church, or gets no help from the"
"average sermon, the man who has no reverence for mere authority, may"
be induced to consider the Christian Revelation as offering him a key
to those riddles of life which his civic responsibilities are
perpetually propounding.
Remember that his present condition may be roughly described as
consisting of religious haziness and moral laziness. The moral
laziness is being subjected to a series of rough shocks. He _must_
make up his mind about some questions of morality. The relation of the
"sexes, the duties of property, the treatment of the subject savage,"
"the survival of the unfit, the ethics of commerce, the control of the"
"sale of alcohol, the education of children, these things he has to"
"decide and he will ultimately decide. But he is at present perplexed,"
and his religious haziness is the reason of his perplexity. He perhaps
"has not reached the conclusion of his contemporary in France, but he"
is on the way to it. Those heavenly lights which M. Viviani declares
that his Government has extinguished still shine faintly for men in
"England, though the mists obscure them."
"Can we get men to look upwards for light, and instead of cursing the"
"ancient creed in a confused commination, to take Arthur Clough’s"
advice--
“Ah! yet consider it again.”
"I believe that there is a method, and as I mention it I am prepared"
"PHILLIPS, JOHN."
"A carpenter by trade, he sailed from the West Country for Newfoundland in"
a ship that was captured by the pirate Anstis in the _Good Fortune_.
"Phillips soon became reconciled to the life of a pirate, and, being a"
"brisk fellow, he was appointed carpenter to the ship. Returning to England"
"he soon found it necessary to quit the country again, and he shipped"
himself on board a vessel at Topsham for Newfoundland. On arriving at
"Peter Harbour he ran away, and hired himself as a splitter to the"
Newfoundland cod fishery.
"On the night of August 29th, 1723, with four others, he stole a vessel in"
the harbour and sailed away. Phillips was chosen captain. Articles were
"now drawn up and were sworn to upon a hatchet, because no Bible could be"
"found on board. Amongst other laws was the punishment of ""40 stripes"
"lacking one, known as Moses's law, to be afflicted for striking a"
"fellow-pirate."" The last law of the nine casts a curious light on these"
"murderers; it runs: ""If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that"
"Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer"
"present Death."" The pirates, fortified by these laws, met with instant"
"success, taking several fishing vessels, from which they augmented their"
small crew by the addition of several likely and brisk seamen. Amongst
these they had the good fortune to take prisoner an old pirate called John
"Rose Archer, who had served his pirate apprenticeship under the able"
"tuition of the famous Blackbeard, and who they at once promoted to be"
"quartermaster. This quick promotion caused trouble afterwards, for some of"
"the original crew, particularly carpenter Fern, resented it. The pirates"
"next sailed to Barbadoes, that happy hunting ground, but for three months"
"never a sail did they meet with, so that they were almost starving for"
"want of provisions, being reduced to a pound of dried meat a day amongst"
"woods yet, but a good beginning always means a lot, and he had no word"
to say against this start-off.
"Presently the various driving crews appeared, wet to the skin from the"
"waist down, and ravenously hungry. The drying racks were swiftly"
"steaming with the soggy garments, and the men fell to upon their supper"
without a second’s delay. There was little conversation--they were too
busy for that; but Bainbridge noticed with satisfaction that a certain
element of good-tempered raillery seemed to prevail. Evidently the crowd
as a whole bore no grudge against the man who had given them such a
"tongue-lashing that morning. In fact, if one could judge from their"
"manner toward their boss, they thought a lot more of him for having done"
so.
"Next day all hands did even better, and nightfall found them at the"
"inlet of Loon Lake, with the drive before them. Bob could not understand"
it. All day he had been expecting some disagreeable happening of a
nature to retard their progress which could be laid at the door of the
trust. When it did not come he was almost disappointed. It was
impossible to believe that Crane had given up so easily; he was not that
"sort. He would explode a bombshell of some sort soon, and the longer he"
delayed the more deadly was likely to be the nature of his attack.
"However, there was nothing to be gained in discounting the future, nor"
time to spare for fretting over the unknown. Bob was far too busy during
the daylight hours even to think of Crane or his satellites. It was a
ticklish job to get the drive across even so small a body of water as
"the so-called lake, and it took one entire day and the better part of"
"another. It was done without mishap, however, and Bainbridge was just"
congratulating himself on having got safely over one of the most
disagreeable bits of the entire distance when Jerry Calker approached
him as he stood watching the last few logs bob slowly out of the lake
Anglicans alike. Your Heaven will be a small place. From Southampton I
went to the torpedo training-ship _Vernon_. Again I had no difficulty.
I was a workman of skill and intelligence. I was there for more than
"two years, learning all your secrets, and storing them in my mind for"
the benefit of my own Service at home.
It was at Portsmouth that there came to me the great temptation of my
"life, for I fell in love, not as you colder people do, but as a"
"Latin of the warm South. She was an English girl of good, if"
"undistinguished, family. Though in my hours of duty I belonged to that"
"you call the 'working classes,' I was well off, and lived in private"
"the life of my own class. I had double the pay of my rank, an"
"allowance from my father, and my wages, which were not small. There"
were many English families in Portsmouth and Southsea who were
"graciously pleased to recognise that John Trehayne, trade unionist,"
"and weekly wage-earning workman, was a gentleman by birth and"
breeding. In any foreign port I should have been under police
supervision as a person eminently to be suspected; in Portsmouth I was
accepted without question for what I gave myself out to be--a
gentleman who wished to learn his business from the bottom upwards. I
will say nothing of the lady of my heart except that I loved her
"passionately, and should have married her--aye, and become an"
"Englishman in fact, casting off my own, country--if War had not blown"
"my ignoble plans to shatters. There was nothing ignoble in my love,"
"for she was a queen among women, but in myself for permitting the hot"
blood of youth to blind my eyes to the duty claimed of me by my
"country. When war became imminent, I was not recalled, as I had hoped"
"to be, since I wished to fight afloat as became my rank and family. I"
was ordered to take such steps as most effectively aided me to observe
"the English plans and preparations, and to report when possible to"
"Vienna. In other words, I was ordered to act in your midst as a"
special intelligence officer--what you would call a Spy. It was an
"""We must take the rough and the smooth of life as we find it,"" answered"
"the other.  ""I have had my moments of rebellion—I have them still; but I"
seek the consolations of philosophy; and I have never yet wanted for
bread or shelter.  But there be times when the future looks dark before
"me.  Those who remember me, and pity my misfortunes, drop away one by"
one.  I lacked not for patrons at the first. When I could not longer
"tread the boards, I was ofttimes engaged to make men laugh or weep at"
"some gay rout at a nobleman’s house.  Then, too, my jests and quips were"
"in request at gay supper-parties, and I was paid to set the table in a"
"roar, which in all sooth was not difficult when the wine-bottle was"
"going round and round.  Oh, I knew gay times for many a year after my"
stage career closed. But patrons have died off one by one.  I am more
"crippled than I was, and the young wits are pushing to the front, whilst"
the Old Lion has been crowded out.  My pen still serves me in a measure.
"I can turn an epigram, or write a couplet, or even make shift to pen a"
"sonnet that lacks not the true ring.  Grist yet comes to the mill, but"
more and more slowly.  There come moments when I wonder what will be the
"end of the Old Lion’s career—the poorhouse, or a death by slow"
"starvation in some garret!"""
"""No, no,"" cried Grey almost fiercely; ""that would be shame indeed."
"Surely, if nothing better turn up, there must be places of refuge for"
"fallen genius. Have not almshouses been built, again and again, by the"
"well-disposed for such men as sickness has laid aside?  You smile, but"
"in sooth it is so."""
"""Ay, and how many are there to claim the benefits of pious founders?"
"Yet no matter.  I brought you not here to talk of my troubles, but of"
"yours.  That romance of which you speak—"""
"""It would seem the world cares little for such things.  I did hear the"
"same tale everywhere.  Was it a pamphlet I had to give them, a lampoon"
"in the intellectual life of a Nation, that of spontaneous outflow, that"
giving out of its life by which the world is enriched. When the Nation
"has lost this power, when it merely receives, but cannot give out, then"
"its healthy life is over, and it sinks into a degenerate existence which"
is purely parasitic.
HOW INDIA CAN TEACH
"How can our Nation give out of the fulness of the life that is in it,"
and how can a new Indian University help in the realisation of this
object? It is clear that its power of directing and inspiring will
depend on its world status. This can be secured to it by no artificial
"means, nor by any strength in the past; and what is the weakness that"
has been paralysing her activities for the accomplishment of any great
"scientific work? There must be two different elements, and these must be"
evenly balanced. Any excess of either will injure it.
HOW TO SECURE THIS STATUS
This world status can only be won by the intrinsic value of the great
contributions to be made by its own Indian scholars for the advancement
of the world's knowledge. To be organic and vital our new University
"must stand primarily for self-expression, and for winning for India a"
place she has lost. Knowledge is never the exclusive possession of any
"particular race, nor does it recognise geographical limitations. The"
"whole world is interdependent, and a constant stream of thought had been"
carried out throughout the ages enriching the common heritage of
mankind. Although science was neither of the East nor of the West but
"international, certain aspects of it gained richness by reason of their"
place of origin.
"""Come with us,"" they cried; ""we are here for the greatest plunder ever"
"taken or dreamed of among the Romany----"""
"""Hush, I command you,"" cried the elder man. ""José Maria of Ronda this"
"man may be, but we are _Gitanos_ of the North, and need not a man from"
"Andalucia to lead us, even if he carry a scarlet cravat about his neck"
"for a credential!"""
The Sergeant nodded approval of this sentiment and addressed the old
"gipsy in deep Romany, to which he listened with respect, and answered in"
"a milder tone, shaking his head meanwhile."
"""I have indeed heard such sayings from my mother,"" he said, ""and I"
gather your meaning; but we _Gitanos_ of the North have mingled too much
with the outlander and the foreigner to have preserved the ancient
purity of speech. But in craft and deed I wot well we are to the full as
"good Roms as ever."""
By this time it was clear to the Sergeant that the old man was jealous
of his leadership; and as he himself was by no means desirous of taking
"part in a midnight raid against a plague-stricken town, he proceeded to"
"make it clear that, being on his way to his own country of Andalucia and"
had been led aside by the gipsy cryptograms he had observed by the
wayside and the casual greeting of the crook-backed imp of the village.
"Upon this the old man sat down beside Sergeant Cardono, or, as his new"
"friends knew him to be, José Maria the brigand. He did not talk about"
the intended attack as the Sergeant hoped he would. Being impressed by
"the greatness of his guest, he entered into a minute catalogue of the"
"captures he had made, the men he had slain as recorded on the butt of"
"his gun or the haft of his knife, and the cargoes he had successfully"
"severe. Master Bailey's assistance is next requisitioned, and him friend"
"Diccon cannot overreach. The whole truth coming out, Diccon is required"
to kneel and apologize. In doing so he gives Hodge a slap which elicits
"from that worthy a yell of pain. But it is a wholesome pang, for it"
finds the needle no further away than in the seat of Hodge's breeches.
If we compare this play with _Ralph Roister Doister_ three ideas will
"occur: first, that we have made no advance; second, that, in giving the"
"preference to rough country folk, the author has deliberately abandoned"
the higher standard of refinement in language and action set in Udall's
"major scenes; third, that whereas the earlier work bases its comedy on"
"character, educing the amusing scenes from the clash of vanity,"
"constancy and mischief, the later play relies for its comic effects on"
situations brought about by mischief alone. These are three rather heavy
counts against the younger rival. But in the other scale may be placed a
very fair claim to greater naturalness. Taking the scenes and characters
"in turn, mischief-maker, churchman and all, there is none so open to the"
"charge of being impossible, and therefore farcical, as the battle"
"between the forces of Ralph and Dame Custance, or the incredibly"
self-deceived Ralph himself. In accompanying Ralph through his
adventures we seem to be moving through a fantastic world in which Sir
"Andrew Aguecheek and Malvolio might feel at home; but with Dame Chat,"
Gammer Gurton and Hodge we feel the solid earth beneath our feet and
around us the strong air which nourished the peasantry and yeomen of
Tudor England.
The first extract is a verse from this comedy's one and famous song; the
"second is taken from Act I, Scene 4."

"I cannot eat but little meat,"
"prompted, she drew up a chair and prepared to pass the rest of the night"
in watching by his side.
For an hour or so he slept the sleep of unconsciousness. In the room not
"a sound could be heard, but outside the storm still roared and raged. It"
was anything but an easy or cheerful situation: Here she was alone with
"a wounded, if not dying, man; and she well knew that, unless there came"
"an abatement in the fury of the storm, it might be days before anyone"
"could climb the mountain. True, the Indians were not far off, but like"
as not they would remain in their wigwam until the sun came forth again.
"In the matter of food there was a scant supply, but probably enough to"
tide them over until communication could be had with The Polka.
"For three days she watched over him, and all the time the storm"
"continued. On the third day he became delirious, and that was the night"
of her torture. Despite a feeling that she was taking an unfair
"advantage of him, the Girl strained her ears to catch a name which, in"
"his delirium, was constantly on his lips; but she could not make it out."
"All that she knew was that it was not her name that he spoke, and it"
"pained her. She had given him absolute faith and trust and, already, she"
was overwhelmed with the fierce flames of jealousy. It was a new
"sensation, this being jealous of anyone, and it called forth a"
passionate resentment. In such moments she would rise and flee to the
other end of the room until the whispered endearments had ceased. Then
she would draw near again with flushes of shame on her cheeks for having
"heeded the sayings of an irresponsible person, and she would take his"
"head in her lap and, caressing him the while, would put cold towels on"
his heated brow.
"Dawn of the fourth day saw the Girl still pale and anxious, though"
despair had entirely left her; for the storm was over and colour and
speech had come back to the man early that morning. Love and good
The dozen men who had been slinging freight on the dock hastened up the
"gang-plank or climbed the fenders, while the signal-man clung to the"
"lifting tackle, and, at the piping cry of his whistle, was swung aloft"
out of the very arms of the rioters.
"Above, on the flying bridge, Captain Peasley was bellowing orders; a"
quartermaster was running up the iron steps to the pilot-house; on deck
the sailors were fighting their way to their posts through the ranks of
the raging fishermen and the shrieking confusion of the Orientals; the
"last men aboard, with a ""Heave Ho!"" in unison, slid the gang-plank"
"upward and out of reach. The neighboring roofs, lately so black, were"
"emptying now, the onlookers hastening to join in the attack."
Big George alone remained upon the wharf. As he saw the rush coming he
had ordered his men to abandon their load; then he ran to the
"after-mooring, and, taking slack from a deck hand, cast it off. Back up"
"the dock he went to the forward hawser, where, at a signal, he did the"
"same, moving, toward the last, without excessive hurry, as if in a"
"spirit of bravado. The ship was clear, and he had not cut a hawser. He"
had done his work; all but a ton or two of the cargo was stowed. There
was no longer cause for delay.
"""Get aboard! Are you mad?"" Emerson shouted, but the cry never reached"
"him. Back he came slowly, in front of the press, secure in his"
"tremendous strength, defiance in his every move, a smouldering"
challenge in his eyes; and noting that gigantic frame with its
"square-hewn, flaming face, not one of his enemies dared oppose him. But"
"as he passed they yapped and snarled and jostled at his heels, hungry"
to rend him and only lacking courage.
"As yet the ship, although throbbing to the first pulsations of her"
"engines, lay snug along the piling, but gradually her stern swung off"
this kind in the collection at the end of the book.[42]
"So far we have dealt only with the negative results of stories, but"
"there are more important effects, and I am persuaded that if we are"
"careful in our choice of stories, and artistic in our presentation"
"(so that the truth is framed, so to speak, in the memory), we can"
unconsciously correct evil tendencies in children which they only
recognise in themselves when they have already criticised them in
the characters of the story. I have sometimes been misunderstood on
"this point, therefore I should like to make it quite clear. I do"
_not_ mean that stories should take the place entirely of moral or
"direct teaching, but that on many occasions they could supplement"
"and strengthen moral teaching, because the dramatic appeal to the"
imagination is quicker than the moral appeal to the conscience. A child
will often resist the latter lest it should make him uncomfortable
or appeal to his personal sense of responsibility: it is often not in
"his power to resist the former, because it has taken possession of him"
before he is aware of it.
"As a concrete example, I offer three verses from a poem entitled “A"
"Ballad for a Boy,” written some twelve years ago by W. Cory, an Eton"
master. The whole poem is to be found in a book of poems known as
“Ionica” (published by George Allen and Co.).
"The poem describes a fight between two ships, the French ship"
_Téméraire_ and the English ship _Quebec_. The English ship was
"destroyed by fire. Farmer, the captain, was killed, and the officers"
taken prisoners:
"“They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;"
"And as the wounded captives passed, each Breton bowed the head."
"Then spoke the French lieutenant, 'Twas the fire that won, not we:"
Englishmen before Marlowe flung his flaming torch amongst them. To
"understand the story a slight introduction is necessary. Igerna, the"
"wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, was loved by King Uther, who foully"
slew her husband and so won her for himself. As a result of this union
"were born Arthur and Anne, who, in their youth, perpetuated the"
"inherited taint of sin by becoming the parents of a boy, Mordred."
"Afterwards Arthur married Guenevera, and some years later went to France"
on a long campaign of conquest. In his absence Mordred gained the love
"of Guenevera. The play begins with the contemplated return of Arthur,"
"glorious from victory, the object being to concentrate attention upon"
"the swift fall from glory and power to ruin and death. Guenevera, having"
"learnt to hate her husband, debates in her mind his death or hers,"
"finally deciding, however, to become a nun. Her interview with Mordred"
ends in his resolving to resist Arthur's landing. Unsuccessful in this
"attempt, and defeated in battle, he spurns all thought of submission,"
"challenging his father to a second conflict, in Cornwall. Arthur,"
"feeling that his sins have found him out, would gladly make peace; but,"
"stung by Mordred's defiance, he follows him into Cornwall. There both"
"armies are destroyed and Mordred is slain, though in his death he"
mortally wounds his father. After the battle his body is brought before
"Arthur, in whom the sight awakens yet more fiercely the pangs of"
remorse. The play closes immediately before Arthur's own mysterious
departure.
Here is all the material for a great tragedy. The point for beginning
"the story is well chosen, though in obvious imitation of _Agamemnon_."
"Attention is concentrated on the catastrophe, no alien element being"
admitted to detract from the melancholy effect. It is sought to
"intensify the gloom by recourse to Seneca's stage Ghost; thus, the"
departed spirit of the wronged Gorlois opens the play with horrid
"imprecations of evil upon the house of Uther, and, at the close, exults"
"in the fullness of his revenge. From his mouth, as well as from the lips"
Lord.”
"Indeed, it is our misfortune in England that Bishops are almost"
necessarily bad leaders. We are told when an election to the Papacy is
imminent that this or that Cardinal is in the list of “Papabili”--a
possible Pope--so in like manner we may almost select amongst the
undergraduates of Oxford and Cambridge our future diocesans. These are
"men clever, shrewd, and hard-working, of estimable private character,"
and not without some modest patrimony. Early entered in the race for
"preferment, ambitious, and yet, _mirabile dictu_, devout, they are"
"endowed first of all with the true qualification for episcopacy, a"
capacity for compromise and a pliant political mind. _Sic itur ad
"astra_ the excellent curate or tutor, the courteous and accomplished"
"chaplain to the Bishop, the eloquent canon and ecclesiastical courtier"
is consecrated and enthroned. Henceforward for the rest of his days he
"must hurry from his study table, crowded with correspondence, to his"
"confirmations, his diocesan society meetings, and his weary,"
humiliating attendance at the House of Lords. What wonder if Bishops
"discourage new ventures of faith, who have no time for thinking, no"
"time for reading, and perhaps, sometimes, too little opportunity for"
prayer!
And so we find them not unwilling to accommodate the Catholic Faith to
"the popular prejudice of the moment, acquiescing in an undogmatic,"
"undenominational, more or less Christian creed. Popularity becomes the"
"very breath of their nostrils, and they proceed to hide in an"
"appendix to the Prayer-book, the hymn _Quicunque vult_."
Yet the discerning can see that now is no time for keeping in the
background the great truths of religion. Already men are being
prepared in many ways to receive them.

individual hand’s strength as the might of the sea to the spite of some

"Yet, if the insignificance of thy little petty self irk thy conceit"
"at this moment, what of the scented, gloved, and dandified gentlemen"
who write the anarchic words that have led thy conceit to seek some
shabby fame in flinging a bomb amongst innocent people! What of them
whose lyric pens have pointed the way to the Uselessness of the old

to slay the drunken carter to thine own Egoism’s enrichment? Tsh! thou

"gütes leute"" and that all would go smoothly in time."
Nevertheless the next morning when she could take stock she found
nearly all the poultry except the pigeons had disappeared; and most
"of the apples, ripe and unripe, had vanished from the orchard trees."
"The female servants of the farm, however, came back; and finding no"
"violence was offered took up their work again. Two days afterwards,"
"von Giesselin sent Vivie into Brussels in his motor, with his"
"orderly to escort her, so that she might deposit her valuables at a"
"bank. She found Brussels, suburbs and city alike, swarming with"
"grey-uniformed soldiers, most of whom looked tired and despondent."
"Those who were on the march, thinking Vivie must be the wife of some"
"German officer of high rank, struck up a dismal chant from dry"
"throats with a refrain of ""Gloria, Viktoria, Hoch! Deutschland,"
"Hoch!"" At the bank the Belgian officials received her with"
deference. Apart from being the daughter of the well-to-do Mrs.
"Warren, she was English, and seemed to impose respect even on the"
"Germans. They took over her valuables, made out a receipt, and"
cashed a fairly large cheque in ready money. Vivie then ventured to
ask the bank clerk who had seen to her business if he had any news.
"Looking cautiously round, he said the rumours going through the town"
"were that the Queen of Holland, enraged that her Prince Consort"
"should have facilitated the crossing of Limburg by German armies,"
"had shot him dead with a revolver; that the Crown Prince of Germany,"
"despairing of a successful end of the War, had committed suicide at"
his father's feet; that the American Consul General in Brussels--to
"whom, by the bye, Vivie ought to report herself and her mother, in"
order to come under his protection--had notified General Sixt von
"Arnim, commanding the army in Brussels, that, _unless he vacated the"
"Belgian capital immediately_, England would bombard Hamburg and the"
United States would declare war on the Kaiser. Alluring stories like
these flitted through despairing Brussels during the first two
elevation of the main figures and intensifying of the catastrophe which
"tragic emotion demands. Unfortunately, from the start the author seems"
to have been obsessed with the notion that the familiar rant of Herod
"was peculiarly suited to his subject. In such a notion there lay, of"
"course, the half-truth that lofty thoughts and impassioned speech are"
"more befitting the sombre muse than the foolish chatter of clowns. But,"
"except where his own deliberately introduced mirth-makers are speaking,"
he will have nothing but pompous rhetoric from the lips of his
characters. His prologue begins his speech with the sounding line:
Who doth desire the trump of fame to sound unto the skies--
Virginius's wife makes her début upon the stage with this encouraging
remark to her companion:
"The pert and prickly prime of youth ought chastisement to have,"
"But thou, dear daughter, needest not, thyself doth show thee grave."
To which Virginia most becomingly answers:
"Refell your mind of mournful plaints, dear mother, rest your mind."
"After this every one feels that the wicked judge, Appius, has done no"
"more than his duty when he exclaims, at his entrance:"
The furrowed face of fortune's force my pinching pain doth move.
Virginius slays his daughter on the stage and serves her head up in a
"charger before Appius, who promptly bursts into a cataclysm of C's ('O"
"curst and cruel cankered churl, O carl unnatural'); but there is not a"
suggestion of the pathos noticed in _Cambyses_. Instead there is in one
"place a sort of frantic agitation, which the author doubtless thought"
"that of a young woman, under twenty years of age, who has a child"
"and an aged parent to keep, and her husband went to the war a few"
"weeks ago, leaving her penniless and on the verge of having another"
"baby. A few days ago, when I went to take her weekly money, she"
"refused to take it, saying she had got a little work to do and"
"could now manage without any help, as there were so many in much"
greater need of help than herself; and she would not take the
"money, though she was earning even less than I was allowing her."
_That_ is what I call a real heroine.
How many at work amongst our poor last winter could give such
"evidence to character as that?--I am, sir, yours, etc."

NOTE TO DIALOGUE VIII.
Before the preceding pages had been printed two events worth mentioning
here took place. One is the lamented death of Sir Henry Irving. The
other is the public discussion which took place under the auspices of
"the London Shakespeare League, on the best method of presenting"
Shakespeare's plays on the modern stage. On the latter subject perhaps I
may add a word. While in Japan the tendency is to introduce
"women-players into the company of male players, and improvement of"
"scenery is much sought after on European lines, both of which are due to"
"the occidental influence, it is curious to notice that exactly reverse"
"movements, namely the dispensing with the female players and the"
"returning back to the primitive simplicity of stage properties, are"
advocated in England by competent persons with regard to the
representation of Shakespeare. I extract below among others a passage of
the speech of Mr. Bernard Shaw on the occasion of the discussion
lemon peel on the cocktail of creation—such is the bride. Holy is the
wife; revered the mother; galliptious is the summer girl—but the bride
is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in
when man is married to mortality.
The car glided up the Golden Way. On the bridge of the great cruiser
"the captain stood, trumpeting the sights of the big city to his"
"passengers. Wide-mouthed and open-eared, they heard the sights of the"
"metropolis thundered forth to their eyes. Confused, delirious with"
"excitement and provincial longings, they tried to make ocular responses"
to the megaphonic ritual. In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals
they saw the home of the Vanderbilts; in the busy bulk of the Grand
"Central depot they viewed, wonderingly, the frugal cot of Russell Sage."
"Bidden to observe the highlands of the Hudson, they gaped,"
"unsuspecting, at the upturned mountains of a new-laid sewer. To many"
"the elevated railroad was the Rialto, on the stations of which"
uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets. And to this day
"in the outlying districts many have it that Chuck Connors, with his"
"hand on his heart, leads reform; and that but for the noble municipal"
"efforts of one Parkhurst, a district attorney, the notorious “Bishop”"
Potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the Bowery to the
Harlem River.
But I beg you to observe Mrs. James Williams—Hattie Chalmers that
"was—once the belle of Cloverdale. Pale-blue is the bride’s, if she"
will; and this colour she had honoured. Willingly had the moss rosebud
loaned to her cheeks of its pink—and as for the violet!—her eyes will
"do very well as they are, thank you. A useless strip of white chaf—oh,"
"no, he was guiding the auto car—of white chiffon—or perhaps it was"
"grenadine or tulle—was tied beneath her chin, pretending to hold her"
bonnet in place. But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the
work.
varying in strength. Aconitine often contains a considerable proportion
"of aconite and benzaconine, and so varies in activity, which is a great"
objection to the use of one of the most powerful drugs known.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₃₀ to ¹⁄₅ gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₂₀₀ to ¹⁄₁₀₀ gr."
subcutaneously.
"Actions of aconite, its preparations and derivative are anodynes and"
"sedatives, acting specially on the peripheral endings of the sensory"
"nerves, on the heart and on respiration. Aconite kills by respiratory"
arrest.
Its physiological actions as a cardiac and respiratory sedative renders
it a febrifuge; it is also diaphoretic and diuretic. It is prescribed in
"acute febrile conditions, and in the earlier stages of acute local"
inflammation. It is used topically to relieve pain.
"GENERAL ACTIONS.--Locally applied, in virtue of its action on sensory"
"nerves, aconite produces first irritation, tingling and twitching and"
subsequently numbness and anesthesia. The tincture of aconite is
"rapidly absorbed and quickly passed into the tissues, as is shown by"
the blood of a poisoned dog five minutes after the drug has been
"administered, being transferred into the veins of another dog without"
producing the physiological action of the poison.
TOXIC EFFECTS.--One and one-half drachm of the tincture (equal to about
one drachm of aconite root) is given as the minimum fatal dose for the
"horse, one-half drachm will occasionally cause very serious symptoms and"
where an idiosyncrasy exists as little as fifteen minims will cause
toxic symptoms.
"It causes great muscular weakness, dimness of sight; pupil at first may"
Clyde--hours wherein she had come to know him more intimately and to
feel that he was growing to a truer understanding of herself. She
realized beyond all doubt that for him there was but one woman in all
"the world, yet the mere pleasure of being near him was an anodyne for"
"her secret distress. Womanlike, she took what was offered her and"
strove unceasingly for more.
"Two days after sighting _The Juliet_ they raised another ship, one of"
"the sailing fleet which they knew to be hovering in the offing, and"
then on the fifth of the month the capricious current opened a way for
them. Slowly at first they pushed on between the floes into a vast area
"of slush-ice, thence to a stretch as open and placid as a country"
"mill-pond. The lookout pointed a path out of this, into which they"
"steamed, coming at length to clear water, with the low shores of the"
mainland twenty miles away.
"At sundown they anchored in the wide estuary of the Kalvik River, the"
noisy rumble of their chains breaking the silence that for months had
lain like a smother upon the port. The Indian village gave sign of life
"only in thin, azure wisps of smoke that rose from the dirt roofs; the"
cannery buildings stood as naked and uninviting as when Boyd had last
seen them. The Greek cross crowning the little white church was gilded
by the evening sun. Through the glasses Cherry spied a figure in the
"door of her house which she declared was Constantine, but with"
commendable caution the big breed forebore to join the fleet of kyaks
"now rapidly mustering. Taking Clyde with them, she and Boyd were soon"
"on their way to the land, leaving George to begin discharging his"
cargo. The long voyage that had maddened the fishermen was at last at
"an end, and they were eager to begin their tasks."
"A three-mile pull brought the ship's boat to Cherry's landing, where"
"Constantine and Chakawana met them, the latter hysterical with joy, the"
and helpful experiment.
To take a concrete example: let us suppose the story of Andersen's Tin
"Soldier told to a child of five or six years. At the first recital, the"
point which will interest the child most will be the setting up of the
"tin soldiers on the table, because he can understand this by means of"
"his own experience, in his own nursery: it is an appeal to conditions"
to which he is accustomed and for which no exercise of the imagination
"is needed, unless we take the effect of memory to be, according to"
"Queyrat, retrospective imagination."
"The next incident that appeals is the unfamiliar behaviour of the toys,"
"but still in familiar surroundings; that is to say, the _unusual_"
activities are carried on in the safe precincts of the nursery--in the
_usual_ atmosphere of the child.
I quote from the text:
"“Late in the evening the other soldiers were put in their box, and the"
people of the house went to bed. Now was the time for the toys to play;
"they amused themselves with paying visits, fighting battles and giving"
"balls. The tin soldiers rustled about in their box, for they wanted to"
"join the games, but they could not get the lid off. The nut-crackers"
"turned somersaults, and the pencil scribbled nonsense on the slate.”"
"Now, from this point onwards in the story, the events will be quite"
"outside the personal experience of the child, and there will have"
to be a real stretch of imagination to appreciate the thrilling and
"blood-curdling adventures of the little tin soldier, namely, the"
"terrible sailing down the gutter under the bridge, the meeting with"
"the fierce rat who demands the soldier's passport, the horrible"
"sensation in the fish's body, etc. Last of all, perhaps, will come"
fewer than twelve Mrs. Teach still alive at different ports up and down
the West India Islands.
"In June, 1718, the bridegroom felt that the call of duty must be obeyed,"
"so kissing good-bye to the new Mrs. Teach, he sailed away to the Bermudas,"
"meeting on his way half a dozen ships, which he plundered, and then"
hurried back to share the spoils with the Governor of North Carolina and
"his secretary, Mr. Knight."
"For several months, Blackbeard remained in the river, exacting a toll from"
"all the shipping, often going ashore to make merry at the expense of the"
"planters. At length, things became so unbearable that the citizens and"
planters sent a request to the Governor of the neighbouring colony of
"Virginia for help to rid them of the presence of Teach. The Governor,"
"Spotswood, an energetic man, at once made plans for taking the pirate, and"
"commissioned a gallant young naval officer, Lieutenant Robert Maynard, of"
"H.M.S. _Pearl_, to go in a sloop, the _Ranger_, in search of him. On"
"November 17, 1718, the lieutenant sailed for Kicquetan in the James River,"
"and on the 21st arrived at the mouth of Okerecock Inlet, where he"
discovered the pirate he was in search of. Blackbeard would have been
"caught unprepared had not his friend, Mr. Secretary Knight, hearing what"
"was on foot, sent a letter warning him to be on his guard, and also any of"
Teach's crew whom he could find in the taverns of Bath Town. Maynard lost
"no time in attacking the pirate's ship, which had run aground. The fight"
"was furious, Teach boarding the sloop and a terrific hand-to-hand struggle"
"taking place, the lieutenant and Teach fighting with swords and pistols."
"Teach was wounded in twenty-five places before he fell dead, while the"
lieutenant escaped with nothing worse than a cut over the fingers.
"Maynard now returned in triumph in his sloop to Bath Town, with the head"
"of Blackbeard hung up to the bolt-spit end, and received a tremendous"
ovation from the inhabitants.
"""What will your prisoners get by way of punishment?"""
"""I am not sure, but I can guess pretty closely. The principal will go"
out suddenly early some morning. He is a Jew of uncertain Central
"European origin, Pole or Czech, a natural born British subject, a"
"shining light of a local anti-German society, an 'indispensable' in"
his job and exempted from military service. He will give no more
"trouble. Menteith will spend anything from seven to ten years in p.s.,"
"learn to do without his daily whisky bottle, and possibly come out a"
"decent citizen. The draughtsman, I expect, will be let off with"
"eighteen months of the Jug. We are just, but not harsh. My birds don't"
interest me much once they have been caught; it is the catching that I
"enjoy. Down in the south, where I have a home of my own--which I"
haven't seen during the past year except occasionally for an hour or
two--I used to grow big show chrysanthemums. All through the processes
"of rooting the cuttings, repotting, taking the buds, feeding up the"
"plants, I never could endure any one to touch them. But once the"
"flowers were fully developed, my wife could cut them as much as she"
pleased and fill the house with them. My job was done when I had got
the flowers perfect. It is just the same with my business. I cultivate
"the little dears I am after, and hate any one to interfere with me; I"
humour them and water them and feed them with opportunities till they
"are ripe, and then I stick out my hand and grab them. After that the"
"law can do what it likes with them; they ain't my concern any more."""
By this time it had become apparent even to my slow intelligence why
Dawson told me so much about himself and his methods. He had formed
"the central figure in a real story in print, and the glory of it"
"possessed him. He had tasted of the rich sweet wine of fame, and he"
thirsted for more of the same vintage. He never in so many words asked
"me to write this book, but his eagerness to play Dr. Johnson to my"
Boswell appeared in all our relations. He was communicative far beyond
witness the exhibition.  It was a fine stretch of ground which had been
"chosen—nearly a mile in length, and with several natural obstacles,"
"which had been increased in some cases artificially, to test better the"
strength and skill of horse and rider.  A stream of water with rather
"awkward banks ran across the course in one place, and in another was a"
dip in the ground filled with gorse bushes—a nasty place to get
"entangled in, if the horse could not be persuaded to clear the whole"
thing with a flying leap.  A broken stone wall with a ditch in front was
"another obstacle; and the last was a barrier entirely artificial, made"
"of hurdles and bushes high enough to tax the mettle of any horse, though"
"not absolutely insurmountable. Still it was a formidable object enough,"
"and Grey looked at it critically, walking Don Carlos up and down, to let"
the creature take his own observations with regard to the leap he was to
make.
"""It was here they were busy yesterday, but I could not see all they did."
I was afraid to leave Don Carlos with so many strangers about.  Some of
the grooms with the other horses looked up to mischief. But I heard them
say afterwards that Lord Sandford had not been satisfied with the field
as it was.  He said they must have something that really would be a
"test, or the black stallion and Don Carlos were like to come in"
"together."""
"But now a horn blew gaily, and horsemen were seen approaching from many"
quarters.  In the neighbourhood of the inn all was bustle and
"excitement, whilst from all sides there appeared streams of people"
converging to this spot.  Some fine carriages had been driven out from
"London, with bedecked ladies eager to witness the contest.  Others had"
stayed the night in the neighbourhood to be ready; and all the natives
"of the place who could get a holiday had come to gape at the fine folks,"
and see the grand gentlemen racing their own horses.
In physiognomy the San Blas Indians are heavy of feature and stocky of
"frame. Their color is dark olive, with no trace of the negro apparent,"
for it has been their unceasing study for centuries to retain their
"racial purity. Their features are regular and pleasing and, among the"
"children particularly, a high order of beauty is often found. To get a"
"glimpse of their women is almost impossible, and a photograph of one is"
"practically unknown. If overtaken on the water, to which they often"
"resort in their cayucas, the women will wrap their clothing about their"
"faces, rather heedless of what other portions of their bodies may be"
"exposed, and make all speed for the shore. These women paint their faces"
"in glaring colors, wear nose rings, and always blacken their teeth on"
being married. Among them more pains is taken with clothing than among
"most of the savage Indians, many of their garments being made of a sort"
"of appliqué work in gaudy colors, with figures, often in representation"
"of the human form, cut out and inset in the garment."
So determined are the men of this tribe to maintain its blood
"untarnished by any admixture whatsoever, that they long made it an"
invariable rule to expel every white man from their territory at
nightfall. Of late years there has been a very slight relaxation of this
severity. Dr. Henri Pittier of the United States Department of
"Agriculture, one of the best-equipped scientific explorers in the"
"tropics, several of whose photographs elucidate this volume, has lived"
much among the San Blas and the Cuna-Cuna Indians and won their
friendship.
[Illustration: SOME SAN BLAS GIRLS

It was the ancestors of these Indians who made welcome Patterson and his
"of St. Peter's, a bone of Judas Iscariot (black, not white), and also"
"bones of all the other disciples (presumably of the normal color), a"
"handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of his face,"
"part of the crown of thorns, a fragment of the purple robe worn by"
"Christ, a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by St. Luke, and a"
nail from the cross--adding in another place that he thought he had
seen in all not less than a keg of these nails.
"But I had hardly taken Mark Twain seriously in these statements, not"
"knowing at the time that his _Innocents Abroad_ was, notwithstanding"
"its broad humor, really one of the best guide-books to Europe that was"
ever written.
[Sidenote: The Palladium of Venice.]
I had read repeatedly the story of the bringing of St. Mark's bones
"from Alexandria, in Egypt, to their present resting-place in St. Mark's"
Cathedral at Venice--a story which is related as follows in that same
lively volume:
"""St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think."
"However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of"
the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for
"Venice is much younger than any other Italian city), a priest dreamed"
that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought
"to Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the"
"nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and"
a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians
"allowed the Saint to be removed from his new resting-place, in that"
day Venice would perish from off the face of the earth. The priest
"proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the"
"corpse of St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but"
went to one of these islands where many deer were to be found and set
"fire to the grass to drive them out of cover, shooting them as they came"
"out. Some deer, fleeing before the fire, swam across and escaped, others"
"fell victims, but one fawn, barely half grown, ran right down the"
"island, and in its blind terror it leaped into a boat at anchor there."
This boat was that of a fisherman who was plying his trade at some
"distance, and the only occupant of the boat was his wife. Now this woman"
"had a year or so before lost her son, very much loved by her, but who"
"was not quite of the best character, and when she saw the deer leaping"
"into the boat, she at once fancied that she saw the soul of her erring"
son looking at her out of its great terrified eyes. So she got up and
"took the poor panting beast in her arms and soothed it, and when the"
"hunters came running to her to claim it she refused. 'He is my son,' she"
"said, 'he is mine. Shall I give him up to death?' The hunters clamoured"
"and threatened to take the deer by force, but the woman was quite firm."
"She would never give him up except with her life. 'You can see,' she"
"said, 'that it is true that he is my son. He came running straight to"
"me, as he always did in his trouble when he was a boy, and he is now"
"quite quiet and contented, instead of being afraid of me as an ordinary"
"deer would be.' And it was quite true that the deer took to her at once,"
and remained with her willingly. So the hunters went off to the court of
the governor and filed a suit for the deer.
"The case was tried in open court, and the deer was produced with a"
ribbon round its neck. Evidence there was naturally but little. The
hunters claimed the deer because they had driven it out of the island by
their fire. The woman resisted the claim on the ground that it was her
son.
The decision of the court was this:
'The hunters are not entitled to the deer because they cannot prove that
The Girl chided him with gentle authority.
"""You keep perfectly still--you mustn't say nothin' 'til you've rested."
"Everythin's all right an' you needn't worry a bit."" But then seeing that"
"he chafed at this, she added: ""Well, then, I'll tell you all there is to"
"know."" And then followed an account of the happenings of that night. It"
"was not a thoroughly truthful tale, for in her narrative she told him"
"only what she thought was necessary and good for him to know, keeping"
the rest to herself. And when she had related all that there was to tell
"she insisted upon his going to sleep again, giving him no opportunity"
"whatsoever to speak, since she left his bedside after drawing the"
curtains.
Unwillingly the man lay back and tried to force himself to be patient;
"but he fretted at the enforced quietude and, as a result, sleep refused"
to come to him. From time to time he could hear the Girl moving
noiselessly about the room. The knowledge that she was there gave him a
"sense of security, and he began to let his thoughts dwell upon her. No"
longer did he doubt but what she was a real influence now; and the
thought had the effect of making him keenly alive to what his life had
"been. It was not a pleasant picture that he looked back upon, now that"
he had caught a glimpse of what life might mean with the Girl at his
side. From the moment that he had taken her in his arms he realised to
"the full that his cherished dream had come true; he realised, also, that"
there was now but one answer to the question of keeping to the oath
"given to his father, and that was that gratitude--for he had guessed"
"rightly, though she had not told him, that she had saved him from"
capture by the Sheriff and his posse--demanded that he should put an end
to his vocation and devote his life henceforth to making her happy.
Once or twice while thus communing with himself he fancied that he heard
which will certainly remain as the most lasting monument raised to the
memory of the poet on this occasion. This troubled peace cannot make
him deviate from the path of his appointed labour any more than the war
"could; in peace as in war, his duty is his daily task, here and to-day,"
and his confidence in the morality and usefulness of that work which is
"his work is as little shaken by the prophets of despair in peace, as"
it was by the messiahs of the promised land who were so loud above the
turmoil of war. He is probably now noting with a smile that the same
"men who talked of the war to end all wars, are now very busy preventing"
"our civilization from dying away; that is, building a peace in the"
"abstract, with programs and words, as they fought a war which was not"
"the war, but a phantasm of their imagination."

II. THE THEORY OF HISTORY
Two meanings of the word history--History as contemporary history--
"History and chronicle--The spirit as history--Philology, and"
philological history--Poetical and rhetorical history--Universal
history--The universality of history: history and philosophy--The
unity of thought--Philosophy as methodology--The positivity of
history--The humanity of history--Distinctions and divisions--The
history of nature.
"There are two meanings to the word history, in English as well as in"
[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 2.--Secondary Hæmorrhages in a case of
Hæmothorax. Case No. 151]
"(151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from"
"100 to 200 yards. _Entry_, 1 inch from the left axillary margin"
"in the first intercostal space; _exit_, at the back of the"
right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleuræ were
"therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,"
"then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into"
"the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs"
"of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right"
"side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The"
temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the
"right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the"
emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve
"symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,"
and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood
"was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last"
pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the
"third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition"
"also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,"
"reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an"
"inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was"
eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The
"amount of hæmoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case"
"was possibly one of pulmonary hæmothorax, as after death no"
source of hæmorrhage could be localised in the intercostal
"space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a"
part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an
"inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the"
"organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original"
"distance--hair up and teeth bared. The feeling is spontaneous,"
"unpredictable, and the usual result is fight."
"Up to this time she had not seen me, or even known of my insignificant"
"existence; but suddenly, as though it were a sally of banter whose blade"
"he parried in the nick of time, her laughter-bathed eyes darted past him"
and squarely met my own; her lips sobered into a half parted expression
"of interest and, some strange thought--perhaps unbidden--coming into her"
"mind, sent the blood surging to her cheeks. As quickly as this happened"
"it had gone, and again she seemed to be absorbing the attention of her"
_vis-à-vis_.
"Once, years ago in the Dolomites, I thoughtlessly struck my staff upon a"
"piece of rock when, lo, a wonderful tone arose therefrom. And the memory"
"of that rich, unbidden sound was re-awakened now as the contact of our"
glances stirred something which thrilled me with a maddening sense of
harmony. As an E string vibrates when another E is struck somewhere near
"to it, so my being vibrated with each tilt of her head, each movement of"
her lips. Yet however much I conjured the magnet of my will to make her
"look again, she successfully, if coquettishly, resisted."
The Spanish waiter came up softly to refill my glass; an attention I
"permitted, murmuring happily:"
"""Right, kiddo! Stay me with flagons, comfort me with champagne, for my"
"heart is faint with love!""--only Solomon didn't sing it quite like"
"that, the fickle old dog, nor did my waiter understand me, which was"
just as well.
Engrossed with watching her I saw a new look come into her face as she
quickly whispered something across the table. Her _vis-à-vis_ turned
"impatiently as a man approached them, who to my surprise was the yacht"
"breakfast, and were ready for the day’s work. As a matter of fact, they"
"took less time than usual, for something of Bainbridge’s intense"
eagerness for speed seemed to have made itself felt.
All morning Bob worked like a Trojan getting the drive out into the
"Katahdin River. He did not storm and swear at his men, as many bosses"
do. Instead he had a way of jollying them along in a manner which might
"sound superficially like fun, but which held more than an undercurrent"
"of seriousness. He treated them as human beings, not as if they were"
"slaves from whom every last atom of work was to be extracted. And yet,"
"when the need arose, he could hand out a rebuke, the caustic sting of"
which was enough to make a man’s hair stand on end. The result was that
"the crew soon admired him, and when they found how urgent was the need"
"for haste they fell to with a will, and gave the best that was in them."
"Bainbridge was not long in perceiving their attitude, and it gratified"
him intensely. He had never actually had charge of a drive before. He
"knew the theory, of course, but that is very different from the"
practical operation; and the discovery that he could handle a
rough-and-ready crowd like this in a manner so totally different from
that generally practiced by bosses of crews gave him no small
satisfaction.
"By dint of constant labor, at which Bob spared neither himself nor his"
"men, the drive was successfully swung into the slightly larger river by"
two o’clock. There was no real respite even then. The stream was almost
"as difficult as the Megantic, and constant watchfulness was necessary to"
prevent fresh jams at a number of points. Consequently the men snatched
a hurried dinner in relays and hustled back to work again.
"It was about three, and Bob had just left the spot where only the most"
strenuous personal labor on the part of himself and four river jacks had
"Helena returned from Palestine, bringing with her the stone on which"
"Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin Mary"
"sat down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the temple,"
"the horses drawing these precious relics stood still at this spot,"
"and refused every effort to make them move. Then Christian people,"
"'recognizing the finger of God,' erected a church on this spot--_S."
"Giacomo Scossa Cavalli_--where the stones are still to be seen."""
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Knees.]
"While speaking of interesting stones, I must not omit to mention those"
"in the Church of S. Francesca Romana, near the Forum, containing the"
"marks of the knees of St. Peter--(which show, by the way, that this"
apostle was a giant in size)--when he knelt to pray that Simon Magus
might be dropped by the demons he had invoked to support him in the
air in fulfilment of his promise to fly. One of these stones used to
"lie in the _Via Sacra_, and the water which collected in the two holes"
or knee prints was looked upon as so potent a remedy of disease that
groups of infirm people used to gather around them on the approach of
"a shower. According to the legend, the place where Peter knelt when"
he thus effected the discomfiture of Simon Magus and brought him to
"the ground with such force that his thigh was fractured, never to be"
"healed, was the ancient _Via Sacra_. But, after the priests had removed"
"the stone from the roadway into the church, the inconsiderate and"
"iconoclastic explorers of our day, who have made so many discoveries in"
"their excavations about the Forum, proved that the roadway from which"
"this relic was taken was not the ancient _Via Sacra_ at all, but a more"
modern roadway which had been mistaken for it!
[Sidenote: The Hardness of St. Peter's Head.]
"In the Mamertine Prisons, which are also quite close to the Forum, a"
"could not make a Burman ill-use his pony if you tried, and I fancy that"
to break these little half-wild ponies to go in cabs in crowded streets
"requires severe treatment. At least, I never knew but one"
"hackney-carriage driver either in Rangoon or Mandalay who was a Burman,"
and he very soon gave it up. He said that the work was too heavy either
"for a pony or a man. I think, perhaps, it was for the safety of the"
"public that he resigned, for his ponies were the very reverse of"
meek--which a native of India says a hackney-carriage pony should
be--and he drove entirely by the light of Nature.
"So all the drivers of gharries, as we call them, are natives of India or"
"half-breeds, and it is amongst them that the work of the Society for the"
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals principally lies. While I was in
"Rangoon I tried a number of cases of over-driving, of using ponies with"
"sore withers and the like. I never tried a Burman. Even in Rangoon,"
"which has become almost Indianized, his natural humanity never left the"
"Burman. As far as Burmans are concerned, the Society for the Prevention"
of Cruelty to Animals need not exist. They are kinder to their animals
than even the members of the Society could be. Instances occur every
day; here is one of the most striking that I remember.
"There is a town in Burma where there are some troops stationed, and"
which is the headquarters of the civil administration of the district.
"It is, or was then, some distance from a railway-station, and it was"
necessary to make some arrangement for the carriage of the mails to and
"from the town and station. The Post-Office called for tenders, and at"
length it was arranged through the civil authorities that a coach should
run once a day each way to carry the mails and passengers. A native of
India agreed to take the contract--for Burmans seldom or never care to
take them--and he was to comply with certain conditions and receive a
certain subsidy.
"and throwing down great loops of rope. Under the trees, growing along"
"the ground, were smaller creepers full of thorns, that tore the wayfarer"
"and barred his progress. The forest, too, was full of snakes that crept"
"along the ground, so like in their gray and yellow skins to the earth"
they travelled on that the traveller trod upon them unawares and was
bitten; and some so beautiful with coral red and golden bars that men
would pick them up as some dainty jewel till the snake turned upon them.
Here and there in this forest were little glades wherein there were
"flowers. Beautiful flowers they were, with deep white cups and broad"
glossy leaves hiding the purple fruit; and some had scarlet blossoms
"that nodded to and fro like drowsy men, and there were long festoons of"
white stars. The air there was heavy with their scent. But they were all
"full of thorns, only you could not see the thorns till after you had"
plucked the blossom.
"This wood was pierced by roads. Many were very broad, leading through"
"the forest in divers ways, some of them stopping now and then in the"
"glades, others avoiding them more or less, but none of them were"
"straight. Always, if you followed them, they bent and bent until after"
"much travelling you were where you began; and the broader the road, the"
"softer the turf beneath it; the sweeter the glades that lined it, the"
quicker did it turn.
"One road there was that went straight, but it was far from the others."
It led among the rocks and cliffs that bounded one side of the valley.
"It was very rough, very far from all the glades in the lowlands. No"
"flowers grew beside it, there was no moss or grass upon it, only hard"
"sharp rocks. It was very narrow, bordered with precipices."
"There were many lights in this wood, lights that flamed out like sunsets"
"and died, lights that came like lightning in the night and were gone."
"There is still much land available for cocoanut planting, though but"
"little of it is government land. Both coasts are fit for this industry,"
"unlike the banana industry, which thrives only on the Atlantic shore."
"Panama is outside of the hurricane belt, which gives an added advantage"
to the cocoanut planter. Elsewhere in the Caribbean the trees suffer
severely from the high winds.
The lumber of Panama will in time come to be one of its richest assets.
In the dense forests hardwoods of a dozen varieties or more are to be
"found, but as yet the cost of getting it out is prohibitive in most"
sections. Only those forests adjacent to streams are economically
"valuable and such activity as is shown is mainly along the Bayano,"
"Chucunaque, and Tuyra Rivers. The list of woods is almost interminable."
The prospectus of one of the companies with an extended territory on the
"Bayano River notes eighteen varieties of timber, commercially valuable"
on its territory. Among those the names of which are unfamiliar are the
"espavé (sometimes spelled espevé), the cocobolo, the espinosa cedar, the"
zoro and the sangre. All are hard woods serviceable in cabinet making.
The espavé is as hard as mahogany and of similar color and marking. The
trees will run four to five feet thick at the stump with saw timber 60
"to 70 feet in length. Espinosa trees are of the cedar type, growing to"
"enormous size, frequently exceeding 16 feet in circumference. The"
"cocobolo is a hard wood, but without the beauty to fit it for cabinet"
work. The sangre derives its name from its red sap which exudes from a
"gash like blood. It takes a high polish, and is in its general"
characteristics not unlike our cherry.
For the casual tourist the lumber district most easy of access is that
along the Bayano River reached by a motor boat or steam launch in a few
"hours from Panama. The trip is frequently made by pleasure seekers, for"
perhaps nowhere in the world is the beauty of a phosphorescent sea at
"night so marvelously shown, and few places easily found by man show such"
"you cleaned out the stable?"" he asked. ""Yes, indeed, master, it is"
"spick and span,"" said the king's son. ""I'll have to see that,"" said the"
"giant, and went into the stable; but it was just as the king's son had"
"said. ""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could"
"not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Master Girl? What is a"
"Master Girl?"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ""I'd"
"like to see her, too."" ""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the"
giant.
The next morning the giant went off again with his goats. And he told
"the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he"
"had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said"
"he. ""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering"
"yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his"
"herd. ""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in"
"spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl,"
"for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her."
"She asked him what work he had to do that day. ""O, it is not so bad"
"to-day,"" said the king's son. ""I am only to fetch his horse from the"
"pasture."" ""And how are you going to manage that?"" asked the Master Girl."
"""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the"
"king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ""Yet it is not an"
"easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will"
"tell you how to set about it: When you see the horse, he will come"
"running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning"
"pine-torch. Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door,"
"and throw it into his mouth, for then he will grow so tame that you can"
"do what you will with him."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long,"
"and they chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how"
"delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if"
they could only marry and get away from the giant. And the king's son
This table shows in its second column the prices paid by the
"Sinaketans to the industrial villages of Kuboma, a district in the"
Northern Trobriands. In the third column what they receive in Dobu
"is recorded. The table has been obtained from a Sinaketan informant,"
"and it probably is far from accurate, and the transactions are sure"
"to vary greatly in the gain which they afford. There is no doubt,"
"however, that for each article, the Sinaketan would ask the price"
which he paid for them as well as some extra article.
Thus we see that there is in this transaction a definite gain obtained
by the middlemen. The natives of Sinaketa act as intermediaries
"between the industrial centres of the Trobriands and Dobu, whereas"
their hosts play the same rôle between the Sinaketans and the men
from the outlying districts.
"Besides trading and obtaining of Kula valuables, the natives of"
"Sinaketa visit their friends and their distant relatives, who, as we"
"saw before, are to be found in this district owing to migrations. The"
"visitors walk across the flat, fertile plain from one hamlet to the"
"other, enjoying some of the marvellous and unknown sights of this"
"district. They are shown the hot springs of Numanuma and of Deyde'i,"
"which are in constant eruption. Every few minutes, the water boils up"
"in one spring after another of each group, throwing up jets of spray"
"a few metres high. The plain around these springs is barren, with"
nothing but here and there a stunted kind of eucalyptus tree. This
is the only place in the whole of Eastern New Guinea where as far
"as I know, eucalyptus trees are to be found. This was at least the"
"information of some intelligent natives, in whose company I visited"
"the springs, and who had travelled all over the Eastern islands and"
the East end of the mainland.
"The land-locked bays and lagoons, the Northern end of Dawson Strait,"
"au moyen âge_, Bruxelles, 1874, p. 146 _sq._). There is some"
obscurity as to when the foreign Hansards were first permitted to
have warehouses and residences of their own in London. Cp.
"Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. i, §"
"68; and Ashley, i, 105, following Schanz, who dates this privilege"
"in the reign of Henry III, though the merchants of Cologne (_id._"
p. 110) had a _hansa_ or gildhall in London in the reign of Richard
"I. Under whatever conditions, it is clear that London was one of"
the first foreign cities in which the German Hansard traders came
in friendly contact.
A reciprocal and normal egoism furthered as well as thwarted the Hansard
enterprise. Trade in the feudal period being a ground of privilege like
"any other, the monopolied merchants of every city strove to force"
"foreign traders to deal with them only. On the other hand, the English"
nobility sought to deal rather with the foreigner directly than with the
"English middlemen; and thus in each feudal country, but notably in"
"England,[717] the interest of the landed class tended to throw foreign"
"trade substantially in foreign hands, which did their best to hold it."
In the reigns of the Edwards privileges of free trade with natives were
gradually conferred on the foreign traders[718] in the interests of the
"landed class--the only ""general consumers"" who could then make their"
claims felt--in despite of the angry resistance of the native merchant
"class. For the rest, in a period when some maritime English cities, like"
"those of France and Germany, could still carry on private wars with each"
"other as well as with foreign cities,[719] a trader of one English town"
"was in any other English town on all fours with a foreigner.[720] When,"
"therefore, the foreigners combined, their advantage over the native"
trade was twofold.
Naturally the cities least liable to regal interference carried on a
"cosmopolitan co-operation to the best advantage. The Hansa of London,"
"before undertaking it, and to calculate the probable benefit it could"
"get therefrom, and the probable expenses it would incur; not to speak of"
the result of any possible failure. It may be presumed that Japan would
not tamely be intimidated by any action undertaken by any country which
"is not based on justice and equity, and which, therefore, is not open to"
reason.
"Further, is there any country which would willingly embark on such an"
enterprise single-handed? I think not. The reason is too obvious for me
to elucidate.
"Putting aside altogether any question of justice and equity, if such an"
"enterprise is to be embarked upon at all, it would have to be by common"
"action of all the Western Powers, somewhat similar to that when the"
combined forces of Europe rose against France some hundred years ago.
But let me ask if such a thing is possible under the present
circumstances? The claims of Japan to the kind consideration of humanity
have already become so widely spread that she could no longer be
"trampled upon easily. Man is, after all, a rational being. Do the"
writers of the articles on the Yellow Peril (articles which even now
repeatedly make their appearance) not know the fact that even in France
there is a large number of people who have recently purchased Japanese
"bonds, not to speak of Germany, where those bonds have been openly"
floated by banks of high standing? Even if all the governments of the
"West should be willing to agree to such an enterprise, I do not think"
the people at large would move with them.
"Japan is modest enough, Japan is honest enough. Why does she deserve a"
"general ostracism? She might become, it is possible, a Power of the"
"world. She might become, it is possible, more civilised on the lines of"
"occidental civilisation, after which she strives so earnestly. Are these"
"Redditch seemed to dance up and down me, but I stuck it out--and I had"
"my reward, I had my reward. I did my duty, but it's a sick and sorry"
"man that I am this day."""
"""There was nothing else to be done,"" I said. ""What you feel now is a"
"nervous reaction."""
"""That's about it. I watched and watched, never feeling a bit like"
sleep though my eyes burned something cruel and my feet--they were
"lumps of prickly wood, not feet. Dull lumps with every now and then a"
stab as if a tin tack had been driven into them. Beyond me in the open
"alley-way the light was strong, and I could see men pass frequently,"
"but no one came into my corner till the end, and no one saw me. I"
"heard six bells go in the first watch ('Eleven p.m.,' whispered Cary)"
"on Friday evening, though there was a good bit of noise of getting"
"ready to go out in the early morning, and I was beginning to think"
"that all my trouble might go for naught, when a man in a Navy cap and"
overalls stopped just opposite my dark hole between two bulkheads. His
"face was turned from me, as he looked carefully up and down the"
"lighted way. He stood there quite still for some seconds, and then"
stepped backwards towards me. I could see him plain against the light
"beyond. He listened for another minute or so, and, satisfied that no"
"one was near, spun on his heels, whipped a tool from his dungaree"
"overalls, and reached up to the wires which ran under the deck beams"
overhead. In spite of my aching joints and sore feet I was out in a
flash and had my bayonet up against his chest. He didn't move till my
point was through his clothes and into his flesh. I just shoved till
"he gave ground, and so, step by step, I pushed him with the point of"
"my bayonet till he was under the lights. His arms had come down, he"
dropped the big shears with insulated handles which he had drawn from
"his pocket, but he didn't speak a word to me and I did not speak to"
"him. I just held him there under the lights, and we looked at one"

containing dark blood.
On the commencement of the third day the patient's expression
"was extremely anxious, and he was suffering great pain. Pulse"
"96, temperature 100°. Tongue moist, occasional vomiting, bowels"
open yesterday. Has taken fluid nourishment since injury. The
"abdomen moved with respiration, but was moderately distended,"
especially in the line of the transverse colon; it was
"tympanitic on percussion, there was no dulness in the flanks,"
and only moderate rigidity of the wall on palpation. Frothy
fluid stained with bile and fæcal in odour was escaping from
"the wound of exit, and the everted margins of the latter were"
bile-stained.
A vertical incision was carried downwards from the wound for 4
inches. A rugged furrow was found on the under surface of the
left lobe of the liver; the stomach was contracted and firmly
adherent by recent lymph to the under surface of the liver and
the diaphragm. The transverse colon was much distended. On
separating the stomach a slit wound was found at the lesser
"curvature, immediately to the right of the oesophagus. This"
wound was closed with some difficulty with two tiers of
"sutures; the cavity was mopped out, and then irrigated with"
boiled water; a plug was introduced along the line of the
"furrow in the liver, and the lower part of the abdominal"
incision closed.
"The patient stood the operation well, and was removed to his"
"tent; during the day, however, two thunder showers occurred"
"during each of which water, several inches if not a foot deep,"
rushed through the camp. After the second flood he was removed
"to the operating room, the only house we had, and slept there."
"examined it, but there was no writing upon it.  Apparently it was her"
"reserve store of paper, to be used as wanted.  In the French Ministry of"
"Foreign Affairs everything is methodical, especially the preparation of"
"the dossiers.  A certain dossier had once fallen into Kaye's hands, and"
it contained sheets of exactly similar paper to that which I held in my
hand.
"Eagerly I continued my search, striving to discover some writing which"
"might lead me to a knowledge of the truth, but I found nothing.  I had"
"completed an examination of the whole of the contents of the drawers,"
when it occurred to me that there might be some other drawer concealed
there.  Years ago I had been offered an escritoire of this pattern in
"Genoa, and the sun-tanned fellow who endeavoured to induce me to"
purchase it had shown behind the centre drawer in the table a cunningly
contrived cavity where private correspondence might be concealed.
"Therefore I drew out the drawer, sounded the interior at the back, and,"
"finding it hollow, searched about for the spring by which it might be"
"opened.  At last I found it, and next moment drew forth a bundle of"
letters.  They were bound with a blue ribbon that time had faded.  I
"glanced at the superscription of the uppermost, and a thrill of sympathy"
went through me.
Those carefully preserved letters were my own--letters full of love and
"tenderness, which I had written in the days that were dead.  I stood"
"holding them in my hand, my heart full of the past."
"In this narrative, my reader, it is my intention to conceal nothing, but"
"to relate to you the whole, undisguised truth, even though this chapter"
of England's secret history presents a seemingly improbable combination
of strange facts and circumstances.  Therefore I will not hide from you
"the truth that in those moments, as I drew forth one of the letters I"
"a certain district in the South-East, abutting on to the frontiers"
"of Afghanistan and of Baluchistan, and known as the Sarhad, which is"
occupied by a number of nomad tribes who claim absolute independence.
At this time these tribes were causing considerable embarrassment and
difficulty to the Indian Government.
"The Germans and their agents, who were past masters in the art of"
"propaganda, were still endeavouring, as they had done for years"
"before the outbreak of hostilities, to work upon the discontented"
portion of the Indian population in the hope of rousing them into
"open rebellion. They believed this to be quite possible, in spite of"
the magnificent way in which India had offered her resources of men
"and money to the British Raj, and hoped thereby to handicap us still"
further in our great struggle in the West.
"They were pouring their agents, with their lying propaganda, into"
"India via Persia and Afghanistan. Afghanistan, like Persia, was"
"nominally neutral, but she was breaking her neutrality by many open"
"acts of aggression, and was offering every facility in her power"
"to the German agents in their passage through her territories, and"
thence into the Punjab.
"To reach Afghanistan, however, the German agents had to pass through"
some part of Persia. The Persian Government placed no restrictions on
"the movements of either British or Germans, of which fact the latter"
took full advantage.
A glance at the map will show that apparently the easiest route for
"them to take across Persia was in the North, in the Russian sphere of"
"influence, and to approach Afghanistan through Korasan; or, failing"
"this, by a route rather farther South, across the Lut Desert, in the"
direction of Birjand. As a matter of fact they had tried both these
"that a fervent Buddhist will not kill even a fish, but a fisherman is"
not quite such a reprobate as a hunter in popular estimation. And the
"Nats think so too, for the Nat of a pool will not forbid all fishing."
"You must give him his share; you must be respectful to him, and not"
"offend him; and then he will fill your nets with gleaming fish, and all"
"will go well with you. If not, of course, you will come to grief; your"
"nets will be torn, and your boat upset; and finally, if obstinate, you"
"will be drowned. A great arm will seize you, and you will be pulled"
under and disappear for ever.
A Nat is much like a human being; if you treat him well he will treat
"you well, and conversely. Courtesy is never wasted on men or Nats, at"
"least, so a Burman tells me."
The highest Nats live in the mountains. The higher the Nat the higher
"the mountain; and when you get to a very high peak indeed, like"
"Mainthong Peak in Wuntho, you encounter very powerful Nats."
"They tell a story of Mainthong Peak and the Nats there, how all of a"
"sudden, one day in 1885, strange noises came from the hill. High up on"
his mighty side was heard the sound of great guns firing slowly and
"continuously; there was the thunder of falling rocks, cries as of"
"someone bewailing a terrible calamity, and voices calling from the"
precipices. The people living in their little hamlets about his feet
were terrified. Something they knew had happened of most dire import to
"them, some catastrophe which they were powerless to prevent, which they"
could not even guess. But when a few weeks later there came even into
"those remote villages the news of the fall of Mandalay, of the surrender"
"of the king, of the 'great treachery,' they knew that this was what the"
Nats had been sorrowing over. All the Nats everywhere seem to have been
"distressed at our arrival, to hate our presence, and to earnestly desire"
"our absence. They are the spirits of the country and of the people, and"
"café. I felt its tremendous emphasis, and was content."
"Then, quite without warning, I caught my breath as my glance fell upon a"
girl dining with an old chap but three tables away. Among the habitués
of the Ritzes of two continents there could not have been found another
"like her, for never had I beheld a face as exquisite--and I've seen"
many. It possessed a beauty that left me helpless--yet there was an
indefinable sadness in it that might have suggested a haunting fear.
"One of the lights among the vines hung close to her, and I could see"
"these things. Even could I see the color of her eyes, deep purple"
eyes--the tone the wild iris takes at twilight. When she leaned one way
I might have thought the rich abundance of her hair contained spun
"copper or deep red gold, and again I would have sworn it matched the"
"mellow brown of chestnuts; in all forming an arrangement of waves, each"
"refusing to stay in place yet never really getting out of order, each"
coquetting with a subtle mischief that found an echo in her lips. Her
neck and shoulders were of that perfection that men realize but can not
"analyze; and her mouth, laughing or in repose, was maddening."
And there was an added charm quite apart from hair and eyes and lips.
"This I had never before seen in any face. Animation? Yes, and more."
"Interest in the life about her? Assuredly, to a very marked degree."
"Wildness? That was it!--a wildness, subtly blended with refinement, that"
found expression in every quick look; as if someone had put a fawn there
"from the forest and it was trying, half humorously, half confidently, to"
keep itself from running away in fright. It was this glory of wildness
that she typified which made my cheeks grow hot with watching.
"But who has ever made a picture worthy of his dreams! How, then, can I"
"describe this girl, when painter, sculptor, writer--all--would miserably"
fail at attempting to portray a beauty whereon imagination might gaze in
moderate. Meanwhile the smouldering quarrel with Lee assumed ever more
hateful forms. In vain did Erasmus's English friends attempt to restrain
"their young, ambitious compatriot. Erasmus on his part irritated him"
furtively. He reveals in this whole dispute a lack of self-control and
dignity which shows his weakest side. Usually so anxious as to decorum
"he now lapses into invectives: The British adder, Satan, even the old"
taunt ascribing a tail to Englishmen has to serve once more. The points
at issue disappear altogether behind the bitter mutual reproaches. In
"his unrestrained anger, Erasmus avails himself of the most unworthy"
weapons. He eggs his German friends on to write against Lee and to
"ridicule him in all his folly and brag, and then he assures all his"
English friends: 'All Germany is literally furious with Lee; I have the
greatest trouble in keeping them back'.
Alack! Germany had other causes of disturbance: it is 1520 and the three
great polemics of Luther were setting the world on fire.
Though one may excuse the violence and the petty spitefulness of Erasmus
"in this matter, as resulting from an over-sensitive heart falling"
"somewhat short in really manly qualities, yet it is difficult to deny"
that he failed completely to understand both the arguments of his
adversaries and the great movements of his time.
It was very easy for Erasmus to mock the narrow-mindedness of
conservative divines who thought that there would be an end to faith in
Holy Scripture as soon as the emendation of the text was attempted.
"'""They correct the Holy Gospel, nay, the Pater Noster itself!"" the"
preacher exclaims indignantly in the sermon before his surprised
"congregation. As if I cavilled at Matthew and Luke, and not at those"
"who, out of ignorance and carelessness, have corrupted them. What do"
people wish? That the Church should possess Holy Scripture as correct as
"possible, or not?' This reasoning seemed to Erasmus, with his passionate"
"for the erudite, who are few; we shall bark to stir up the people. After"
1520 he writes again and again: 'I am stoned every day'.
"But Erasmus, however much he might see himself, not without reason, at"
"the centre, could, in 1519 and 1520, no longer be blind to the fact that"
the great struggle did not concern him alone. On all sides the battle
"was being fought. What is it, that great commotion about matters of"
spirit and of faith?
The answer which Erasmus gave himself was this: it is a great and wilful
conspiracy on the part of the conservatives to suffocate good learning
and make the old ignorance triumph. This idea recurs innumerable times
"in his letters after the middle of 1518. 'I know quite certainly', he"
"writes on 21 March 1519 to one of his German friends, 'that the"
barbarians on all sides have conspired to leave no stone unturned till
they have suppressed _bonae literae_.' 'Here we are still fighting with
the protectors of the old ignorance'; cannot Wolsey persuade the Pope to
stop it here? All that appertains to ancient and cultured literature is
called 'poetry' by those narrow-minded fellows. By that word they
"indicate everything that savours of a more elegant doctrine, that is to"
"say all that they have not learned themselves. All the tumult, the whole"
tragedy--under these terms he usually refers to the great theological
struggle--originates in the hatred of _bonae literae_. 'This is the
source and hot-bed of all this tragedy; incurable hatred of linguistic
"study and the _bonae literae_.' 'Luther provokes those enemies, whom it"
"is impossible to conquer, though their cause is a bad one. And meanwhile"
"envy harasses the _bonae literae_, which are attacked at his (Luther's)"
"instigation by these gadflies. They are already nearly insufferable,"
when things do not go well with them; but who can stand them when they
"triumph? Either I am blind, or they aim at something else than Luther."
They are preparing to conquer the phalanx of the Muses.'
of being borne upwards. Piéron has also noted this sensation at the moment
"of death from disease in a number of cases, usually accompanied by a sense"
"of well-being.[129] The cases he describes were mostly tuberculous, and"
"included individuals of both sexes, and of atheistic as well as religious"
"belief. In all, the last sensation to which expression was given was"
"one of flying, of moving upwards. In some death was peaceful, in others"
"painful. In one case a girl died clasping the iron bars of the bed, in"
"horror of being borne upwards. Piéron, no doubt rightly, associates this"
sensation with the similar sensation of rising and floating common in
"dreams, and with the feeling of moving upwards and resting on the air"
experienced by persons in the ecstatic state. In all these cases alike
"life is being concentrated in the brain and central organs, while the"
outlying districts of the body are becoming numb and dead.
In this way it comes about that out of dreams and of dream-like waking
"states, one of the most permanent of human spiritual conceptions has been"
"evolved. To float, to rise into the air, to fly up to heaven, has always"
seemed to man to be the final climax of spiritual activity. The angel is
the most ethereal creature the human imagination can conceive. Browning's
"cry to his 'lyric love, half angel and half bird,' pathetically crude as"
"poetry, is sound as psychology. The prophets and divine heroes of the race"
have constantly seemed to their devout followers to disappear at last by
"floating up into the sky, like Elijah, who went up 'by a whirlwind into"
"heaven.' St. Peter once thought he saw his Master walking on the waves,"
and the last vision of Jesus in the Gospels reveals him rising into
the air. For it is in the world of dreams that the human soul has its
"indestructible home, and in the attempt to realise these dreams lies a"
large part of our business in life.

Presently the seaplanes ceased firing and circled triumphantly over
"their vanquished foe. They knew that the Zeppelin was doomed, and"
instincts of humanity forbade them to take undue advantage of the
plight of her crew.
"""Away, boats!"" ordered the ""Sunderland's"" captain."
Instantly there was a rush to man the boats and to stand by the
"falls. With an alacrity that was part of his nature, Jack Tar"
"prepared to rescue his enemy, in spite of the fact that that enemy"
had sallied forth with the deliberate intention of hurling bombs with
"the utmost indiscrimination upon combatants and non-combatants alike,"
not excepting helpless women and children.
"Before the boats could be lowered a lurid blaze of light rolled out,"
rivalling the rays of the rising sun. Where the Zeppelin had been
"only a cloud of flame-tinged smoke remained, while from the"
mushroomed pall of vapour that marked a funereal pyre of yet another
"unit of the Kaiser's air-fleet, scorched and twisted girders and"
other débris streamed seawards.
Whether by accident or design the only remaining petrol tank had
"exploded, and the flames instantly igniting the huge volume of"
hydrogen had in the twinkling of an eye completed the work of
destruction.
For ten minutes the destroyers cruised over the spot where the
"débris had disappeared, but there were no signs of survivors, not"
even of wreckage. The remains of the Zeppelin had been swallowed up
"by the insatiable sea, and no visible trophy remained in the hands of"
the men who had baulked an attempted raid on the largest city of the

"touched his breast.  He was the Captain's first lodger, and it was said"
"of him that he had a great deal of money hidden somewhere, and for its"
sake had nearly had his throat cut some two years ago: ever since then
"he carried his head thus. Over his eyes hung greyish eyebrows, and,"
"looked at in profile, only his crooked nose was to be seen.  His shadow"
"reminded one of a poker.  He denied that he had money, and said that"
"they ""only tried to cut his throat out of malice,"" and from that day he"
"took to collecting rags, and that is why his head was always bent as if"
incessantly looking on the ground.  When he went about shaking his
"head, and minus a walking-stick in his hand, and a bag on his back--the"
"signs of his profession--he seemed to be thinking almost to madness,"
"and, at such times, Kuvalda spoke thus, pointing to him with his finger:"

"Tyapa, as a rule, spoke in a hoarse and hardly audible voice, and that"
"is why he spoke very little, and loved to be alone.  But whenever a"
"stranger, compelled to leave the village, appeared in the dosshouse,"
"Tyapa seemed sadder and angrier, and followed the unfortunate about"
with biting jeers and a wicked chuckling in his throat. He either put
"some beggar against him, or himself threatened to rob and beat him,"
till the frightened mujik would disappear from the dosshouse and never
"more be seen.  Then Tyapa was quiet again, and would sit in some corner"
"mending his rags, or else reading his Bible, which was as dirty, worn,"
and old as himself.  Only when the teacher brought a newspaper and
"began reading did he come from his corner once more.  As a rule, Tyapa"
"listened to what was read silently and sighed often, without asking"
"anything of anyone.  But once when the teacher, having read the paper,"

lined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and fibre. High into the
air extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse
"of fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle"
prow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch
"of her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and"
scored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an
attempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with
the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.
"A burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance,"
"nodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of"
passengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock
"and down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of"
entering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to
"their staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some"
way caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and
stepped through it into the control room.

"Then, as if in a very vexing dream, she could almost but never quite"
"see, through the thickening mist of the years, once-familiar"
"faces--white men, with swords, in ragged uniforms, and big brown ones"
"with wicked eyes and long, thin guns, glaring down at her over a high"
"wall, through smoke and fire, and fighting, and the acrid reek of"
powder....
"And there remembrance grew blank altogether, until it connected with"
"Captain Dove, on the deck of a slaving-dhow far out of sight of any"
land. She had been only a little child when he had carried her up the
"side of his own ship in his arms, while she laughed gleefully in his"
"face and pulled at his shaggy moustache, but she could still remember"
some of the incidents of that day.
"She had lived on board his successive ships ever since. And ever since,"
"until recently, he had always been very good to her, in his own queer,"
gruff way. He had always treated her as though she were a child of his
"own, shielding her, in so far as he could, from even the knowledge of"
all the evil which he had done up and down the world. She had grown up
in the belief that his despotic guardianship was altogether for her good
and not to be disputed.
"But now--she was no longer a child. And all her old, unquestioning faith"
"in his inherent good intentions, toward her at least, was finally"
shattered. She knew now that he really looked upon her as a mere
"chattel, with a cash value--just as if she had been one of the hapless"
cargo of human cattle confined in the pestiferous hold of the dhow on
whose deck he had found her at play. She knew now that he had bought and
"paid for them as well as her, and sold them again at a fat profit, far"
"across the seas--all but the dumb, deformed black woman whom he had"

"President.  At the right of the head of the Republic, who was"
"distinguishable by his crimson sash, sat the Countess Tornelli, with the"
wife of the United States Ambassador on his left.  The President's
"wife--who wore a superb gown of corn-coloured miroir velvet, richly"
"embroidered and inlaid with Venetian lace, a veritable triumph of the"
"Rue de la Paix--had on her right the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Lerenzelli,"
"the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps, while on her left was my Chief, Lord"
Barmouth.
"The seat next me was allotted to his daughter Sibyl, who looked charming"
"in rose chiffon.  During dinner she chatted merrily, describing a"
charity bazaar which she had attended that afternoon accompanied by her
"mother.  On the other side of her sat Count Berchtold, the secretary of"
"the Austrian Embassy, who was, I shrewdly suspected, one of her most"
"devoted admirers.  She was charming--a typical, smart English girl; and"
I think that I was proved to be an exception among men by reason of the
"fact that I did not flirt with her.  Indeed, we were excellent friends,"
and my long acquaintance with her gave me a prescriptive right to a kind
of brotherly solicitude for her welfare.  Times without number I had
"chaffed her about her little affairs of the heart, and as many times she"
had turned my criticisms against myself by her witty repartee.  She
could be exceedingly sarcastic when occasion required; but there had
"always been a perfect understanding between us, and no remark was ever"
distorted into an insult.
Dinner was followed by a brilliant reception.  The great Salon des
"Fetes, which only a year before was hung with funeral wreaths, owing to"
"the death of the previous President, resounded with that peculiar hum"
made up of all the intonations of conversation and discreet laughter
rolled together against the sustained buzzing of the orchestra a short
distance away.  The scene was one of glittering magnificence.  Everyone
knew everyone else.  Through the crowd of uniforms--which always give an
"monthly, which arose fairly directly out of erudite correspondence. It"
"was, as in antiquity--which in this respect was imitated better and more"
"profitably, perhaps, than in any other sphere--an art. Even before 1500"
"Erasmus had, at Paris, described that art in the treatise, _De"
"conscribendis epistolis_, which was to appear in print in 1522. People"
"wrote, as a rule, with a view to later publication, for a wider circle,"
"or at any rate, with the certainty that the recipient would show the"
"letter to others. A fine Latin letter was a gem, which a man envied his"
neighbour. Erasmus writes to Budaeus: 'Tunstall has devoured your letter
to me and re-read it as many as three or four times; I had literally to
tear it from his hands.'
Unfortunately fate did not always take into consideration the author's
"intentions as to publicity, semi-publicity or strict secrecy. Often"
"letters passed through many hands before reaching their destination, as"
did Servatius's letter to Erasmus in 1514. 'Do be careful about
"letters,' he writes more than once; 'waylayers are on the lookout to"
"intercept them.' Yet, with the curious precipitation that characterizes"
"him, Erasmus was often very careless as to what he wrote. From an early"
"age he preserved and cared for his letters, yet nevertheless, through"
"his itinerant life, many were lost. He could not control their"
publication. As early as 1509 a friend sent him a manuscript volume of
"his own (Erasmus's) letters, that he had picked up for sale at Rome."
Erasmus had it burnt at once. Since 1515 he himself superintended the
publication of his letters; at first only a few important ones;
"afterwards in 1516 a selection of letters from friends to him, and after"
"that ever larger collections till, at the end of his life, there"
appeared a new collection almost every year. No article was so much in
"demand on the book market as letters by Erasmus, and no wonder. They"
"were models of excellent style, tasteful Latin, witty expression and"
elegant erudition.
THE MEETING PLACE OF THE CAYUCAS]
"Once a week Miguel’s father went down to market at Matachin, and"
"sometimes the boy went along. The long, narrow cayuca was loaded with"
"oranges, bananas and yams, all covered with big banana leaves, and with"
Miguel in the bow and his father in the stern the voyage commenced.
"Going down stream was easy enough, and the canoists plied their paddles"
"idly, trusting chiefly to the current to carry them along. But coming"
"back would be the real work, then they would have to bend to their poles"
and push savagely to force the boat along. At places they would have to
"get overboard and fairly carry the boat through the swift, shallow"
rapids. But Miguel welcomed the work for it showed him the wonders of
"Matachin, where great iron machines rushed along like horses, drawing"
long trains of cars; where more people worked with shovels tending queer
machines than there were in ten towns like Cruces; where folk gave pesos
"for bananas and gave cloth, powder and shot, things to eat in cans, and"
rum in big bottles for the pesos again. It was an exciting place this
Matachin and made Miguel understand what the gringoes meant when they
"talked about New York, Chicago and other cities like it."
[Illustration: BANANA MARKET AT MATACHIN]
When he grew older Miguel worked awhile for the men who were digging
"away all this dirt, and earned enough to buy himself a machete and a gun"
and a few ornaments for a girl named Maria who lived in another hut near
the river. But what was the use of working in that mad way--picking up
"your shovel when a whistle blew and toiling away until it blew again,"
with a boss always scolding at you and ready with a kick if you tried to
"take a little siesta. The pesos once a week were good, that was true. If"
you worked long enough you might get enough to buy one of those boxes
"that made music, but _quien sabe?_ It might get broken anyway, and the"
self. I’m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.”
"When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a"
"promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience"
the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.
The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down
"Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables"
"were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good"
"orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible"
"pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His"
"companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air"
that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.
"And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but"
"self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with"
something not far from admiration in her own charming face.
"Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and"
"Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized"
"upon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style,"
and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had
assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an
"idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good"
angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.
"So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and"
riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints
of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly
"impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random"
"insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few"
names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler’s
"short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be"
"BRACHIOPODS. These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and"
"two interior armlike processes which served for breathing,"
"appeared in the Algonkian, and had now become very abundant. The"
"two valves of the brachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in"
each valve a line drawn from the beak to the base divides the
valve into two equal parts. It may thus be told from the pelecypod
"mollusk, such as the clam, whose two valves are not far from equal"
"in size, each being divided into unequal parts by a line dropped"
from the beak.
Brachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that
of the INARTICULATE brachiopods--the two valves are held together
"only by muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is"
"composed of phosphate of lime. The DISCINA, which began in the"
"Algonkian, is of this type, as is also the LINGULELLA of the"
Cambrian. Both of these genera have lived on during the millions
"of years of geological time since their introduction, handing down"
from generation to generation with hardly any change to their
descendants now living off our shores the characters impressed
upon them at the beginning.
The more highly organized ARTICULATE brachiopods have valves of
carbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and
"sockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,"
though the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.
MOLLUSKS. The three chief classes of mollusks--the PELECYPODS
"(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the GASTROPODS"
"(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the"
"CEPHALOPODS (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were"
"all represented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly."
"kaloma!"" She looked closer, and said: ""Oh no, you are not red. Your"
"name is momoka."" She took then the stick with the kaloma discs and"
"thrust it into a hole of the reef. It stood there, but when she looked"
"at it, she said: ""Oh, the people from inland would come and see you"
"and pluck you off."" She went, she pulled out the stick; she went into"
"a canoe, and she paddled. She paddled out into the sea. She anchored"
"there, pulled the discs off the stick, and she threw them into the"
"sea so that they might come into the coral outcrop. She said: ""It"
is forbidden that the inland natives should take the valuables. The
"people of Sinaketa only must dive."" Thus only the Sinaketa people"
"know the magic, and how to dive."
This myth presents certain remarkable characteristics. I shall not
"enter into its sociology, though it differs in that respect from"
"the Kiriwinian myths, in which the equality of the Sinaketan and the"
Gumilababan chiefs with those of Omarakana is not acknowledged. It is
characteristic that the Malasi woman in this myth shows an aversion to
"the dog, the totem animal of the Lukuba clan, a clan which according"
to mythical and historical data had to recede before and yield its
"priority to the Malasi (compare Chapter XII, Division IV). Another"
"detail of interest is that she brings the kaloma on their sticks,"
"as they appear in the final stage of manufacturing. In this form,"
"also, she tries to plant them on the reef. The finished kaloma,"
"however, to use the words of one of my informants, ""looked at her,"
"the water swinging it to and fro; flashing its red eyes."" And the"
"woman, seeing it, pulls out the too accessible and too inviting"
kaloma and scatters them over the deep sea. Thus she makes them
"inaccessible to the uninitiated inland villagers, and monopolises them"
for Sinaketa. There can be no doubt that the villages of Vakuta have
learnt this industry from the Sinaketans. The myth is hardly known in
"Vakuta, only a few are experts in diving and manufacturing; there is"
a tradition about a late transference of this industry there; finally
"routes, but without much success, owing to the inhospitable nature of"
the country through which they had to pass and also to the opposition
"they met with from the Hazara tribes round Herat, who, belonging"
"as they do to the Shiah section of the Mahommedan religion, are at"
"daggers drawn with the Afghans, who belong to the Sunni section."
"Therefore the Germans had to try yet another road, and succeeded"
farther South where they had failed in the North. By taking the
longer route through Kerman and Narmashir in the South and South-East
"of Persia, they found easy ingress into Afghanistan."
"To effect this, however, they had to make friends with the nomad"
and war-like tribes of the Sarhad. These tribes were traditionally
"friendly to the British, but the Germans had bribed them heavily"
and had moreover assured them that Germany had turned Islam and
that the Kaiser William himself was a convert to their religion. As
"the Sarhad tribes were always out for a good thing for themselves,"
"and as they believed the lie about the German conversion, they had"
allowed themselves to be tricked into helping the Germans. This
they were doing not only by permitting them to pass through their
"territory, but also by harassing the lines of communication between"
the inadequately small British frontier posts.
"The story of Germany having turned Mahommedan, farcical as it was,"
was nevertheless a potential source of grave danger for us in India.
"It must be remembered that Germany's ally, Turkey, was Mahommedan,"
"and that in helping us against Germany, the Mahommedans of India were"
"already being called upon, indirectly, to fight against their own"
"co-religionists. When, in addition, India was assured that powerful"
"Germany was winning, so her agents avowed, in every theatre of war,"
it was inevitable that in time her loyalty to us must suffer.

explicit.
At the present recruitment in the Indian Educational Service is made in
England and is practically confined to Englishmen. Such racial
"preference is in my opinion, prejudicial to the interest of education."
"The best man available, English or Indian should be selected"
"impartially, and high scholarship should be the only test."
It has been said that the present standard of Indian Universities is
"not as high as that of British Universities, and that the work done by"
the former is more like that of a sixth form of public schools in
England. It is therefore urged that what is required for an Educational
officer is the capacity to manage classes rather than high scholarship.
I do not agree with these views: (1) there are Universities in Great
Britain whose standards are not higher than ours; I do not think that
the Pass Degree even of Oxford or Cambridge is higher than the
corresponding degree here; (2) the standard of the Indian Universities
is being steadily raised; (3) the standard will depend upon what the men
entrusted with Educational work will make it. For these reasons it is
necessary that the level of scholarship represented by the Indian
Educational Service should be maintained very high.
"In paragraph 83,631 I have stated that even these Indians who have"
distinguished themselves in European Universities have little chance of
entering the higher Educational Service. I should like to add that these
highly qualified Indians need only opportunities to render service which
would greatly advance the cause of higher education. As regards
"graduates of Indian Universities, I have known men among them whose"
works have been highly appreciated. If promising Indian graduates are
"given the opportunity of visiting foreign Universities, I have no doubt"
that they would stand comparison with the best recruits that can be
obtained from the West.
the insecurity deter him. In England the servitude which was required of
"him there revolted him. But in the Netherlands themselves, he did not"
"feel at his ease, either: 'Here I am barked at a great deal, and there"
"is no remuneration; though I desired it ever so much, I could not bear"
to stay there long'. Yet he remained for four years.
Erasmus had good friends in the University of Louvain. At first he put
"up with his old host Johannes Paludanus, Rhetor of the University, whose"
house he exchanged that summer for quarters in the College of the Lily.
"Martin Dorp, a Dutchman like himself, had not been estranged from him by"
their polemics about the _Moria_; his good will was of great importance
"to Erasmus, because of the important place Dorp occupied in the"
"theological faculty. And lastly, though his old patron, Adrian of"
"Utrecht, afterwards Pope, had by that time been called away from Louvain"
"to higher dignities, his influence had not diminished in consequence,"
but rather increased; for just about that time he had been made a
cardinal.
Erasmus was received with great complaisance by the Louvain divines.
"Their leader, the vice-chancellor of the University, Jean Briard of Ath,"
"repeatedly expressed his approval of the edition of the New Testament,"
to Erasmus's great satisfaction. Soon Erasmus found himself a member of
the theological faculty. Yet he did not feel at his ease among the
Louvain theologians. The atmosphere was a great deal less congenial to
him than that of the world of the English scholars. Here he felt a
spirit which he did not understand and distrusted in consequence.
"In the years in which the Reformation began, Erasmus was the victim of a"
"great misunderstanding, the result of the fact that his delicate,"
"aesthetic, hovering spirit understood neither the profoundest depths of"
the faith nor the hard necessities of human society. He was neither
mystic nor realist. Luther was both. To Erasmus the great problem of
calls himself in writing to Colet. But again he cannot help giving
"himself credit for acknowledging that quality, nay, converting that"
"quality itself into a virtue: it is modesty, the opposite of boasting"
and self-love.
This bashfulness about himself is the reason that he does not love his
"own physiognomy, and is only persuaded with difficulty by his friends to"
sit for a portrait. His own appearance is not heroic or dignified enough
"for him, and he is not duped by an artist who flatters him: 'Heigh-ho,'"
"he exclaims, on seeing Holbein's thumbnail sketch illustrating the"
"_Moria_: 'if Erasmus still looked like that, he would take a wife at"
once'. It is that deep trait of dissatisfaction that suggests the
inscription on his portraits: 'his writings will show you a better
image'.
Erasmus's modesty and the contempt which he displays of the fame that
fell to his lot are of a somewhat rhetorical character. But in this we
should not so much see a personal trait of Erasmus as a general form
"common to all humanists. On the other hand, this mood cannot be called"
"altogether artificial. His books, which he calls his children, have not"
turned out well. He does not think they will live. He does not set store
by his letters: he publishes them because his friends insist upon it. He
writes his poems to try a new pen. He hopes that geniuses will soon
"appear who will eclipse him, so that Erasmus will pass for a stammerer."
What is fame? A pagan survival. He is fed up with it to repletion and
would do nothing more gladly than cast it off.
Sometimes another note escapes him. If Lee would help him in his
"endeavours, Erasmus would make him immortal, he had told the former in"
"their first conversation. And he threatens an unknown adversary, 'If you"
"go on so impudently to assail my good name, then take care that my"
"gentleness does not give way and I cause you to be ranked, after a"
"""I promise you, Colonel, the maid will be worth her billet,"" said the"
"Sergeant, ""or else she is no true Andaluse. To such an one in old days I"
"have often trusted----"""
Thus far Cardono had proceeded when suddenly he broke off his
"reminiscence, and with a paternal gesture patted Concha's arm as she was"
bending over to transfer a second helping of the _puchero_ to his dish.
"The party was now in excellent marching order, well-provisioned,"
"well-fed, rested, and provided with the best and most recent"
information. Even John Mortimer's slow English blood developed some
"latent Puritanic fire, and he said, ""Hang me if I do not fight for the"
"little girl who was willing to pay for the _whole_ of the goat-milk!"""
"To fight for a Queen, who at the early age of five was prepared to give"
"a wholesale order like that, appeared to John Mortimer a worthy and"
laudable deed of arms. He was free indeed to assist in taking her
"captive, if by so doing he could further the shipping of the Priorato he"
himself had paid for. But to make over to a set of thieves and murderers
a girl who had about her the makings of a good customer and a woman of
"business habits, stirred every chivalric feeling within him."
The night was so dark that it was resolved that the party should leave
their horses behind them in the stables of the deserted farm. They could
then proceed on foot more softly and with more safety to themselves. To
"this La Giralda, knowing that they must return that way, readily"
assented. For the thought of the dead woman she had left in the
"first-floor room haunted her, and even in the darkness of the night she"
could see the stark outlines of the sheet she had spread over the body.
"So it came to pass that once more horseshoe iron clattered, and there"
was a flashing of lights and a noise of voices about the lonely and
"there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ""I will tell you"
"what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ""You must go to the rock behind"
"the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock"
"with it. Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell"
"him your business. And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him"
"as much as you can carry."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until"
"evening, and he might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not"
reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before
"the giant came home. So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl"
"had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it."
"Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ""What do you"
"want?"" he asked. ""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the"
"king's son. ""How much do you want?"" the other again inquired. ""I never"
"ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ""It is"
"lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the"
"one on the hill. ""But come in with me, and wait a while."" This the"
"king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the"
hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could carry was
"packed up, and with it he went his way. When the giant came home in"
"the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room,"
"whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ""Did you go to"
"the devil for the tribute?"" asked the giant. ""Yes, indeed, master,"" said"
"the king's son. ""Where did you put it?"" asked the giant again. ""I stood"
"the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ""I must see that"
"at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the sack was"
"really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver"
"rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ""You surely must"
"have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ""If that is the case I"
"will tear your head off."" ""With your Master Girl?"" said the king's"
"son. ""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is"
"talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about"
the queen and her train of ladies to the place kept for her. Guards were
put all about to prevent the people crowding; and then came the
"soldiers, and in the midst of them the blacksmith; and amid many cries"
"of 'Traitor, traitor!' and shouts of derision, he was bound to the iron"
"post within the wood and the straw, and the guards fell back."
"The queen sat and watched it all, and said never a word. Fire was put to"
"the pyre, and it crept rapidly up in long red tongues with coils of"
"black smoke. It went very quickly, for the wood was very dry, and a"
light breeze came laughing up the river and helped it. The flames played
"about the man chained there in the midst, and he made never a sign; only"
"he looked steadily across at the purple mountain where his home lay, and"
it was clear that in a few more moments he would be dead. There was a
deep silence everywhere.
"Then of a sudden, before anyone knew, before a hand could be held out to"
"hinder her, the queen rose from her seat and ran to the pyre. In a"
"moment she was there and had thrown herself into the flames, and with"
her arms about her brother's neck she turned and faced the myriad eyes
"that glared upon them--the queen, in all the glory of her beauty,"
"glittering with gems, and the man with great shackled bare limbs,"
"dressed in a few rags, his muscles already twisted with the agony of the"
"fire. A great cry of horror came from the people, and there was the"
movement of guards and officers rushing to stop the fire; but it was all
"of no use. A flash of red flames came out of the logs, folding these"
"twain like an imperial cloak, a whirl of sparks towered into the air,"
and when one could see again the woman and her brother were no longer
"there. They were dead and burnt, and the bodies mingled with the ashes"
"of the fire. She had cost her brother his life, and she went with him"
into death.
but I find that if I continue to do this I shall have but little time
for anything else.
The very unexpected welcome which the book has received prompts me to
take this plan and means of replying to many who have honored me by
"writing me personal letters. First, permit me to thank those who have"
"written letters of praise and gratitude, and to say that, although I may"
"be unable to reply in a private letter, I am not indifferent to these"
"evidences of your interest, and am greatly helped in my work by your"
sympathy and encouragement. I have also received most courteous letters
"from various clergymen who, disagreeing with me, desire to convert me"
either by mail or personal (private) interviews.
"It is wholly impossible for me to grant these requests, since my time"
"and strength are demanded in other work, but I wish to say here what I"
"have written to several of my clerical correspondents, and desire to say"
to them all.
"Although I cannot enter into private correspondence with, nor grant"
"personal interviews to, such a number of your body, I am entirely"
willing to respond in a public way to any replies to my arguments which
come under the following conditions:
1. On page fourteen of the introduction to my book Col. Ingersoll says:
"""No human being can answer her arguments. There is no answer. All the"
priests in the world cannot explain away her objections. There is no
explanation. They should remain dumb unless they can show that the
"impossible is the probable, that slavery is better than freedom, that"
"polygamy is the friend of woman, that the innocent can justly suffer for"
"the guilty, and that to persecute for opinion's sake is an act of love"
"and worship."""
primitive symbolic tendency to objectify the subjective. Men have taken
"out of their own hearts their best feelings and their worst feelings,"
"and have personalised and dramatised them, bowed down to them or stamped"
"on them, unable to hear the voice with which each of their images spoke:"
"'I am thyself.' Our conceptions of religion, of morals, of many of the"
"mightiest phenomena of life, especially the more exceptional phenomena,"
"have grown up under this influence, which still serves to support many"
movements of to-day by some people imagined to be modern.
"Dreaming, as we have seen, is not the sole source of such conceptions."
"But they could scarcely have been found convincing, and possibly could"
"not even have arisen, among races which were wholly devoid of dream"
"experiences. A large part of all progress in psychological knowledge,"
"and, indeed, a large part of civilisation itself, lies in realising that"
"the apparently objective is really subjective, that the angels and demons"
and geniuses of all sorts that once seemed to be external forces taking
possession of feeble and vacant individualities are themselves but modes
of action of marvellously rich and varied personalities. In our dreams we
"are brought back into the magic circle of early culture, and we shrink and"
shudder in the presence of imaginative phantoms that are built up of our
"own thoughts and emotions, and are really our own flesh."

"The arguments rose furiously again, some maintaining that Medland must"
"disappear altogether, others vehemently denying it, a third party"
preferring to await the disclosures at the inquest before committing
themselves to an opinion. An hour passed; the noise in the streets began
"to abate, and the clock of the Roman Catholic cathedral hard by struck"
"twelve. Captain Heseltine yawned, stretched, and rose to his feet."
"shrapnel, had perforated the arm, which the patient was sure was by his"
"side at the moment of injury, and the X-rays showed it to lie at the"
"bottom of the pleural cavity, where we assumed it had fallen. When,"
"however, the bullet was removed by Mr. Watson, he found that the fixed"
pain and tenderness had been the result of a fracture of a rib from the
"inner side, not involving loss of continuity; hence the actual"
"indication for the operation had been a delusive one, since the bullet"
"had not fallen, but expended its last force in injuring the rib. The"
"patient made an excellent recovery, and rejoined his regiment at the end"
of six weeks. I saw several cases in which the bullet was lodged in
either the lung or bones of the spine do well with no interference. The
great disadvantage of primary removal in inducing an artificial
pneumo-thorax and in laying open a hæmothorax is obvious.
"In case of lodgment of the bullet in the lung, bearing in mind the"
"infrequency of untoward symptoms, the latter should be watched for prior"
to interference.
The following cases illustrate some typical instances of wound of chest
accompanied by the development of hæmothorax:--

"which reached 102° on the fourth day, and on the evening of the"
The young man had not been a fortnight in town before finding his
"capital doubled, as well as all bills paid to the astonished tradesmen,"
who seldom looked to receive their money within a twelvemonth.  He was
disposed to be troubled at this easy fashion of making money; but Lord
Sandford laughed him to scorn.
"""Zounds, man, what does it matter?  Those young popinjays are bound to"
lose their money to some one. Why not then to honest fellows like you
"and me, who pay our bills and do good to the community with the money?"
Scruples!  Faugh! you must rid yourself of them!  Sir Hugh Dumaresq’s
"son need not trouble himself thus.  Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow"
"we die.  Isn’t that good Scripture?""  But the reckless young lord paled"
a little at the sound of his own words.  He had seen sudden death once
too often for his peace of mind of late.
"In sooth, Grey felt but little scruple in taking his winnings.  The"
"young man was not greatly in advance of his age, although he was indued"
with a nature more finely strung and aspirations more lofty than
belonged to most.  Gambling was so much a matter of course both in this
"and in other lands, and the devotees of the amusement so numerous and so"
"bent upon their sport, that it would have needed stronger convictions"
than Grey as yet possessed to make any stand on such a point.  He took
"the same risks as the others, and if his coolness of head, steadiness of"
"hand, and quick observation and memory served to make for success in his"
"case, he rather regarded this as a witness to his superiority, and felt"
only a small sense of reluctance in pocketing his gains; which
reluctance he could only attribute to a lingering memory of words spoken
"by his mother when he was a growing boy, and news came to them from time"
"to time of Sir Hugh’s losses over cards, and the necessity for further"
retrenchments upon the already impoverished estate.
"When Winton had left him, an hour and a half later that afternoon,"
"Fiorsen continued to stand at the front door, swaying his body to and"
fro.  The brandy-nurtured burst of jealousy which had made him insult his
wife and old Monsieur Harmost had died suddenly when Gyp turned on him in
"the street and spoke in that icy voice; since then he had felt fear,"
increasing every minute.  Would she forgive?  To one who always acted on
"the impulse of the moment, so that he rarely knew afterward exactly what"
"he had done, or whom hurt, Gyp's self-control had ever been mysterious"
and a little frightening. Where had she gone?  Why did she not come in?
"Anxiety is like a ball that rolls down-hill, gathering momentum.  Suppose"
she did not come back!  But she must--there was the baby--their baby!
"For the first time, the thought of it gave him unalloyed satisfaction."
"He left the door, and, after drinking a glass to steady him, flung"
"himself down on the sofa in the drawing-room. And while he lay there, the"
"brandy warm within him, he thought: 'I will turn over a new leaf; give up"
"drink, give up everything, send the baby into the country, take Gyp to"
"Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Rome--anywhere out of this England, anywhere, away"
"from that father of hers and all these stiff, dull folk!  She will like"
"that--she loves travelling!'  Yes, they would be happy!  Delicious"
nights--delicious days--air that did not weigh you down and make you feel
that you must drink--real inspiration--real music!  The acrid wood-smoke
"scent of Paris streets, the glistening cleanness of the Thiergarten, a"
"serenading song in a Florence back street, fireflies in the summer dusk"
at Sorrento--he had intoxicating memories of them all!  Slowly the warmth
"of the brandy died away, and, despite the heat, he felt chill and"
"shuddery.  He shut his eyes, thinking to sleep till she came in.  But"
"very soon he opened them, because--a thing usual with him of late--he saw"
"such ugly things--faces, vivid, changing as he looked, growing ugly and"
"uglier, becoming all holes--holes--horrible holes--Corruption--matted,"
"twisted, dark human-tree-roots of faces!  Horrible!  He opened his eyes,"
"for when he did that, they always went.  It was very silent.  No sound"
CHAPTER III
PHILOSOPHY BEFORE FERRIER'S DAY
In attempting to give some idea of philosophy as it was in Scotland in
"the earlier portion of the present century, we shall have to go back"
"two hundred years or thereabout, in order to find a satisfactory basis"
"from which to start. For philosophy, as no one realised more than"
"Ferrier, is no arbitrary succession of systems following one upon"
another as their propounders might decree; it is a development in the
truest and highest significance of that word. It means the gradual
working out of the questions which reason sets to be answered; and
"though it seems as if we had sometimes to turn our faces backwards, and"
"to revert to systems of bygone days, we always find, when we look more"
"closely, that in our onward course we have merely dropped some thread"
"in our web, the recovery of which is requisite in order that it may be"
duly taken up and woven with the rest.
"At the time of which we write the so-called 'Scottish School' of Reid,"
"Stewart, and Beattie reigned supreme in orthodox Scotland; it had"
"undisputed power in the Universities, and besides this obtained a very"
"reputable place in the estimation of Europe, and more especially of"
France. As it was this school more especially that Ferrier spent much
"of his time in combating, it is its history and place that we wish"
"shortly to describe. To do so, however, it is needful to go back to its"
"real founder, Locke, in order that its point of view may fairly be set"
forth.
"curious name of the _Protestant Cæsar_, the pirates burnt out of spite,"
"not because of her name, but because she belonged to Boston, where there"
had lately been a hanging of pirates.
"Blackbeard now sailed north along the American coast, arriving off"
"Charleston, South Carolina. Here he lay off the bar for several days,"
"seizing every vessel that attempted to enter or leave the port, ""striking"
"great Terror to the whole Province of Carolina,"" the more so since the"
"colony was scarcely recovered from a recent visit by another pirate, Vane."
"Being in want of medicines, Teach sent his lieutenant, Richards, on shore"
with a letter to the Governor demanding that he should instantly send off
"a medicine chest, or else Teach would murder all his prisoners, and"
threatening to send their heads to Government House; many of these
prisoners being the chief persons of the colony.
"Teach, who was unprincipled, even for a pirate, now commanded three"
"vessels, and he wanted to get rid of his crews and keep all the booty for"
"himself and a few chosen friends. To do this, he contrived to wreck his"
own vessel and one of his sloops. Then with his friends and all the booty
"he sailed off, leaving the rest marooned on a small sandy island. Teach"
"next sailed to North Carolina, and with the greatest coolness surrendered"
"with twenty of his men to the Governor, Charles Eden, and received the"
Royal pardon. The ex-pirate spent the next few weeks in cultivating an
"intimate friendship with the Governor, who, no doubt, shared Teach's booty"
with him.
A romantic episode took place at this time at Bath Town. The pirate fell
"in love, not by any means for the first time, with a young lady of 16"
"years of age. To show his delight at this charming union, the Governor"
"himself married the happy pair, this being the captain's fourteenth wife;"
though certain Bath Town gossips were heard to say that there were no
"with fifteen thousand of his soldiers around him, lifted this same"
"Iron Crown of Lombardy into their view, and placed it upon his brow,"
"saying, ""God has given it to me, let him touch it who dares!"""
[Sidenote: High Reflections and Hard Cash.]
"That men who, like Charlemagne and Napoleon, had reached the highest"
"pinnacle of human power, should seek to enhance their influence by"
"crowning their heads with one of the nails which, as their followers"
"believed, had pierced the Galilean's foot, is a richly suggestive fact."
But we must keep our tempted thoughts to another and less edifying line
at present.
When we had examined all the parts of the famous crown to our
"satisfaction, we stepped to the desk in the ante-room and paid our five"
"francs (one dollar), the regular price for the exhibition of the Iron"
"Crown, then left the cathedral, bought one or two post-card pictures of"
"the crown, and took the tram through the dreary weather back to Milan,"
well pleased with the results of our first pilgrimage to the shrine of
a real Roman Catholic relic in Italy.
[Sidenote: Rome Caps the Climax.]
"But on our arrival at Rome, a month later, we found that, interesting"
"as were the relics which we had seen or read of elsewhere, they were"
"nothing to those in the Eternal City itself. In this, as in everything"
else except such little matters as cleanliness and morality and
"truthfulness and honesty, Rome outvies all her rivals. It is only fair"
"to add, however, that, since the overthrow of the papal sovereignty and"
"the establishment of a capable government, Rome has improved immensely"
"in the matter of cleanliness, and even her immorality is not so"
"flaunting as it was. This is attested by the Hon. Guiseppe Zanardelli,"
"policeman into a skilled worker at a moment's notice. How is it done?"""
"""He begins at the other end. All his skilled workmen are the best he"
can pick out of their various trades. They have served their full time
as apprentices and journeymen. They are recommended to him by their
"employers after careful testing and sounding. Most of them, I believe,"
come from the Government dockyards and ordnance factories. They are
"given a course of police training at Scotland Yard, and then dropped"
"down wherever they may be wanted. Dawson, and inspectors like him,"
"have these men everywhere--in shipyards, in shell shops, in gun"
"factories, in aeroplane sheds, everywhere. They take a leading part in"
"the councils of the unions wherever they go, for they add to their"
"skill as workmen a pronounced, even blatant parade of loyalty to the"
interests of trade unions and a tasty flavour of socialist principles.
"Dawson is perfectly cynically outspoken to me over the business which,"
"I confess, appals me. In his female agents--of which he has many--he"
favours what he calls a 'judicious frailty'; in his male agents he
favours a subtle skill in the verbal technique of anarchism. And this
"man Dawson is by religion a Peculiar Baptist, in private life a"
"faithful husband and a loving father, and in politics a strict Liberal"
"of the Manchester School! As a man he is good, honest, and rather"
"narrow; as a professional detective he is base and mean, utterly"
"without scruple, and a Jesuit of Jesuits. With him the end justifies"
"the means, whatever the means may be."""
"""And yet you admit that his value to the country is beyond payment."
Dawson--our remarkable Dawson of the double life in the two
"compartments, professional and private, which never are allowed to"
overlap--Dawson is an instrument of war. We do not like using gas or
"liquid fire, but we are compelled to use them. We do not like"
"espionage, but we must employ it. As one who loves this fair land of"
"England beyond everything in the world, and as one who would do"
"thousand years, among the venomous sycophants, among the idle boasters,"
among the incompetent physicians'.
The self-centred element in Erasmus must needs increase accordingly as
he in truth became a centre and objective point of ideas and culture.
There really was a time when it must seem to him that the world hinged
"upon him, and that it awaited the redeeming word from him. What a"
"widespread enthusiastic following he had, how many warm friends and"
venerators! There is something naïve in the way in which he thinks it
"requisite to treat all his friends, in an open letter, to a detailed,"
rather repellent account of an illness that attacked him on the way back
"from Basle to Louvain. _His_ part, _his_ position, _his_ name, this more"
and more becomes the aspect under which he sees world-events. Years will
come in which his whole enormous correspondence is little more than one
protracted self-defence.
Yet this man who has so many friends is nevertheless solitary at heart.
And in the depth of that heart he desires to be alone. He is of a most
retiring disposition; he is _a recluse_. 'I have always wished to be
"alone, and there is nothing I hate so much as sworn partisans.' Erasmus"
is one of those whom contact with others weakens. The less he has to
"address and to consider others, friends or enemies, the more truly he"
utters his deepest soul. Intercourse with particular people always
"causes little scruples in him, intentional amenities, coquetry,"
"reticences, reserves, spiteful hits, evasions. Therefore it should not"
be thought that we get to know him to the core from his letters. Natures
"like his, which all contact with men unsettles, give their best and"
deepest when they speak impersonally and to all.
After the early effusions of sentimental affection he no longer opens
his heart unreservedly to others. At bottom he feels separated from all
and on the alert towards all. There is a great fear in him that others
"between 'our apprehension' and 'the perception-of-matter,' the latter"
"being one fact and indivisible, and on no account to be taken as two"
"separate facts or thoughts. The whole point is, that by no possible"
means can the perception-of-matter be divided into two facts or
"existences, as was done by psychology. And Ferrier goes on to point out"
"that this is not a subjective idealism, it is not a condition of the"
"human soul alone, but it 'dwells apart, a mighty and independent"
"system, a city fitted up and upheld by the living God.' And in"
"authenticating this last belief Ferrier calls in internal convictions,"
"'common-sense,' to assist the evidence of speculative reason, where,"
"had he followed more upon the lines of the great German Idealists, he"
might have done without it.
"Now, Ferrier continues, we are safe against the cavils of scepticism;"
the metaphysical theory of perception steers clear of all the
perplexities of representationalism; for it gives us in perception one
"only object, the perception of matter; the objectivity of this _datum_"
keeps us clear from subjective idealism.
"From the perception of matter, a fact in which man merely participates,"
"Ferrier infers a Divine mind, of which perceptions are the property:"
they are states of the everlasting intellect. The exercise of the
senses is the condition upon which we are permitted to apprehend or
"participate in the objective perception of material things. This,"
"shortly, is the position from which he starts."
CHAPTER IV
'FIERCE WARRES AND FAITHFUL LOVES'
"once we are to renounce our reason, or trust to it only within a"
"certain sphere, all hope for us is lost, as far as withstanding the"
attack of outside enemies is concerned. We are liable to sceptical
"attacks from every side, and all we can maintain against them is a"
"personal conviction which is not proof. How, then, was the difficulty"
met?
[6] _Philosophy of the Unconditioned_ (Sir William
"Hamilton), p. 15."
"Kant, as we have said, made an important development upon the position"
of Hume. Hume had arrived at the point of declaring the particular mind
and matter equally incompetent to afford an ultimate explanation of
"things, and he suggested experience in their place. This is the first"
"note of the new philosophy: experience, not a process of the"
"interaction of two separate things, mind on the one hand, matter on the"
"other, but something comprehending both. This, however, was scarcely"
"realised either by Hume or Kant, though the latter came very near the"
"formulation of it. Kant saw, at least, that things could not produce"
"knowledge, and he therefore changed his front and suggested starting"
with the knowledge that was before regarded as result--a change in
point of view that caused a revolution in thought similar to that
caused in our ideas of the natural world by the introduction of the
"system of Copernicus. Still, while following out his Copernican theory,"
Kant did not go far enough. His methods were still somewhat
psychological in nature. He still regarded thought as something which
can be separated from the thinker; he still maintained the existence of
things in themselves independent and outside of thought. He gives us a
"'theory' of knowledge, when what we want to reach is knowledge itself,"
and not a subjective conception of it.
Here it is that the Absolute Idealism comes in--the Idealism most
"Unusual words, proper names, and figures should be written out with the"
greatest care and distinctness by the author.
"It is for the common advantage of the author, the publisher, and the"
printer that the author or the editor read all proofs promptly.
ESTIMATING THE MANUSCRIPT
The usual procedure in making a book is as follows: When the publisher
"sends the manuscript to the printer, a request goes with it for a"
"sample page, set to a size and in a type which will make a volume of"
the desired number of pages. A novel is supposed to run from 320 pages
to 400 pages. The first thing to be done is to estimate the number of
"words in the manuscript, and this is accomplished by averaging the"
"number of words in say thirty lines, and then multiplying by the number"
"of lines on a page. No allowance is made for fractional lines, as these"
"also occur in the printed page. If the manuscript is carefully written,"
"each page will contain the same number of lines, so the total number"
"of words may be found by multiplying the number of words on the page,"
"as arrived at above, by the total number of pages in the manuscript."
This explains the importance of having a standard number of lines on
each page.[32] No allowance is made for fractional pages at the end of
"chapters, as there are also fractional pages in the printed book, and"
it averages up.
"The front matter has to be estimated separately, with allowance for"
"the blanks on the reverse of bastard-title, dedication, etc.,[33] but"
"the usual number of pages is eight. Then, again, an allowance of half"
a page for each chapter sinkage[34] has to be made. Suppose we have a
"manuscript of 90,000 words, with 24 chapters: A type page of 280 words"
"gives us 322 pages, to which we add 8 pages for front and 12 pages"
men. The light had not been abandoned; it had simply burned itself out.
It was a fortunate circumstance that very little shipping frequents
"these seas during the winter, or there would have been one or two"
"marine disasters, as the islands are often wrapped in fog."
It is surmised that one of the men ventured outside on to a rocky ledge
"in the early hours of the morning. According to the log, a vicious"
"storm was raging at the time, and probably in the darkness the man was"
"swept off his feet and carried into the sea. The second keeper on duty,"
"marvelling at the non-return of his assistant, evidently had roused his"
"other companion, and the two had instituted a search in the storm, only"
in turn to be caught by a wave and carried away.
"In Great Britain, since 1860, men only have been employed by the"
"Trinity House Brethren for the maintenance of the lights, but in"
the United States women still are engaged in this duty. Some of the
British lights have been controlled by one family through two or
three generations. It was only a few years ago that a Darling retired
"from the vigil on the Longstones of Farne Islands, the scene of Grace"
"Darling’s heroism, while for a century and a half one family kept the"
"South Foreland light faithfully. The Casquets light off Alderney, in"
"the Channel Islands, was maintained by one family, some of the children"
"spending the whole of their lives on the rock, son succeeding father at"
the post of duty.
"On the American coast, however, women are more extensively employed."
Seeing that many of the lights are burned in a low tower projecting
"from the dwelling-house, this circumstance may be readily understood,"
as the duties beyond the maintenance of the light are not exacting.
"One of the most notable instances, however, is the Point Pino light"
"at the entrance to Monterey Bay, on the Californian coast, the"
guardianship of which has been in feminine hands for the past thirty
"But the dog only made a splash in the water with her paws, and then"
"turned and ran after me. The boatmen laughed and resumed their poling,"
and I passed on. In the still morning across the still water I could
"hear every word, but I hardly took any note; I have heard it so often."
Only now when I come to write on this subject do I remember.
It has been inculcated in us from childhood that it is a manly thing to
"be indifferent to pain--not to our own pain only, but to that of all"
"others. To be sorry for a hunted hare, to compassionate the wounded"
"deer, to shrink from torturing the brute creation, has been accounted by"
"us as namby-pamby sentimentalism, not fit for man, fit only for a"
squeamish woman. To the Burman it is one of the highest of all virtues.
He believes that all that is beautiful in life is founded on compassion
and kindness and sympathy--that nothing of great value can exist without
"them. Do you think that a Burmese boy would be allowed to birds'-nest,"
"or worry rats with a terrier, or go ferreting? Not so. These would be"
crimes.
That this kindness and compassion for animals has very far-reaching
"results no one can doubt. If you are kind to animals, you will be kind,"
"too, to your fellow-man. It is really the same thing, the same feeling"
in both cases. If to be superior in position to an animal justifies you
"in torturing it, so it would do with men. If you are in a better"
"position than another man, richer, stronger, higher in rank, that"
would--that does often in our minds--justify ill-treatment and contempt.
Our innate feeling towards all that we consider inferior to ourselves is
scorn; the Burman's is compassion. You can see this spirit coming out in
"every action of their daily life, in their dealings with each other, in"
"their thoughts, in their speech. 'You are so strong, have you no"
"compassion for him who is weak, who is tempted, who has fallen?' How"
often have I heard this from a Burman's lips! How often have I seen him
irritable and oil is preferable to aloes. Don’t use during pregnancy;
"may cause abortion. For young foals or other animals, the gentler"
"purgative, such as linseed or castor oil should be used. The medical"
"value of aloes being large, it is impossible to enumerate all the"
diseases in which it is useful. Externally the tincture of aloes and
"myrrh is sometimes applied as a stimulant to wounds, and powdered aloes"
is mixed with plaster of paris in making splints for dogs to prevent
these animals from biting and tearing them off. Internally aloes should
"be combined with ginger, nux vomica and given in capsule or bolus."
ALUMEN--ALUM
"DERIVATION.--From alum slate, shale, schist, a native mixture of"
aluminum silicate and iron sulphide. This is roasted and exposed to the
"air, when the sulphur is oxidized into sulphuric acid and combined in"
part with aluminum and iron to form sulphates. The mass is lixiviated
"with water, and aluminum and iron sulphates together with sulphuric acid"
are recovered in solution. The solution is concentrated and to it is
added potassium chloride. The double sulphate of potassium and aluminum
"(alum) is formed, which crystallizes out on cooling, while potassium"
sulphate and ferric chloride remain as by-products. Alum is purified by
recrystallization.
"PROPERTIES.--Large, colorless, octahedral crystals, sometimes modified"
"by cubes or crystalline fragments; without odor, but having a sweetish"
and strongly astringent taste. On exposure to the air the crystals are
liable to absorb ammonia and acquire a whitish coating. Soluble in nine
"parts of water, insoluble in alcohol."
deeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly
decreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these
disturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his
brother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of
priests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the
"townsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of"
"the Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by"
their own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.
"Then again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as"
"one of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties."
Bastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official
"capital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the"
"champions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The"
"schism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which"
"ill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became"
apparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and
masterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.
The first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep
interest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless
came there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which
"can stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially"
when the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of
trenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of
the interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After
Paoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French
"at Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, ""The"
"result of these dispositions was what was inevitable."" [13]"
"For the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely"
"concerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the"
"the story of the great Hermits who, having listened to the discussion"
of the Monday sitting at the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France)
as to the best way to teach the young how to shoot in the direction
"of mathematical genius, said: “_Cultivez l'imagination, messieurs."
"Tout est là. Si vous voulez des mathématiciens, donnez à vos enfants à"
lire--des Contes de Fées._”
Another important effect of the story is to develop at an early
age sympathy for children of other countries where conditions are
different from our own. There is a book used in American schools
"called “Little Citizens of other Lands,” dealing with the clothes,"
the games and occupations of those little citizens. Stories of this
kind are particularly necessary to prevent the development of insular
"notions, and are a check on that robust form of Philistinism, only"
"too prevalent, alas! among grown-ups, which looks askance at new"
suggestions and makes the withering remark: “How un-English! How
"queer!”--the second comment being, it would seem, a natural corollary"
to the first.[40]
I have so constantly to deal with the question of confusion between
Truth and Fiction in the mind of children that it might be useful
to offer here an example of the way they make the distinction for
themselves.
Mrs. Ewing says on this subject:
“If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of
"distinguishing between Fancy and Falsehood, it is most desirable to"
"develop in them the power to do so, but, as a rule, in childhood,"
we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which as elders our
care-clogged memories fail to recall.”
"who, of his own accord, does better things than human laws require? What"
arrogance it is to bind by institutions a man who is clearly led by the
inspirations of the divine spirit!
In Erasmus we already find the beginning of that optimism which judges
"upright man good enough to dispense with fixed forms and rules. As More,"
"in _Utopia_, and Rabelais, Erasmus relies already on the dictates of"
"nature, which produces man as inclined to good and which we may follow,"
provided we are imbued with faith and piety.
In this line of confidence in what is natural and desire of the simple
"and reasonable, Erasmus's educational and social ideas lie. Here he is"
far ahead of his times. It would be an attractive undertaking to discuss
Erasmus's educational ideals more fully. They foreshadow exactly those
"of the eighteenth century. The child should learn in playing, by means"
"of things that are agreeable to its mind, from pictures. Its faults"
should be gently corrected. The flogging and abusive schoolmaster is
Erasmus's abomination; the office itself is holy and venerable to him.
Education should begin from the moment of birth. Probably Erasmus
"attached too much value to classicism, here as elsewhere: his friend"
Peter Gilles should implant the rudiments of the ancient languages in
"his two-year-old son, that he may greet his father with endearing"
stammerings in Greek and Latin. But what gentleness and clear good sense
shines from all Erasmus says about instruction and education!
The same holds good of his views about marriage and woman. In the
problem of sexual relations he distinctly sides with the woman from deep
conviction. There is a great deal of tenderness and delicate feeling in
his conception of the position of the girl and the woman. Few characters
of the _Colloquies_ have been drawn with so much sympathy as the girl

abbot. Erasmus's ideal of marriage is truly social and hygienic. Let us
"anchor and then hoists it up, one recoils from the black and slimy mud"
"those blue waves hide; and this circumstance, slight as it may seem,"
held a potent influence on our future.
"Riding nearby was another yacht, in size and design very much like the"
"_Whim_, except that her rigging had an old-fashioned cut. Her masts were"
"checked with age and, where our craft showed polished brass, she long"
"ago had resorted to white paint. At the same time, she gave the"
"impression of aristocracy--broken-down aristocracy, if you choose. No"
"bunting fluttered at her masthead, no country's emblem waved over her"
"taffrail, and the only hint of nationality or ownership was a rather"
"badly painted word _Orchid_ on her name plate. Taken altogether, she was"
rather difficult to place.
"These signs of poverty would have passed unobserved by us, had we not in"
coming to anchor swung between her moorings and the Machina wharf. Not
"that it made any serious difference, Gates explained, nor were we"
"impertinently near, but it just missed being the scrupulously polite"
thing to have done--and Gates was a stickler on matters of yacht
"etiquette. So he felt uncomfortable about it, while at the same time"
being reluctant to hoist anchor and foul our decks with the bottom of
Havana Bay. To be on the safe side he determined to megaphone apologies
"and consult her wishes. Twice he hailed, receiving no answer. Two"
sailors were seated forward playing cards--a surlier pair of ruffians
would have been hard to find--but neither of them so much as glanced up.
"""Let the professor try in Spanish,"" Tommy said."
"Monsieur took the megaphone and did so, but with no better success. Then"
to our profound admiration he called in half a dozen languages; finally
"growling: ""Lascars, likely!""--and proceeded to hail in something he"
afterwards explained was Lascar gibberish. All of which failed to
to such a futile little house; he could have smashed in the former with
"a blow of his fist, and he could have jumped into the latter through the"
first-floor windows. With his great bulk he felt himself absurdly out
of scale. The tragedy looming huge in his mind was also absurdly out
of scale with his errand. The house was one of a row of twenty
"perky, gabled, two-storied little villas, each coyly shrinking to"
"the farthermost limit of its tiny front garden, and each guarding the"
"privacy of its interior by means of muslin curtains at the windows, tied"
"back by ribbons, the resultant triangle of transparency being obscured"
by a fat-leafed plant. The terrace bore the name of “Tregarthion
"Villas,” and the one inhabited by Miss Lindon was called “The Oaks.” It"
was a sham little terrace full of sham little gentilities. John hated
it. What could have induced his mother's sister to inhabit such a sphere
of flimsiness?
"Flimsiness, also, met him inside, when he was shown through a"
bamboo-furnished passage into a gimcrack little drawing-room. He tried
"several chairs dubiously with his hand, shook his head, and seated"
himself on a couch. Everything in the room seemed flimsy and futile.
He had the impression that everything save a sham spinning-wheel and a
half-solved jig-saw puzzle on the little table was draped in muslin and
"tied up with pink ribbons. A decrepit black-and-tan terrier, disturbed"
"in his slumbers in front of the fire, barked violently. A canary in a"
cage by the window sang in discordant emulation. John poised his hat and
"stick on the curved and slippery satin-covered couch, and they fell with"
a clatter to the floor. The frown deepened on his brow. Why had he come
to this distracting abode of mindlessness? He wished he had brought
Herold gyved and manacled. What with the dog and the canary and the
"doll's-house furniture, the sensitive and fastidious one would have gone"
mad. He would have gloated over his ravings. It would have served him
right.
Competent proofreaders in the best offices frequently call the
"attention of the author to errors in dates, figures, or proper names,"
but this should always be regarded by the author as a courtesy
rather than as something which the printer is expected to do. The
"proofreader, on the other hand, is supposed to have corrected every"
"typographical error, and for the author to mark corrections which have"
been overlooked is a courtesy on the part of the author. The fact that
the author or editor has passed over typographical errors in no way
relieves the proofreader of his responsibility.
The proofreader is expected to correct any obvious error without
"hesitation, but to make no other changes. If he thinks a change should"
"be made, it will take the form of a query in the margin to the author."
"The author should carefully note all such queries, and answer them"
"or strike them out, bearing in mind that if he accepts the query the"
"change necessitated in the type becomes an author's correction, the"
expense of which falls upon the publisher.
Any marks on the proofs for correction should be made distinct by
"drawing a short line through the letter to be changed, etc., placing in"
"the margin the recognized sign indicating the change, _exactly opposite"
"the line in which the change is to be made, and in the order in which"
the necessary alterations occur_. In doing this be sure to write
"legibly, and do not cover the proof with lines and counter-lines."
The author should familiarize himself with the standard proofreading
"marks, and employ these in marking all corrections upon the proofs"
which are sent him. These marks are as follows:

"coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ""But"
"a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was"
"honest,"" said the boy. ""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as"
"angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the"
"water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if"
"the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and"
"charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed"
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and
"will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you"
"any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far"
and near looking for service. But wherever he went people found him too
"small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. At last"
"he came to a merchant. There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and"
he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. When he had been there for
"some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked"
all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them.
"After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little"
fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. He handed him his
"four-shilling piece. ""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the"
"merchant. ""It will not be a large purchase."" ""Buy whatever it will"
"bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. His master"
"promised to do so, and sailed away."
Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had
"reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to"
"his ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did he remember"
"that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to"
"buy him something. ""Must I go up to the city again because of this"
four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with
"such truck,"" thought the merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on"
"tusks. He decided therefore to arrange an uvalaku expedition, at the"
beginning of which the pig was to be killed and feasted upon and its
tusks turned into ornaments.
"When, in November, 1917, I passed through the district, the preparing"
"of the canoes was already afoot. All of those, which still could be"
"repaired, had been taken to pieces and were being relashed, recaulked"
"and repainted. In some hamlets, new dug-outs were being scooped. After"
"a few months stay in the Trobriands, I went South again in March, 1918,"
intending to spend some time in the Amphletts. Landing there is always
"difficult, as there are no anchorages near the shore, and it is quite"
impossible to disembark in rough weather at night. I arrived late in a
"small cutter, and had to cruise between Gumasila and Domdom, intending"
to wait till daybreak and then effect a landing. In the middle of
"the night, however, a violent north-westerly squall came down, and"
"making a split in the main-sail, forced us to run before the wind,"
southwards towards Dobu. It was on this night that the native boys
"employed in the boat, saw the mulukwausi flaming up at the head of"
"the mast. The wind dropped before daybreak, and we entered the Lagoon"
"of Sanaroa, in order to repair the sail. During the three days we"
"stopped there, I roamed over the country, climbing its volcanic cones,"
paddling up the creeks and visiting the villages scattered on the
coral plain. Everywhere I saw signs of the approaching departure for
"Boyowa; the natives preparing their canoes on the beach to be loaded,"
collecting food in the gardens and making sago in the jungle. At the
"head of one of the creeks, in the midst of a sago swamp, there was a"
"long, low shelter which serves as a dwelling to Dobuan natives from"
the main Island when they come to gather sago. This swamp was said
to be reserved to a certain community of Tu'utauna.
"Another day I came upon a party of local natives from Sanaroa, who"
"were pounding sago pulp out of a palm, and sluicing it with water. A"
"London, with its subdued lights, lay all around me. It had not changed"
"since I saw it last, and yet I felt it ought to have changed. The reason"
was that I had changed. And then I began to fear that I had changed
beyond the power of recovery. The oppressive sensation that I was in a
dream forced itself upon me. I felt that there was only one reality in
the whole world--the war. Would I ever escape from the war? It would
"come to an end some day, and I would leave the army, but would not the"
war obsess me until the end of my life? Would I ever be myself again?
But this was not the way to enjoy my leave! I began to feel
disappointed at not being so happy as I had expected to be. Why was I
not full of rapture? Why did not every object fill me with delight? But
I ought to have known that habitual discontent and bitterness and revolt
"are not shaken off in a few hours or a few days, and that they persist"
even after their immediate cause has been removed.
I looked round at the other people sitting on the 'bus. I had visited
"foreign countries in former years, but never before had I felt that I"
"was amongst complete strangers. There are moments when a dog, a horse,"
or a bird fills us with a sense of the uncanny--its mind is an insoluble
"mystery, with depths so dark and inscrutable that one feels something"
that approaches fear and horror. And so it was as I sat on the 'bus. The
civilians around me seemed like animals of a different species. They
were not human at all--or was it I who was not human?
I went to another seat in order to listen to a man and woman who were
"talking together. I felt that if they were to talk about the war, the"
"uncanny spell would be broken, the dream would dissolve and I would be"
restored to my own fellow creatures. But they spoke about trivial
domestic matters and about a flower show. If they had only mentioned the
"word ""war"" I would have felt relieved by its familiarity, but they did"
not mention it once.
scientist to-day would say of the Resurrection of Jesus on which
"ultimately depends His claims to our adoration, “_That could not"
happen_.” We know enough now of the laws of the Universe to know that
we do not know them all.
So some of us perceive that what is needed to-day is to arrest the
"attention of the man in the street, to get him to perceive that"
"Christianity has much more to say for itself than he suspected, and"
that Christian Philosophy will place in his hand a clue which will
guide him in the labyrinth of life.
“I say the acknowledgment of God in Christ
"Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee"
All questions in the earth and out of it.”
We must set men free from phrases and get them to think. It suits the
game of the party politician to pretend that ethics are easily
"self-evident, and that there is a simple fundamental religion on which"
all men are agreed; but there is a question which must be insistently
"urged, and upon the answer to which all things depend, “What think ye"
of Christ?”
Probably nothing has done more to alienate the man in the street from
religious observance than the hypocritical pretence that all men are
agreed about “simple Bible teaching.” He knows well enough that what
really matters is whether a man believes or not that God became man.
If ever the Labour Party should definitely declare for elementary
education without religious teaching it will be because the men whose
children attend the elementary schools know that they cannot read the
"New Testament without asking, “Is it true?”"
“Did Jesus Christ really die and rise again the third day according to
fish or looking for iguanas and crabs hidden in the holes of the banks.
"“Physically the Chocoes are a fine and healthy race. They are tall, as"
"compared with the Cuna-Cuna, well proportioned, and with a graceful"
bearing. The men have wiry limbs and faces that are at once kind and
"energetic, while as a rule the girls are plump, fat, and full of"
mischief. The grown women preserve their good looks and attractiveness
"much longer than is generally the case in primitive peoples, in which"
their sex bears the heaviest share of every day’s work.
"“Both males and females have unusually fine white teeth, which they"
sometimes dye black by chewing the shoots of one of the numerous wild
peppers growing in the forests. The skin is of a rich olive-brown color
"and, as usual, a little lighter in women and children. Though all go"
"almost naked, they look fairer than the San Blas Cunas, and some of the"
women would compare advantageously in this respect with certain
Mediterranean types of the white race.
"“The hair is left by all to grow to its natural length, except in a few"
"cases, in which the men have it cropped at the neck. It is coarse and"
"not jet black, as reported of most Indians, but with a reddish hue,"
which is better noticed when the sun is playing through the thick mass.
"“In young children it decidedly turns at times to a blond color, the"
only difference from the Caucasian hair being the pronounced coarseness
of the former. As there are no white people living within a radius of
"fifty miles, but only negroes, mulattoes and zambos, this peculiarity"
"cannot be explained by miscegenation, and may therefore be considered as"
a racial feature of the Choco tribe.
"“In men the every-day dress consists of a scanty clout, made of a strip"

about several affairs. No one was hurt. There was much braying of asses.
"The Lord Montagu Askew, dainty, foppish, in the mode, and the"
"Honourable Rupert Greppel, hidalgic, head in air, stood before a shop"
window in the Rue de la Paix and gazed at their splendid reflections;
whilst past them moved on the pavement or whirled by in barouches
"the great world of Paris--_hig-lif_ sunning its butterfly wings,"
"honey-questing, sipping at any dew that the gods left lying abroad."
"Montagu Askew held his jade-handled cane mincingly, and he glowed with"
"a gentleman-like glow, for his dove-coloured little book of poems"
tinted all the bookstalls.
More than one woman of high rank this morning had stopped her carriage
to congratulate him on the exquisite lyric wherein the vast firmament
"at break of dawn was likened to the grey of a woman’s glove--indeed, it"
became the vogue of the drawing-rooms--people sang it.
"As a fact, Montagu Askew was acknowledged lord of chamber music."
"Indeed, in his slender careful verse was no rude hint of the"
full-blooded Rabelaisian love of life; it was innocent of the
suggestion of a large emotion; he played upon the accepted measures and
the well-authenticated rhyme; he startled with no surprises; he sounded
no new note--Montagu never forgot he was a gentleman. Not for him the
uncouthness to fling open loud-clanging gates to a new world. He was
"pretty and serenely mannered before everything, disdainful of them that"
"skipped a foot to the hot jigging blood, or such as showed a strong"
disdain; nor was he wanting in contempt for the natural emotions.
"When he condescended to so low an act as to seek nature, he walked"
"through the well-groomed spaces of the world, well-trimmed parks at the"
I suppose that he pads them out with little rubber insets. He alters
"his voice, and his figure, and even his height. He can be stiff and"
"upright like a drilled soldier, or loose-jointed and shambling like a"
"tramp. He is a finished artist, and employs the very simplest means."
"He could, I truly believe, deceive his wife or his mother, but he will"
never again deceive me. I am not a specially observant man; still one
"can make a shot at most things when driven to it, and I object to"
"being the subject of Dawson's ribaldry. If you will take my tip, you"
"will be able to spot him as readily as I do now."""
"""Good. I should love to score off Dawson. He is an aggravating beast."""
"""Study his ears,"" said I. ""He cannot alter their chief characters. The"
"lobes of his ears are not loose, like yours or mine or those of most"
men and women; his are attached to the back of his cheekbones. My
"mother had lobes like those, so had the real Roger Tichborne; I"
noticed Dawson's at once. Also at the top fold of his ears he has
"rather a pronounced blob of flesh. This blob, more prominent in some"
"men than in others, is, I believe, a surviving relic of the sharp"
point which adorned the ears of our animal ancestors. Dawson's
ancestor must have been a wolf or a bloodhound. Whenever now I have a
"strange caller who is not far too tall or far too short to be Dawson,"
"if a stranger stops me in the street to ask for a direction, if a"
"porter at a station dashes up to help me with my bag, I go for his"
ears. If the lobes are attached to the cheekbones and there is a
"pronounced blob in the fold at the top, I address the man instantly as"
"Dawson, however impossibly unlike Dawson he may be. I have spotted him"
"twice now since he bowled me out, and he is frightfully savage--especially"
as I won't tell him how the trick is done. He says that it is my duty to
"tell him, and that he will compel me under some of his beloved Defence of"
the Realm Regulations. But the rack could not force me to give away my
"precious secret. Cherish it and use it. You will not tell, for you love"
"for derision from all the “chorus of irresponsible reviewers, the"
irresponsible indolent reviewers.”
I believe that Fiction will find those that can be reached by no other
means. Fiction sometimes sets a man seeking for Fact.
Very diffidently and very reverently I may remind my contemporaries
"that one, who has, at any rate, profoundly influenced the course of"
"history, whatever view we may take of His person, did not disdain this"
"method, “He taught them by parables.”"
“Let me tell you a story.” Is there any age of mankind which does not
respond to the invitation and give audience? A story stilled the
"tumult of the nursery in our earliest days, when heavy storms shook"
"the windows and the tedium of a long, wet afternoon had turned play"
into fretfulness. A story beguiled us into interest when our History
"lesson had seemed an arid futility in Fourth Form days, and our"
magisterial enemies began to show themselves human after all when they
bade us read _The Last of the Barons_ as we were painfully plodding in
"the Plantagenet period, and found the War of the Roses a very thorny"
waste.
It is strange to turn over the pages of eminent evangelical sermons
of the early Victorian days and to notice how “Novel reading” is
denounced. Probably the worthy divines who fulminated against fiction
"were thinking of their own boyhood, and the mischief which came to"
them from Fielding and Richardson and Smollett surreptitiously
perused. Sir Anthony Absolute’s detestation of the circulating library
survived in some provincial circles even when Sir Walter Scott had
come to his own. The last forty years have altered things
"considerably, and though some men may pretend to despise novels,"
now-a-days they must take them into account. Wise and learned persons
"formations of the stratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to"
"each formation its maximum thickness wherever found, amounts to"
not less than forty miles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate
"upon the sea floor, we must believe that the successive cycles"
which the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost
"inconceivably remote, and measure tens of millions and perhaps"
even hundreds of millions of years.
HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE
"UP. Arranged in the order of their succession, the formations of"
the earth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the
"geological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known"
as the GEOLOGICAL RECORD. But to arrange the formations in their
natural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes
of the record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and
chapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one
"area certain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many"
"missing leaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these"
absent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search
through many other regions.
Adjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF
"SUPERPOSITION, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it"
"was deposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid"
later than that on which it rests. Where rocks have been
"disturbed, their original attitude must be determined before the"
law can be applied. Nor can the law of superposition be used in
identifying and comparing the strata of different regions where
the formations cannot be traced continuously from one region to
the other.
The formations of different regions are arranged in their true
to be the case.
Grey had a faint misgiving at the first that no manager might be
forthcoming to admit the dialogue to his boards; but there the old actor
knew his ground.  He succeeded in inviting two of the most successful
"managers to listen to a performance in the attic, without the"
accessories which would add much to the effect upon the stage; and even
"so the scene proved so telling, the acting of the Old Lion was so superb"
"in its quiet dignity, and Grey (who had learned and studied patiently"
"and diligently) went through his part with such spirit, such power, such"
"dramatic energy, that even his instructor was surprised at his success,"
and the managers exchanged glances of astonishment and pleasure.
It was just the sort of piece to catch the public favour at this
"juncture.  Marlborough was still the idol of the nation, and might be"
expected home some time before the winter closed—perhaps before
"Christmas itself.  The nation was discussing how to do him honour, and"
would flock to see a piece wherein his praises were so ably sung.
"""With a wig such as the Duke wears, and with military dress, Mr. Grey"
"could be made to look the very image of the great General,"" cried one."
"""He has something the same class of face—handsome, regular features,"
grace of action and bearing. He does but want to be transformed from
"fair to dark, and his acting of the Duke will bring down veritable"
"thunders of applause from all."""
"And then began a gratifying rivalry as to terms, in which the Old Lion"
sustained his part with dignity and firmness.  Both managers desired to
"secure this interlude for their respective theatres, and at the last it"
was settled that the performance was to be given two nights a week at
"Drury Lane, and two at Sadler’s Wells, the astute old actor retaining"
"Third International, is at the same time reacting most violently away"
"from all other contact, back, recoiling on herself, into a fierce,"
unapproachable Russianism. Which motion will conquer? The workman's
"International, or the centripetal movement into national isolation? Are"
we going to merge into one grey proletarian homogeneity?--or are we
"going to swing back into more-or-less isolated, separate, defiant"
communities?
Probably both. The workman's International movement will finally break
"the flow towards cosmopolitanism and world-assimilation, and suddenly in"
a crash the world will fly back into intense separations. The moment has
"come when America, that extremist in world-assimilation and"
"world-oneness, is reacting into violent egocentricity, a truly"
Amerindian egocentricity. As sure as fate we are on the brink of
American empire.
"For myself, I am glad. I am glad that the era of love and oneness is"
over: hateful homogeneous world-oneness. I am glad that Russia flies
"back into savage Russianism, Scythism, savagely self-pivoting. I am glad"
that America is doing the same. I shall be glad when men hate their
"common, world-alike clothes, when they tear them up and clothe"
"themselves fiercely for distinction, savage distinction, savage"
distinction against the rest of the creeping world: when America kicks
"the billy-cock and the collar-and-tie into limbo, and takes to her own"
national costume: when men fiercely react against looking all alike and
"being all alike, and betake themselves into vivid clan or"
nation-distinctions.
The era of love and oneness is over. The era of world-alike should be at
an end. The other tide has set in. Men will set their bonnets at one
"another now, and fight themselves into separation and sharp distinction."
"The day of peace and oneness is over, the day of the great fight into"
"from an atomizer, about one ounce, usually being enough for the painless"
"opening of abscesses or fistulae, but cocaine is better in our patients."
"_As an anesthetic_ it should be used in preference to chloroform, for"
"the smaller and young animals, especially dogs, which are easily killed"
by chloroform. Ether is less prompt in action but much safer than
"chloroform, as it never paralyzes a healthy heart; it should be inhaled"
"in as concentrated a form as possible, very little air being allowed, so"
"it will exert its effects quickly, in the dog; a light or fire of any"
"kind should not be allowed near, as ether is very inflammable and its"
vapor explosive. Always have a bottle of aqua ammonia fort. at hand as a
restorer.
ALCOHOL
"Alcohol is derived directly from fruit sugar, and indirectly from"
"starch. The grains, as wheat, rye, corn; and potatoes, supply starch"
most economically. The starch in these substances is converted into
"glucose by heating with very dilute sulphuric acid, or by fermentation"
with malt. Glucose is further acted upon by yeast containing the Torula
"cerevisiae, which converts 15 per cent of glucose into alcohol and"
carbonic dioxide. The weak alcohol resulting is subjected to repeated
distillation until sufficiently pure and concentrated. In the natural
"fermentation of fruit sugar in grape juice, during the formation of"
"wine, the amount of alcohol is self-limited to 15, rarely 20 per cent,"
since the ferment is killed by a larger amount of alcohol than this.
"DERIVATION.--The official alcohol is derived from rectified spirits, by"
"maceration, first with anhydrous potassium carbonate, then freshly fused"
"acres or even more. All fruit is delivered along the railway lines, and"
"the larger growers have tramways, the cars drawn by oxen or mules, to"
carry their fruit to the stipulated point. Notice is given the growers
"of the date on which the fruit will be called for, and within twelve to"
eighteen hours after it has been cut it is in the hold of the vessel. It
"is subjected to a rigid inspection at the docks, and the flaws for which"
whole bunches are rejected would often be quite undiscernible to the
ordinary observer.
"[Illustration: IN BOUQUETTE VALLEY, THE MOST FERTILE PART OF CHIRIQUI]"
"The banana is one of the few fruits which are free from insect pests,"
"being protected by its thick, bitter skin. If allowed to ripen in the"
"open, however, it speedily falls a prey to a multitude of egg-laying"
"insects. The tree itself is not so immune. Lately a small rodent,"
"something like the gopher of our American states, has discovered that"
banana roots are good to eat. From time immemorial he lived in the
"jungle, burrowing and nibbling the roots of the plants there, but in an"
unlucky moment for the fruit companies he discovered that tunneling in
soil that had been worked was easier and the roots of the cultivated
banana more succulent than his normal diet. Therefore a large
importation of scientists from Europe and the United States to find some
way of eradicating the industrious pest that has attacked the chief
"industry of the tropics at the root, so to speak."
[Illustration: COFFEE PLANT AT BOUQUETTE]
Baron Humboldt is said to have first called the attention of civilized
"people to the food value of the banana, but it was one of the founders"
"of the United Fruit Company, a New England sea captain trading to Colon,"
who first introduced it to the general market in the United States. For
a time he carried home a few bunches in the cabin of his schooner for
I shall not say whence the document emanated. I believe it was composed
"by some one who does not lack a certain knowledge of Japan, but who has"
drawn false deductions from his knowledge of similar matters of other
countries. Here is the best example. The document speaks of the native
contingents of Formosa. Now there exist no such forces in Formosa. The
"garrisons of Formosa are sent there from Japan. On the other hand, in"
the colonies belonging to other countries there are generally troops
formed of native contingents. It is notably so in French colonies. The
"author of the document in question, reasoning from these facts, thought"
that it ought to be the same with Formosa.
Has Japan any fear of another alteration of the Treaty of
Shimonoseki being imposed upon her?
"The combined action of Russia, Germany and France, for imposing on"
Japan an alteration of the Treaty of Shimonoseki appears to us to have
been a great error on their parts. I can positively say that there are
many eminent persons in Germany and in France who regret that action.
"Even in Russia, in certain quarters, a belief seems to be entertained"
"that, but for the fault then committed, the present misfortunes would"
"not have happened. As to ourselves, we are not hypnotised by the errors"
then committed by those three powers. We intend to remain friends of
"France, of Germany, and even of Russia, in spite of the injustice we"
"have suffered, provided, of course, those powers wish to keep"
friendship.
We do not overlook the possibility of another combination which those
"powers may have an idea of forming against us, and it behoves us to be"
"watchful. Nevertheless, to tell you my candid opinion, it is scarcely"
possible that a similar intervention should be renewed. I do not think
France would push her docility so far as to follow Germany a second
"time. It would be necessary that Germany should set the example, aided"
"Scott writes of him: 'Honest old Mr. Ferrier is dead, at extreme old"
age. I confess I should not like to live so long. He was a man with
"strong passions and strong prejudices, but with generous and manly"
"sentiments at the same time.' James Ferrier's wife, Miss Coutts, was"
"remarkable for her beauty: a large family was born to her, the eldest"
"son of whom was James Frederick Ferrier's father. Young Ferrier, the"
"subject of this sketch, used frequently to dine with his grandfather at"
"his house in Morningside, where Susan Ferrier acted in the capacity of"
hostess; and it is easy to imagine the bright talk which would take
"place on these occasions, and the impression which must have been made"
"upon the lad, both then and after he attained to manhood; for Miss"
"Ferrier survived until 1854. In later life, indeed, her wit was said to"
"be somewhat caustic, and she was possibly dreaded by her younger"
"friends and relatives as much as she was respected; but this, to do her"
"justice, was partly owing to infirmities. She was at anyrate keenly"
"interested in the fortunes of her nephew, to whom she was in the habit"
"of alluding as 'the last of the metaphysicians'--scarcely, perhaps, a"
"very happy title for one who was somewhat of an iconoclast, and began a"
new era rather than concluded an old.
"[1] In a _Life of Susan Ferrier_, lately published, an"
account of the family is given which was written by Miss
"Ferrier, for her nephew, the subject of our memoir."
"James Frederick Ferrier's mother, Margaret Wilson, was a sister of"
"Professor John Wilson--the 'Christopher North' of immortal memory,"
whose daughter he was afterwards to marry. Margaret Ferrier was a woman
of striking personal beauty. Her features were perfect in their
"symmetry, as is shown in a lovely miniature, painted by Saunders, a"
"well-known miniature painter of the day, now in the possession of"
"Professor Ferrier's son, her grandson. Many of these personal charms"
"descended to James Ferrier, whose well-cut features bore considerable"
CHAPTER XXX.
ROMAN CATHOLIC RELICS AT ROME.
"We reached Rome at a good time for seeing relics, as the special"
services of the Christmas season were just beginning. One of the most
splendid of these ceremonies is the procession in honor of the _Santa
"Culla_; that is, the cradle in which the priestly tradition says the"
infant Jesus was carried into Egypt. This is the great relic and chief
"distinction of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, though it contains"
"a number of others, such as the bodies of St. Matthew and St. Jerome,"
"and two little bags of the brains of Thomas á Becket, and ""one of the"
pictures attributed to St. Luke (and announced to be such in a papal
"bull attached to the walls!), much revered for the belief that it"
stayed the plague which decimated the city during the reign of Pelagius
"II., and that (after its intercession had been sought by a procession"
by order of Innocent VIII.) it brought about the overthrow of the
"Moorish dominion in Spain."""
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Snow in Summertime.]
"Moreover, this church of Santa Maria Maggiore is by no means lacking"
"in legendary and architectural interest. It was founded A. D. 352, by"
"Pope Liberius and John, a Roman patrician, to commemorate an alleged"
"miraculous fall of snow, which covered this spot of ground and no"
"other, on the 5th of August, and an alleged appearance of the Virgin"
"Mary, in a vision, at the same time, showing them that she had thus"
"appropriated the site of a new temple, all of which is duly represented"
"in a fine painting on the wall of the church, and in two of Murillo's"
"most beautiful pictures in the Academy at Madrid, and commemorated"
"every year on the 5th of August by a solemn high mass, and by showers"
forms.
THE GREAT LENGTH OF GEOLOGIC TIME INFERRED FROM THE SLOW CHANGE OF
"SPECIES. Life forms, like land forms, are thus subject to change"
under the influence of their changing environment and of forces
acting from within. How slowly they change may be seen in the
apparent stability of existing species. In the lifetime of the
"observer and even in the recorded history of man, species seem as"
stable as the mountain and the river. But life forms and land
"forms are alike variable, both in nature and still more under the"
shaping hand of man. As man has modified the face of the earth
"with his great engineering works, so he has produced widely"
different varieties of many kinds of domesticated plants and
"animals, such as the varieties of the dog and the horse, the apple"
"and the rose, which may be regarded in some respects as new"
species in the making. We have assumed that land forms have
changed in the past under the influence of forces now in
operation. Assuming also that life forms have always changed as
"they are changing at present, we come to realize something of the"
immensity of geologic time required for the evolution of life from
its earliest lowly forms up to man.
It is because the onward march of life has taken the same general
course the world over that we are able to use it as a UNIVERSAL
TIME SCALE and divide geologic time into ages and minor
subdivisions according to the ruling or characteristic organisms
"then living on the earth. Thus, since vertebrates appeared, we"
"have in succession the Age of Fishes, the Age of Amphibians, the"
"Age of Reptiles, and the Age of Mammals."
The chart given on page 295 is thus based on the law of
superposition and the law of the evolution of organisms. The first
It must have been somewhat painful for Erasmus that his friend had so
"far surpassed him in power and position, and was now called to bring by"
diplomatic means the solution which he himself would have liked to see
"achieved by ideal harmony, good will and toleration. He had never"
"trusted Aleander, and was more than ever on his guard against him. As a"
"humanist, in spite of brilliant gifts, Aleander was by far Erasmus's"
"inferior, and had never, like him, risen from literature to serious"
theological studies; he had simply prospered in the service of Church
magnates (whom Erasmus had given up early). This man was now invested
with the highest mediating powers.
To what degree of exasperation Erasmus's most violent antagonists at
Louvain had now been reduced is seen from the witty and slightly
malicious account he gives Thomas More of his meeting with Egmondanus
"before the Rector of the university, who wanted to reconcile them. Still"
"things did not look so black as Ulrich von Hutten thought, when he wrote"
"to Erasmus: 'Do you think that you are still safe, now that Luther's"
"books are burned? Fly, and save yourself for us!'"
Ever more emphatic do Erasmus's protestations become that he has nothing
to do with Luther. Long ago he had already requested him not to mention
"his name, and Luther promised it: 'Very well, then, I shall not again"
"refer to you, neither will other good friends, since it troubles you'."
"Ever louder, too, are Erasmus's complaints about the raving of the monks"
"at him, and his demands that the mendicant orders be deprived of the"
right to preach.
In April 1521 comes the moment in the world's history to which
"Christendom has been looking forward: Luther at the Diet of Worms,"
"holding fast to his opinions, confronted by the highest authority in the"
Empire. So great is the rejoicing in Germany that for a moment it may
living creatures is all his own. And here I may mention a very curious
"contrast, that whereas in India the Hindu will not take life and the"
"Mussulman will, yet the Mussulman is by reputation far kinder to his"
beasts than the Hindu. Here the Burman combines both qualities. He has
"all the kindness to animals that the Mahommedan has, and more, and he"
has the same horror of taking life that the Hindu has.
"Coming from half-starved, over-driven India, it is a revelation to see"
the animals in Burma. The village ponies and cattle and dogs in India
"are enough to make the heart bleed for their sordid misery, but in Burma"
"they are a delight to the eye. They are all fat, every one of them--fat"
and comfortable and impertinent; even the ownerless dogs are well fed. I
suppose the indifference of the ordinary native of India to animal
"suffering comes from the evil of his own lot. He is so very poor, he has"
"such hard work to find enough for himself and his children, that his"
sympathy is all used up. He has none to spare. He is driven into a dumb
"heartlessness, for I do not think he is actually cruel."
The Burman is full of the greatest sympathy towards animals of all
"kinds, of the greatest understanding of their ways, of the most"
humorously good-natured attitude towards them. Looking at them from his
"manhood, he has no contempt for them; but the gentle toleration of a"
"father to very little children who are stupid and troublesome often, but"
are very lovable. He feels himself so far above them that he can
"condescend towards them, and forbear with them."
His ponies are pictures of fatness and impertinence and go. They never
have any vice because the Burman is never cruel to them; they are never
"well trained, partly because he does not know how to train them, partly"
because they are so near the aboriginal wild pony as to be incapable of
"very much training. But they are willing; they will go for ever, and"
"are very strong, and they have admirable constitutions and tempers. You"
was regarded by the Germans.
It was in 1837 that Ferrier married the young lady with whom he had so
long corresponded. The marriage was in all respects a happy one. Mrs.
"Ferrier's gifts and graces, inherited from her father, will not soon be"
"forgotten, either in St. Andrews where she lived so long, or in"
"Edinburgh, the later home of her widowhood. One whose spirits were less"
gay might have found a husband whose interests were so completely in
his work--and that a work in which she could not share--difficult to
"deal with; but she possessed understanding to appreciate that work, as"
"well as humour, and could accommodate herself to the circumstances in"
"which she found herself; while he, on his part, entered into the gaiety"
on occasion with the best. A friend and student of the St. Andrews'
"days writes of Ferrier: 'He married his cousin Margaret, Professor's"
"Wilson's daughter, and I don't doubt that a shorthand report of their"
courtship would have been better worth reading than nine hundred and
"ninety-nine out of every thousand courtships, for she had wit as well"
"as beauty, and he was capable of appreciating both. No more charming"
"woman have I ever seen or heard making game of mankind in general, and"
in particular of pedants and hypocrites. She would even laugh at her
"husband on occasion, but it was dangerous for any volunteer to try to"
help her in that sport. A finer-looking couple I have never seen.[5]
"[5] Another sister married William Edmondstoune Aytoun, the"
poet. It was regarding Professor Aytoun's proposal for Miss
Wilson's hand that the following story is told. When the
"engagement was being formed, Aytoun somewhat demurred to"
"interviewing the father of the lady, and she herself"
undertook the mission. Presently she returned with a card
"pinned upon her breast bearing the satisfactory inscription,"
"'With the author's compliments'! Aytoun, as is well known,"
"was extremely plain, and it was of his bust in the"
"infant mind with the stories of his bold adventures, the numerous fights"
"in which he had taken part, the death of his companions and his"
hair-breadth escapes. Numerous were the decorations he bore. The most
conspicuous was an ugly mark on his breast left by an arrow and a hole
on the thigh caused by a spear thrust. The trust imposed on this
marauder proved to be not altogether ill placed for once in a river
journey we were pursued by several long boats filled with armed dacoits.
When these boats came too near for us to effect an escape the erstwhile
"dacoit leader, my attendant, stood up and gave a peculiar cry, which was"
evidently understood. For the pursuing boats vanished at the signal.
INDUSTRIAL EFFORTS
"I come now to another period of his life fifty years from now, when he"
foresaw the economic danger that threatened his country. This
Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was one of the first means he
thought of to avert the threatened danger. Here also he attempted to
bring together other activities. Evening entertainments were given by
"the performances of ""Jatras,"" which have been the expression of our"
national drama and which have constantly enriched our Bengali literature
by the contributions of village bards and composers. There were athletic
tournaments also and display of physical strength and endurance. He also
"established here the people's Bank, which is now in a most flourishing"
"condition. He established industrial and technical schools, and it was"
there that the inventive bend of my mind received its first impetus. I
remember the deep impression made on my mind by the form of worship
rendered by the artisans to Viswakarma God in his aspect as the Great
Artificer: His hand it was that was moulding the whole creation; and it
"seemed that we were the instruments in his hand, through whom he"
intended to fashion some Great Design.
necessary. In this matter the aims of the people and the Government are
one. In facing a common danger and in co-operation there must arise
mutual respect and understanding. And perhaps through the very
catastrophe that is threatening the world there may grow up in India a
realisation of community of interest and solidarity as between
Government and people.
A CALL FOR NOBLER PATRIOTISM
A very serious danger is thus seen to be threatening the future of
"India, and to avert it will require the utmost effort of the people."
They have not only to meet the economic crisis but also to protect the
ideals of ancient Aryan civilisation from the destructive forces that
are threatening it. Nothing great can be conserved except through
"constant effort and sacrifice. There is a danger of, regarding the"
mechanical efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the
"opposite danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and activity,"
degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only through the
nobler call of patriotism can our nation realise her highest ideals in
thought and in action; to that call the nation will always respond. He
had the inestimable privilege of winning the intimate friendship of Mr.
"G. K. Gokhale. Before leaving England, our foremost Indian statesman"
"whose loss we so deeply mourn, had come to stay with the speaker for a"
few days at Eastbourne. He knew that this was to be their last meeting.
Almost his parting question to Dr. Bose was whether science had anything
"to say about future incarnations. For himself, however he was certain"
that as soon as he would cast off his worn out frame he was to be born
"once more in the country he loved, and bear all the country that may be"
laid on him in her service. There can be no doubt that there must be
salvation for a country which can count on sons as devoted as Gopal
Krishna Gokhale.
The best proof that Erasmus had practically given up his hope to play a
conciliatory part may be found in what follows. In the summer of 1520
"the famous meeting between the three monarchs, Henry VIII, Francis I and"
"Charles V, took place at Calais. Erasmus was to go there in the train of"
his prince. How would such a congress of princes--where in peaceful
"conclave the interests of France, England, Spain, the German Empire, and"
"a considerable part of Italy, were represented together--have affected"
"Erasmus's imagination, if his ideal had remained unshaken! But there are"
"no traces of this. Erasmus was at Calais in July 1520, had some"
"conversation with Henry VIII there, and greeted More, but it does not"
appear that he attached any other importance to the journey than that of
"an opportunity, for the last time, to greet his English friends."
"It was awkward for Erasmus that just at this time, when the cause of"
"faith took so much harsher forms, his duties as counsellor to the"
"youthful Charles, now back from Spain to be crowned as emperor,"
circumscribed his liberty more than before. In the summer of 1520
"appeared, based on the incriminating material furnished by the Louvain"
"faculty, the papal bull declaring Luther to be a heretic, and, unless he"
"should speedily recant, excommunicating him. 'I fear the worst for the"
"unfortunate Luther,' Erasmus writes, 9 September 1520, 'so does"
"conspiracy rage everywhere, so are princes incensed with him on all"
"sides, and, most of all, Pope Leo. Would Luther had followed my advice"
and abstained from those hostile and seditious actions!... They will not
rest until they have quite subverted the study of languages and the good
learning.... Out of the hatred against these and the stupidity of monks
"did this tragedy first arise.... I do not meddle with it. For the rest,"
a bishopric is waiting for me if I choose to write against Luther.'
"Indeed, Erasmus had become, by virtue of his enormous celebrity, as"
"circumstances would have it, more and more a valuable asset in the great"
"appear at Augsburg, stands before the legate Cajetanus and refuses to"
recant. Seething enthusiasm surrounds him. Just about that time Erasmus
"writes to one of Luther's partisans, John Lang, in very favourable terms"
about his work. The theses have pleased everybody. 'I see that the
"monarchy of the Pope at Rome, as it is now, is a pestilence to"
"Christendom, but I do not know if it is expedient to touch that sore"
"openly. That would be a matter for princes, but I fear that these will"
act in concert with the Pope to secure part of the spoils. I do not
understand what possessed Eck to take up arms against Luther.' The
letter did not find its way into any of the collections.
"The year 1519 brought the struggle attending the election of an emperor,"
"after old Maximilian had died in January, and the attempt of the curia"
to regain ground with lenity. Germany was expecting the long-projected
"disputation between Johannes Eck and Andreas Karlstadt which, in truth,"
"would concern Luther. How could Erasmus, who himself was involved that"
"year in so many polemics, have foreseen that the Leipzig disputation,"
which was to lead Luther to the consequence of rejecting the highest
"ecclesiastical authority, would remain of lasting importance in the"
"history of the world, whereas his quarrel with Lee would be forgotten?"
On 28 March 1519 Luther addressed himself personally to Erasmus for the
"first time. 'I speak with you so often, and you with me, Erasmus, our"
ornament and our hope; and we do not know each other as yet.' He
"rejoices to find that Erasmus displeases many, for this he regards as a"
"sign that God has blessed him. Now that his, Luther's, name begins to"
"get known too, a longer silence between them might be wrongly"
"interpreted. 'Therefore, my Erasmus, amiable man, if you think fit,"
"acknowledge also this little brother in Christ, who really admires you"
"and feels friendly disposed towards you, and for the rest would deserve"
"no better, because of his ignorance, than to lie, unknown, buried in a"
corner.'
THE VOICE OF LIFE
"The following is the Inaugural Address delivered by Sir J. C. Bose, on"
"the 30th November 1917, in dedicating the Bose Institute to the Nation."
I dedicate to-day this Institute--not merely a Laboratory but a Temple.
The power of physical methods applies for the establishment of that
"truth which can be realised directly through our senses, or through the"
vast expansion of the perceptive range by means of artificially created
organs. We still gather the tremulous message when the note of the
"audible reaches the unheard. When human sight fails, we continue to"
explore the region of the invisible. The little that we can see is as
nothing compared to the vastness of that which we cannot. Out of the
very imperfection of his senses man has built himself a raft of thought
by which he makes daring adventures on the great seas of the Unknown.
But there are other truths which will remain beyond even the
"supersensitive methods known to science. For these we require faith,"
tested not in a few years but by an entire life. And a temple is erected
as a fit memorial for the establishment of that truth for which faith
"was needed. The personal, yet general, truth and faith whose"
establishment this Institute commemorates is this: that when one
"dedicates himself wholly for a great object, the closed doors shall"
"open, and the seemingly impossible will become possible for him."
Thirty-two years ago I chose teaching of science as my vocation. It was
"held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would"
always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations.
Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed
"present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there were no"
well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This was all too
"red croton leaves, and the leaves of the red-blossomed mangrove--red"
"coloured substances being used to make the shell red, magically. Then,"
"passing in front of all the other canoes, he rubs their prows with"
"the bundle of leaves. After that, the canoes at both ends of the"
"row begin to punt along, the row evolving into a circle, through"
"which presently the canoe of the magician passes, punting along its"
"diameter. At this place in the Lagoon, there is a small vatu (coral"
outcrop) called Vitukwayla'i. This is called the vatu of the baloma
"(spirits). At this vatu the magician's canoe stops, and he orders some"
of its crew to dive down and here to begin the gathering of shells.
Some more private magic is performed later on by each canoe on its own
"account. The anchor stone is charmed with some red hibiscus flowers,"
in order to make the spondylus shell red. There is another private
"magic called 'sweeping of the sea,' which, like the magic of the mussel"
"shell, mentioned above, makes the sea clear and transparent. Finally,"
there is an evil magic called 'besprinkling with salt water.' If a
"man does it over the others, he will annul the effects of their magic,"
"and frustrate their efforts, while he himself would arouse astonishment"
and suspicion by the amount of shell collected. Such a man would dive
"down into the water, take some brine into his mouth, and emerging,"
"spray it towards the other canoes, while he utters the evil charm."
So much for the magic and the ceremonial associated with the
"spondylus fishing in the Trobriand Lagoon. In Sanaroa, exactly the"
"same proceedings take place, except that there is no attracting of"
"the reef, probably because they are already at the original seat"
of the kaloma. Again I was told that some of the private magic
would be performed in Sinaketa before the fleet sailed on the Kula
"expedition. The objects medicated would be then kept, well wrapped"
in dried leaves.
work on a large scale will be compelled to adopt.
"To my mind the United Fruit Company, next to the Panama Canal, is the"
great phenomenon of the Caribbean world today. Some day some one with
knowledge will write a book about it as men have written the history of
"the British East India Company, or the Worshipful Company of Hudson Bay"
"Adventurers, for this distinctly American enterprise has accomplished a"
creative work so wonderful and so romantic as to entitle it to equal
literary consideration. Its coöperation with the Republic of Panama and
the manner in which it has followed the plans formulated by the Isthmian
Commission entitles it to attention in a book treating of Panama.

This harbor of the chief banana port of Panama would accommodate a navy]
"The banana business is the great trade of the tropics, and one that"
"cannot be reduced in volume by new competition, as cane sugar was"
checked by beet sugar. But it is a business which requires special
machinery of distribution for its success. From the day the banana is
picked until it is in the stomach of the ultimate consumer the time
"should not exceed three weeks. The fruit must be picked green, as, if"
"allowed to ripen on the trees, it splits open and the tropical insects"
"infect it. This same condition, by the way, affects all tropical fruits."
All must be gathered while still unripe. The nearest wholesale market
"for bananas is New Orleans, five days’ steaming. New York is seven days"
away. That means that once landed the fruit must be distributed to
commission houses and agents all over the United States with the utmost
expedition lest it spoil in transit. There can be no holding it in
"storage, cold or otherwise, for a stronger demand or a higher market."
This means that the corporation must deal with agents who can be relied
upon to absorb the cargoes of the ships as regularly as they arrive.
"the blood-stained House. Certain of the nobles, gathered together,"
resolve upon an alliance for the purpose of restoring a strong
"government. The Duke of Albany, however, thinks to snatch power to"
himself from this opportunity. _Scene 2._--Report is made of the
"suppression of the rebellion, but this news is immediately followed by a"
report of Albany's attempted usurpation of the throne. Coalition for his
"defeat is agreed upon, and the play ends with the mournful soliloquy of"
that aged counsellor who first opposed the division of the throne and
"now sees, as the consequence of that fatal act, his country, torn to"
"pieces by civil strife, left an easy prize for an ambitious conqueror."
Hereto it comes when kings will not consent
"To grave advice, but follow wilful will."
"This is the end, when in fond princes' hearts"
"Flattery prevails, and sage rede[51] hath no place:"
"These are the plagues, when murder is the mean"
To make new heirs unto the royal crown....
"And this doth grow, when lo, unto the prince,"
"Whom death or sudden hap of life bereaves,"
"No certain heir remains, such certain heir,"
"As not all only is the rightful heir,"
But to the realm is so made known to be;
"And troth thereby vested in subjects' hearts,"
To owe faith there where right is known to rest.
"This last quotation, interesting in itself as containing a"
"recommendation to Queen Elizabeth to marry, or at least name her"
"successor, will also serve as a specimen of the new verse, Blank Verse,"
"which here, for the first time, finds its way into English drama."
Meeting with small favour from writers skilful in the stringing together
"of rhymes, it suffered comparative neglect for some years until Marlowe"
taught its capacities to his own and future ages. With Sackville's stiff
"intrusions of molten rock, and have been broken, crumpled, and"
"crushed, and left in interlocking masses so confused that their"
true arrangement can usually be made out only with the greatest
difficulty if at all. The condition of this body of crystalline
rocks is due to the fact that they have suffered not only from the
"faultings, foldings, and igneous intrusions of their time, but"
"necessarily, also, from those of all later geological ages."
At present three leading theories are held as to the origin of
these basal crystalline rocks.
1. They are considered by perhaps the majority of the geologists
who have studied them most carefully to be igneous rocks intruded
in a molten state among the sedimentary rocks involved with them.
In many localities this relation is proved by the phenomena of
contact; but for the most part the deformations which the rocks
have since suffered again and again have been sufficient to
destroy such evidence if it ever existed.
2. An older view regards them as profoundly altered sedimentary
"strata, the most ancient of the earth."
3. According to a third theory they represent portions of the
"earth's original crust; not, indeed, its original surface, but"
deeper portions uncovered by erosion and afterwards mantled with
sedimentary deposits. All these theories agree that the present
foliated condition of these rocks is due to the intense
metamorphism which they have suffered.
It is to this body of crystalline rocks and the stratified rocks
"involved with it, which form a very small proportion of its mass,"
"that the term ARCHEAN (Greek, ARCHE, beginning) is applied by many"
the woman of the myth. It begins with a long list of ancestral names;
then follows a boastful picture of how the whole fleet admires the
magical success of the magician's spell. The key-word in the main part
"is the word 'itolo': 'it stands up,' i.e., 'it starts,' and with this,"
"there are enumerated all the various classes of the kaloma shell,"
"differentiated according to size, colour and quality. It ends up with"
"another boast; ""My canoe is overloaded with shell so that it sinks,"""
which is repeated with varying phraseology.
"This spell the magician may utter once only, or he may repeat it"
several times on successive days. He fixes then the final date for the
"fishing expedition. On the evening before that date, the men perform"
"some private magic, every one in his own house. The hammering stone,"
"the gabila, which is always a binabina (it is a stone imported from"
"the Koya), is charmed over. As a rule it is put on a piece of dried"
banana leaf with some red hibiscus blossoms and leaves or flowers
"of red colour. A formula is uttered over it, and the whole is then"
wrapped up in the banana leaf and kept there until it is used. This
"will make the stone a lucky one in hitting off many shells, and it"
will make the shells very red.
Another rite of private magic consists in charming a large mussel
"shell, with which, on the next morning, the body of the canoe will"
"be scraped. This makes the sea clear, so that the diver may easily"
see and frequently find his spondylus shells.
Next morning the whole fleet starts on the expedition. Some food has
"been taken into the canoes, as the fishing usually lasts for a few"
"days, the nights being spent on the beach of Nanoula. When the canoes"
"arrive at a certain point, about half-way between Sinaketa and Nanoula,"
they all range themselves in a row. The canoe of the magician is at the
"right flank, and he medicates a bunch of red hibiscus flowers, some"
"mongrel château. His force was scattered out of sight, though for the"
"most part not out of hearing of each other. It was indeed true that,"
"owing to his excellent dispositions, and the fortunate situation of the"
"balconies, he was able to command every part of the castle enclosure,"
and especially the doors by which it was most likely that the chief
attempt would be made.
"So occupied had Rollo been with his affairs, both private and of a"
"military character, that he had actually wholly forgotten the presence"
"of the Queen-Regent, her daughter and husband, within the palace of La"
Granja. And this though he had come all that way across two of the
wildest provinces of Spain for the sole purpose of securing their
persons and transporting mother and daughter to the camp of Don Carlos.
"Nevertheless so instant was the danger which now overhung every one,"
that their intended captor had ceased to think of anything but how to
preserve these royal lives and to keep them from the hands of the
ruthless gipsies of the hills.
But circumstances quickly recalled the young man to his primary
"purpose, and taught him that he must not trust too much to those whose"
interests were opposed to his own.
"Rollo, as we have said, had reserved no station for himself, but"
"constantly circulated round all the posts of his little army, ready at"
any time to add himself to the effective forces of the garrison at any
threatened point. It was while he was thus passing from balcony to
balcony on the second or defending storey that his quick ear caught the
sound of a door opening and shutting on the floor beneath.
"""Ah,"" thought Rollo to himself, suspiciously, ""the Queen and her people"
are safe in their chambers on this floor. No person connected with the
defence ought to be down there. This is either treachery or the enemy
"of the laxity of morals in the time of Julius II. (1503-'13), that her"
friends did not hesitate to bury the famous Aspasia of that age in
"this church (St. Gregorio), and to inscribe upon her tomb: 'Imperia,"
"cortisana Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter homines formæ"
"specimen dedit.'... But this monument has now been removed.""[18]"
"Most of the facts above cited, especially those concerning the legends"
"and the Popes, except where specific acknowledgment is made to other"
"writers, have been drawn from Hare's invaluable _Walks in Rome_. Let us"
conclude the list with the testimonies of a few eminent men of
unimpeachable competence and veracity as to the character and influence
of the Roman Catholic Church as a system.
"[Sidenote: Macaulay, Dickens and Gladstone on the Influence of"
Romanism.]
"In the first chapter of his _History of England_, Lord Macaulay says:"
"""From the time when the barbarians overran the Western Empire to the"
"time of the revival of letters, the influence of the Church of Rome"
"had been generally favorable to science, to civilization, to good"
"government. But during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth"
"of the human mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom,"
"whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth,"
"and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has"
everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and
"most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in"
"poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor, while"
"Protestant countries, once proverbial for sterility and barbarism,"
"have been turned by skill and industry into gardens, and can boast of"
"a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever,"
"knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred"
"years ago, they actually were, shall now compare the country round Rome"
As teachers and workers it is an incontestable fact that Indian officers
"have distinguished themselves very highly, and anything which"
discriminates between Europeans and Indians in the way of pay and
prospects is most undesirable. A sense of injustice is ill-calculated to
bring about that harmony which is so necessary among all the members of
"an educational institution, professors and students alike."
"83, 632 (VIII) _Relations of the service with the Indian Civil Service"
and with other services._--As regards the relations with the Indian
"Civil Service, I am under the impression that they are somewhat"
"strained, but of this I have no personal experience."
"83, 633 (IX) _Other points._--I have endeavoured to give my opinion on"
the definite questions which have been asked. There is another aspect of
"educational work in India which I think of the highest importance,"
though I am not exactly sure whether it falls within the terms of
reference to the Royal Commission. I think that all the machinery to
improve the higher education in India would be altogether ineffectual
unless India enters the world movement for the advancement of knowledge.
And for this it is absolutely necessary to touch the imagination of the
people so as to rouse them to give their best energies to the work of
"research and discovery, in which all the nations of the world are now"
engaged. To aim at anything less will only end in a lifeless and
mechanical system from which the soul of reality has passed away. On
"this subject I could have said much, but I will confine myself to one"
point which I think at the present juncture to be of importance. The
Government of Bengal has been foremost in a tentative way in encouraging
research. What is necessary is the extension and continuity of this
enlightened policy.
"83, 634. _Supplementary Note._--I would like to add a few remarks to"
"make the meaning of paragraphs 83, 627 and 83, 631 in my note more"
"due to the fact that they are often metalliferous, carrying"
valuable native metals and metallic ores disseminated in fine
"particles, in strings, and sometimes in large masses in the midst"
of the valueless nonmetallic minerals which make up what is known
as the VEIN STONE.
The most common vein stones are QUARTZ and CALCITE. FLUORITE
"(calcium fluoride), a mineral harder than calcite and"
"crystallizing in cubes of various colors, and BARITE (barium"
"sulphate), a heavy white mineral, are abundant in many veins."
The gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the
metamorphic slates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Below the zone
of solution (p. 45) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz
"mingled with pyrite (p. 13), the latter containing threads and"
grains of native gold. But to the depth of about fifty feet from
"the surface the pyrite of the vein has been dissolved, leaving a"
"rusty, cellular quartz with grains of the insoluble gold scattered"
through it.
The PLACER DEPOSITS of California and other regions are gold-
bearing deposits of gravel and sand in river beds. The heavy gold
"is apt to be found mostly near or upon the solid rock, and its"
"grains, like those of the sand, are always rounded. How the gold"
came in the placers we may leave the pupil to suggest.
"Copper is found in a number of ores, and also in the native metal."
Below the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is
"often a double sulphide of iron and copper called CHALCOPYRITE, a"
mineral softer than pyrite--it can easily be scratched with a
knife--and deeper yellow in color. For several score of feet below
the ground the vein may consist of rusty quartz from which the
know it!  I feel it!  The Old Lion is not dead yet!  He shall roar again
"in his native forest.  Say, boy, will you be my helper in this thing?"
"And in the gains which we shall make we will share and share alike."""
It was a very different sort of fame from anything Grey had pictured for
"himself, and for a moment he hesitated; for he realized that were this"
"dramatic sketch to take hold of the imagination of the town, and draw"
"fashionable audiences, he could scarcely avoid recognition, disguise"
himself as he might.  But as against this there was the pressing need of
the moment.  He was well-nigh penniless; his romance seemed likely to be
"but so much waste paper.  He was hiding now even from Dick, who"
"periodically visited London to see him, lest the honest fellow should"
insist upon maintaining him from his own small hoard.  Here was an
"opening, as it seemed, to something like prosperity; and the alternative"
of being drafted into the army as a pauper recruit was scarcely
"sufficiently attractive to weigh in the balance.  Moreover, there was"
something so earnest and pathetic in the glance bent upon him by the Old
"Lion that he had not the heart to say him nay, and he held out his hand"
with a smile.
"""I will be your helper; and as for the gains, let them be yours, and you"
"shall give me what wage I merit.  The play is yours, the thought is"
yours: it is for you to reap the harvest.  I am but the labourer—worthy
"of his hire, and no more."""
"The compact was sealed, and the old man then insisted that Grey should"
"take his bed for the night, as he must sit up and remodel his play upon"
"lines indicated by the young man, who had seen the field of Ramillies"
and the disposition of troops.  Grey furnished him with sundry diagrams
"and notes, and left him perfectly happy at his task, which would"
"doubtless occupy him during the night, whilst the weary guest slumbered"
peacefully upon the humble bed in the little alcove beyond the larger
Till a few weeks ago it seemed that I shall have to look to the future
for securing the necessary expansion of scope and for permanence of the
Institute. But response is being awakened in answer to the need. The
Government have most generously intimated their desire to sanction
grants towards placing the Institute on a permanent basis the extent of
which will be proportionate to the public interest in this national
undertaking. Out of many who would feel an interest in securing adequate
"Endowment, the very first donations have come from two of the merchant"
"princes of Bombay, to whom I had been personally unknown."
A note that touched me deeply came from some girl students of the
"Western Province, enclosing their little contribution ""for the service"
"of our common motherland."" It is only the instinctive mother-heart that"
can truly realise the bond that draws together the nurselings of the
common homeland. There can be no real misgiving for the future when at
the country's call man offers the strength of his life and woman her
"active devotion, she most of all, who has the greater insight and larger"
faith because of the life of austerity and self-abnegation. Even a
solitary wayfarer in the Himalayas has remembered to send me message of
cheer and good hope. What is it that has bridged over the distance and
blotted out all differences? That I will come gradually to know; till
then it will remain enshrined as a feeling. And I go forward to my
"appointed task, undismayed by difficulties, companioned by the kind"
"thoughts of my well-wishers, both far and near."
INDIA'S SPECIAL APTITUDES IN CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE
The excessive specialisation of modern science in the West has led to
the danger of losing sight of the fundamental fact that there can be but
"one truth, one science which includes all the branches of knowledge. How"
"monopolized the market, for the trade statistics show 17,000,000 bunches"
of bananas imported by rival companies in 1912. As for its stimulation
"of the business of the ports of New Orleans, Galveston and Mobile, and"
"its revivifying of trade along the Caribbean, both are matters of common"
knowledge.
"[Illustration: ABOVE THE CLOUDS, CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]"
The banana thrives best in rich soil covered with alluvial deposits and
in a climate of great humidity where the temperature never falls below
75 degrees Fahrenheit. Once established the plantation needs little
"attention, the plant being self-propagating from suckers which shoot off"
"from the “mat,” the tangled roots of the mother plant. It begins to bear"
"fruit at the age of ten or eleven months, and with the maturing of one"
bunch of fruit the parent plant is at once cut down so that the strength
of the soil may go into the suckers that succeed it. Perhaps the most
technical work of the cultivator is to select the suckers so that the
"plantation will not bring all its fruit to maturity in one season, but"
"rather yield a regular succession of crops, month after month. It was"
interesting to learn from a representative of the United Fruit Company
"at Bocas del Toro, that the banana has its dull season--not in"
"production but in the demand for it which falls off heavily in winter,"
"though one would suppose that summer, when our own fruits are in the"
"market, would be the period of its eclipse."
[Illustration: THE CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]
[Illustration: NATIVE MARKET BOAT AT CHORRERA]
While most of the fruit gathered in the neighborhood of Bocas del Toro
"is grown on land owned and tilled by the Company, there are hundreds of"
small individual growers with plantations of from half an acre to fifty
"1. Each series of the stratified rocks, except the very deepest,"
contains vestiges of life. Hence THE EARTH WAS TENANTED BY LIVING
CREATURES FOR AN UNCALCULATED LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN HISTORY
BEGAN.
2. LIFE ON THE EARTH HAS BEEN EVERCHANGING. The youngest strata
hold the remains of existing species of animals and plants and
those of species and varieties closely allied to them. Strata
"somewhat older contain fewer existing species, and in strata of a"
"still earlier, but by no means an ancient epoch, no existing"
species are to be found; the species of that epoch and of previous
epochs have vanished from the living world. During all geological
time since life began on earth old species have constantly become
extinct and with them the genera and families to which they
"belong, and other species, genera, and families have replaced"
them. The fossils of each formation differ on the whole from those
of every other. The assemblage of animals and plants (the FAUNA-
FLORA) of each epoch differs from that of every other epoch.
In many cases the extinction of a type has been gradual; in other
instances apparently abrupt. There is no evidence that any
organism once become extinct has ever reappeared. The duration of
"a species in time, or its ""vertical range"" through the strata,"
varies greatly. Some species are limited to a stratum a few feet
in thickness; some may range through an entire formation and be
found but little modified in still higher beds. A formation may
"thus often be divided into zones, each characterized by its own"
"peculiar species. As a rule, the simpler organisms have a longer"
"duration as species, though not as individuals, than the more"
complex.
previously opposed him at the Royal Society. The plagiarism was
subsequently discovered and led to much unpleasantness. It is not
necessary to refer any more to the subject except as explanation of the
fact that the determined hostility and misrepresentations of one man
succeeded for more than ten years to bar all avenues of publication for
his discoveries. But every cloud has its silver lining; this incident
"secured for him many true friends in England who stood for fair play,"
and whose friendship has proved to be a source of great encouragement to
him.
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES
Dr. Bose's next work in 1903 was the discovery of the identity of
response and of automatic activity in plant and animal and of the
nervous impulse in plant. These new contributions were regarded as of
such great importance that the Royal Society showed its special
appreciation by recommending it to be published in their Philosophical
transactions. But the same influence which had hitherto stood in his way
"triumphed once more, and it was at the very last moment that the"
"publication was withheld. The Royal Society, however, informed him that"
"his results were of fundamental importance, but as they were so wholly"
"unexpected and so opposed to the existing theories, that they would"
"reserve their judgment until, at some future time, plants themselves"
could be made to record their answers to questions put to them. This was
interpreted in certain quarters here as the final rejection of Dr.
"Bose's theories by the Royal Society, and the limited facilities which"
he had in the prosecution of his researches were in danger of being
withdrawn. And everything was dark for him for the next ten years. The
only thought that possessed him was how to make the plant give testimony
by means of its own autograph.
"""Had to stay in this last trip--been doing some work on the ether,"
"force-field theory, and other advanced stuff that I had to go to Mars"
"and Venus to get. Just got back last week. As for solving mysteries,"
"laugh while you can, old hyena. You and a lot of other dim bulbs think"
that Roeser's Rays are the last word--that there's nothing left to
discover--are going to get jarred loose from your hinges one of these
days. When I came in nine months ago they were hot on the trail of
"something big, and I'll bet they bring it in...."""
Out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo
"blast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in"
every lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:
"""For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field"
"of the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board"
will apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present
"amount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an"
"hour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute."""
"""Hipe!"" barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light sprang into"
"being upon his board, and the assistants came to attention at their"
"stations. ""Seconds! Four! Three! Two! One! LIFT!"" He touched a"
"button and a set of plunger switches drove home, releasing into the"
forty-five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power--the
fifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy that exactly
counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser.
"Simultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set"
"to the exact figure given by the computer, the _plus_-equilibrium"
power--which would not be changed throughout the journey if the ideal
acceleration curve were to be registered upon the recorders--and the
immense mass of the cruiser of the void wafted vertically upward at a
"low and constant velocity. The bellowing, shrieking siren had cleared"
"blossoms. She had enemies, of course. Most of the other queens were her"
"enemies, and tried to do her harm. But it was useless telling tales of"
"her to the king, for the king never believed; and she walked so wisely"
"and so well, that she never fell into any snare. But still the plots"
never ceased.
"There was one day when she was sitting alone in the garden pavilion,"
"with the trees making moving shadows all about her, that the king came"
"to her. They talked for a time, and the king began to speak to her of"
"her life before she came to the palace, a thing he had never done"
"before. But he seemed to know all about it, nevertheless, and he spoke"
"to her of her brother, and said that he, the king, had heard how no man"
"was so strong as this blacksmith, the brother of the queen. The queen"
"said it was true, and she talked on and on and praised her brother, and"
"babbled of the days of her childhood, when he carried her on his great"
"shoulder, and threw her into the air, catching her again. She was"
"delighted to talk of all these things, and in her pleasure she forgot"
"her discretion, and said that her brother was wise as well as strong,"
and that all the people loved him. Never was there such a man as he. The
"king did not seem very pleased with it all, but he said only that the"
"blacksmith was a great man, and that the queen must write to him to come"
"down to the city, that the king might see him of whom there was such"
great report.
"Then the king got up and went away, and the queen began to doubt; and"
the more she thought the more she feared she had not been acting wisely
"in talking as she did, for it is not wise to praise anyone to a king."
"She went away to her own room to consider, and to try if she could hear"
"of any reason why the king should act as he had done, and desire her"
brother to come to him to the city; and she found out that it was all a
"plot of her enemies. Herself they had failed to injure, so they were now"
"plotting against her through her brother. They had gone to the king, and"
"admirer of Erasmus, had requested him to direct his attention to the"
"fact that in his interpretation of St. Paul, especially in that of the"
"epistle to the Romans, Erasmus had failed to conceive the idea of"
"_justitia_ correctly, had paid too little attention to original sin: he"
might profit by reading Augustine.
"The nameless Austin Friar was Luther, then still unknown outside the"
"circle of the Wittenberg University, in which he was a professor, and"
the criticism regarded the cardinal point of his hardly acquired
conviction: justification by faith.
Erasmus paid little attention to this letter. He received so many of
"that sort, containing still more praise and no criticism. If he answered"
"it, the reply did not reach Spalatinus, and later Erasmus completely"
forgot the whole letter.
"Nine months afterwards, in September 1517, when Erasmus had been at"
"Louvain for a short time, he received an honourable invitation, written"
"by the first prelate of the Empire, the young Archbishop of Mayence,"
Albert of Brandenburg. The archbishop would be pleased to see him on an
occasion: he greatly admired his work (he knew it so little as to speak
"of Erasmus's emendation of the Old Testament, instead of the New) and"
hoped that he would one day write some lives of saints in elegant style.
"The young Hohenzoller, advocate of the new light of classical studies,"
"whose attention had probably been drawn to Erasmus by Hutten and Capito,"
"who sojourned at his court, had recently become engaged in one of the"
boldest political and financial transactions of his time. His elevation
"to the see of Mayence, at the age of twenty-four, had necessitated a"
"papal dispensation, as he also wished to keep the archbishopric of"
Magdeburg and the see of Halberstadt. This accumulation of
ecclesiastical offices had to be made subservient to the Brandenburg

"we are accustomed to say that they are very backward, and that they"
have remained children for a long time. People are in the habit of
saying strange things.”
Felix Adler says: “Perhaps the chief attraction of Fairy Tales is due
to their representing the child as living in brotherly friendship with
"nature and all creatures. Trees, flowers, animals, wild and tame, even"
the stars are represented as comrades of children. That animals are
only human beings in disguise is an axiom in the Fairy Tales. Animals
"are humanised, that is, the kinship between animal and human life"
is still keenly felt; and this reminds us of those early animistic
interpretations of nature which subsequently led to doctrines of
metempsychosis.”[33]
I think that beyond question the finest animal stories are to be found
"in the Indian Collections, of which I furnish a list in the Appendix."
With regard to the development of the love of nature through the
"telling of the stories, we are confronted with a great difficult in the"
"elementary schools, because so many of the children have never been out"
"of the towns, have never seen a daisy, a blade of grass and scarcely a"
"tree, so that in giving, in form of a story, a beautiful description"
"of scenery, you can make no appeal to the retrospective imagination,"
and only the rarely gifted child will be able to make pictures whilst
"listening to a style which is beyond his everyday use. Nevertheless,"
"once in a way, when the children are in a quiet mood, not eager for"
"action but able to give themselves up to the pure joy of sound, then"
it is possible to give them a beautiful piece of writing in praise of
"Nature, such as the following, taken from _The Divine Adventure_, by"
Fiona Macleod:

has installed along the Central and South American coasts a wireless
telegraph service of the highest power and efficiency. It has
"constructed hundreds of miles of public roads, maintains public schools,"
and in other ways renders at its own expense the services which are
presumed to fall on governments. The American financiers associated with
it are now pushing to completion the Pan-American railroad which soon
"will connect New York with Panama by an all-rail route, and thus realize"
what once was esteemed an impractical dream.
But it is the United Fruit Company’s activities in Panama only that are
pertinent to this book. They demonstrate strikingly how readily one
natural opportunity afforded by this land responded to the call of
"systematic effort, and there are a dozen products beside the banana"
which might thus be exploited.
[Illustration: A PILE OF REJECTED BANANAS
The fruit is thrown out by the company’s inspectors for scarcely visible
flaws]
"On the Atlantic coast, only a night’s sail from Colon, is the port of"
"Bocas del Toro (The Mouths of the Bull), a town of about 9000"
"inhabitants, built and largely maintained by the banana trade. Here is"
"the largest and most beautiful natural harbor in the American tropics,"
and here some day will be established a winter resort to which will
flock people from all parts of the world. Almirante Bay and the Chiriqui
"Lagoon extend thirty or forty miles, dotted with thousands of islands"
"decked with tropical verdure, and flanked to the north and west by"
superb mountain ranges with peaks of from seven to ten thousand feet in
height.
"There was a great deal of traffic between the town and station, and it"
"was supposed that the passenger traffic would pay the contractor well,"
apart from his mail subsidy. For Burmans are always free with their
"money, and the road was long and hot and dusty. I often passed that"
"coach as I rode. I noticed that the ponies were poor, very poor, and"
"were driven a little hard, but I saw no reason for interference. It did"
"not seem to me that any cruelty was committed, nor that the ponies were"
actually unfit to be driven. I noticed that the driver used his whip a
"good deal, but then some ponies require the whip. I never thought much"
"about it, as I always rode my own ponies, and they always shied at the"
"coach, but I should have noticed if there had been anything remarkable."
"Towards the end of the year it became necessary to renew the contract,"
and the contractor was approached on the subject. He said he was
willing to continue the contract for another year if the mail subsidy
was largely increased. He said he had lost money on that year's working.
When asked how he could possibly have lost considering the large number
"of people who were always passing up and down, he said that they did not"
ride in his coach. Only the European soldiers and a few natives of India
"came with him. Officers had their own ponies and rode, and the Burmans"
either hired a bullock-cart or walked. They hardly ever came in his
"coach, but he could not say what the reason might be."
"So an inquiry was made, and the Burmese were asked why they did not ride"
"on the coach. Were the fares too high?--was it uncomfortable? But no, it"
was for neither of these reasons that they left the coach to the
soldiers and natives of India. It was because of the ponies. No Burman
would care to ride behind ponies who were treated as these ponies
"were--half fed, overdriven, whipped. It was a misery to see them; it was"
twice a misery to drive behind them. 'Poor beasts!' they said; 'you can
"see their ribs, and when they come to the end of a stage they are fit to"
fall down and die. They should be turned out to graze.'

"I'll bid 25,000!"
I'll buy it.
Any more bids?
Who's got gold?
brat!
Looks like you want a double suicide.
But you're going to make your trip to Hell alone.
Don't make me laugh.
Who could be beaten by a brat like you?
Don't you get it yet?
That armored suit is as good as a toy in front of me.
Why don't you stop profaning God's temple with your blood already?
God's temple?
Where is God in this room?
and the one who wields it is God.
Which part of this extermination equipment is God?
!
is only given to the chosen one.
A person like you has no right to be on this ark.
You're just another person who's being used!
You're just an expendable item to your government!
Don't you see that?
!
My plans no longer have anything to do with the Pentagon or the Machiner's Squad.
I'll judge these rotten human beings with my own hands.
You've gotta be kidding!
Stay back!
You bastard..!
He's dead.
"Project name... ""Cosmos."
The Pentagon's special experimental unit in which elite killers are trained since childhood.
Number 43.
Don't call me by a number.
Yu Ominae....
I've heard the rumor... didn't you?
Number 43!
"On a real diamond,it evaporates immediately."
"It's,uh,staying."
Because it's a fake.
"Give it one more try,just to make sure."
I'm not blowing on you again.
Question three.
"""Why buy a shovel?"""
-Oops.
-No.Sorry.
"""Why bury a shovel?"""
I have no answer to that.
"But here,how about this one?"
who is darkman?
that is thquestion.
Liam neeson in the 1990 cult classic directed by sam raimi about a mentally unstable scientist who seeks revenge.
"You left out ""who shot rebecca?"""
That was my next question.
Siri claims she was out walking at the time of the shooting.no witnesses.
Gsr tests came back negative.
"Even if siri shot rebecca, I don't think she killed finn."
I saw her face when she saw his body.
"If siri's innocent,she'd assume that rebca's guilty and she'd seek revenge."
Shting someone in broad daylight is just dumb.
"You're not thinking like a jealous woman, ziva."
They're keeping rebecca in the hospital overnight.
"She lost a lot of blood,but the wound was through and through."
Anything on the shooter?
Said she didn't get a good look at her.
How'd she know it was a her?
Rebeccsaid she heard a female voice at the door.
"When she opened it,bang."
Siri?
To be seen together ?
Why are you getting mad ?
I'm just being honest.
Nobody wants to see us together.
We spend more time defending our relationship than having one.
It'sjust... so hard.
Everything's gotta be easy ?
"That's the story ofyour life, not mine."
You know this much about my life.
"I know when shit gets rough, you give up and punk out."
Just the way you punked out on ballet when your mom died.
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom !
God !
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
It'sjust that... all this shitjust kind of caught me off guard.
"I mean, it's, like, damn, you don't wanna be with me."
"is that what you're saying, that you don't want to be with me ?"
"No, it's not like that."
"I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're taking it personal."
"Let me tell you something, Sara."
I just hit the best friend I have in the world in the face overyou.
I've been taking shit from people I've known all my life.
"People I care about, that care about me so I could be with you."
Telling myselfthat we are in this together.
"So, don't give me this ""nothing personal."" l don't wanna hear it."
"Fine. lf l'm messing up your life so much, then maybe we shouldn't be together."
You know what ?
I don't need this shit.
ldon't even know whylbother.
I'm out.
You remember the question 4?
"No, of course not."
Addons to the fourth question is:
"""With how many men you sleep"""
That's not your job.
Addons That's not my job?
Then you add the Addons test results in your public profile?
"Are you happy and Addons to believe that you Kinky,"
Addons but fear to tell the truth.
Addons
- With how many people are sleeping?
"- I say, it's none of your business."
I bet there are 10 in the record.
"Addons Well, Gwen."
Addons Let me help you to explain this.
Addons you have access to a lot of forums ...
"Addons But, you are active, from 5 to 15 times a week."
Virtual reality.
Addons Your avatar shows a white rose ...
"Addons And your screen name is ""Terry Bomb""."
Addons So Terry bomb ...
Addons How many people have you slept with?
- Nine
Not have to end like this
Addons you hide behind a user name behind the avatar
"Addons But wherever you go Apapunyang you download, upload, is Online locked and stored"
Addons A trail of information available for those who want it.
"Addons downloads fact, every website visited You've visited in the last 1 month"
Addons And we made some discoveries.

Any financial support whatsoever.
How much is this gonna cost me?
We'll do it for free.
Free to her.
I didn't say we won't get paid.
"Book rights,movie rights--"
"Press like this, we're gonna get paid."
Trust me.
"I told you we'd handle it, but we've gotta move fast."
Take her purse and her cell phone.
"News coverage means the chance of you getting a fair trial is going down by the second,"
So we've got to do everything we can before we turn you in.
You just need to answer one question.
I told you.
It was self-Defense.
That's not the question.
Don't guess!
Ron.
What did you do with the knife?
Threw it away?
That's not good.
"Plus,she's too calm to have just killed someone."
"She's not calm,alden."
She's numb.
Not too numb to come here instead of going to the cops.
You think she's lying to us?
A married man and a college girl go to a hotel room together--
"Someone's lying about something, and that's before anyone dies."
The d.A. Will argue that she ditched the knife
We heard that you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us in.
I heard that you are Manwol pirates.
Is that true?
Yes.
Do you know the whereabouts of Yum Moon?
"I saw him in Yongeum, but I haven't seen him since."
How can we trust you?
"It's the head of Yong-su, the leader of the Manwol pirates."
"He refused our plea to surrender, and tried to go under the command of Head Chief Yum Moon."
It is a head.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
- Do you accept those terms?
"- Yes, sir."
We will attack Chunghae now.
We must kill Jang Bogo and his security officers to avenge the master's death.
Go to battle!
To battle!
ANGELS IN FAST MOTION
I'm a pusher frau from Jutland.
I'm having my period.
"It gives me a stomach-ache, and I feel nauseous."
I've got 1800 grams of hashish taped to my body   and then this happens...!
Asger had said there'd be no police.
He promised me there'd be no police.
It never went wrong before.
First I take the train to Copenhagen and then on to Christiania to get the stuff from our dealer.
- How are things in Jutland?
- Okay.
And here?
-Excellent.
"A theorist named Zena sent us an old French map that has a bunch of locations that correspond to the island,"
-that are known.
-Okay.
And one of them that's unknown is a hatch.
"Themapis avery rudimentary sketch, if you will, of the island."
"You know, I mean, are we hoping that it's a trap door?"
- Absolutely.
But perhaps you have an explanation of it.
"And, really, the only way to do it is to set eyes on it, so..."
Yeah.
Why don't...
why don't we take a look.
Couldtheso-calledhatch reallybeevidence of an underground tunnel onOakIsland?
Perhapsonethatleads directly to the Money Pit?
"It'dbeincredibly intriguing if he says,"
"""Youguysreallyare  onto something here."
"""It's a possibility that it's a shaft, a tunnel, aman-madeopeningtothearea below Oak Island."""
"Idon'tknowwhathe's gonna say, but perhaps he can give us some insight."
Just a hole in the ground.
It's odd.
"Has it collapsed in, did you say?"
- Some.
- Here's the thing.
"This is all flat, then sometime later,"
-all this earth goes somewhere.
-Yeah.
That's what puzzles us.
It's just not a natural phenomena.
-Yeah.
-I don't believe it.
-Definitely.
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course at my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"- Spider, right?"
- Not the nickname I heard.
We're done.
"I'm gonna go and stay with my sister, now."
"I assume we never meet again, which is a tragedy I'll just have to live with."
Here are the keys to the flat.
- We're not finished yet.
"- We had an agreement, Lenny."
I think you overestimated your ability to insist on deal breakers.
- You gave me an undertaking.
- To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"- Send me back to prison, then, please."
- We can do that.
- Then do it.
"- Only this time, it's for life."
I'll make sure of it.
- You were never gonna set me free.
"- Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela - that's her name - she's gonna be down here dancing on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
To me.
If only it had found me first.
If only I could have stepped in front of him.
"Regrets are pathetic, aren't they?"
I was tired of being the white-shoe litigator.
Defending the arbitrageurs...
... andthe'80sgo-goboys .
"All it took was $50,000 to change my life."
"Fifty thousand, and the judgeship was mine."
"Absurd, isn't it?"
"The mayor has the highest regard for you, judge."
And I for him.
Your resignation in about six months would be appropriate.
"Six months, did you say?"
How about six hours?
This is the scene at the D.A. 's office  where city officials have been brought in for questioning in the story surrounding the resignation of Judge Walter Stern.
"After the checks and balances rap, we'll go into:"
"""""Revelations are not unprecedented."
"Consider Judge Wachtler, a man of impeccable credentials..."

-Leave the Wachtler stuff in there.
-Just say it plain.
-You know the rest.
Sharks are getting hungry.
Give them a one-minute sign.
Look.
"Lean and hungry, even the fat ones."
Any news?
Got anything?
"Thirty seconds, ladies and gentlemen."
Hospitals simply are going insane.
We've already reached the limit.
Maybe you should give up.
"A comatose patient is also a person, right?"
There are people who have woken up after 17 years!
What if my father wakes up?
"Just because of money, you decided to give up on my father?"
I already said I would pay the money.
Please carry out the stent surgery.
Hurry.
Please save my father.
Go ahead with the surgery.
Everything is settled.
I've already paid for the surgery.
"Here, your hand phone."
Wait a moment!
You... why did you help me?
I didn't help you.
I just don't want to hear that someone died because of me.
Thank you very much.
I'll pay you back the money.
Please give me your bank account number.
There's no need.
That money is only chewing gum money to me.
I'll just think of it as a donation to the poor.
It's just a small donation I gave you.
I...
"Seriously, I mean you can't compare the absence of a father with chewing gum!"
"And you can't classify us as ""poor people""."
I still owe you a debt.
Thank you!
I will surely pay you back.
"""Thou thy worldly task hath done"

A treasure house awaits your unlocking of mighty language and great thoughts.
"But you speak poetically, Colonel."
"- I'm sorry, I did not mean to."
- Pray do not apologise.
I did not know you were interested in literature.
You could not.
I do not believe the subject has ever arisen between us... until now.
"Miss Marianne, may I venture a proposal?"
A proposal?
Allow me to select a book for you from Mr Palmer's extensive library.
"It may help pass the time while you remain here, and it would give me great pleasure."
Thank you.
"Yes, I would be delighted."
And perhaps we might discuss it when I visit you at Barton.
You are to visit us at Barton?
Oh...
You did not know?
Your mother has invited me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"- Thank you, Mrs Wallis."
"- Thank you, miss."
I wish you a good journey.
"And you, Mrs Jennings."
What can I say to you?
"I'll have no thanks, my dear."
I've enjoyed every moment the two of you spent with me.
I'm grateful for the pleasure of the company of such lovely people.
"Now then, I wish you no more sorrows and much future happiness."
Bless you.
Love is getting kindled...
Sight is going beyond the eyes.
"(Are you) The flower of inner sun, or my penance?"
Is this love or enemity?
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?
He isn't picking my calls.
He can't run away from us.
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow
Things may turn ugly.
"- Who's that, Deepa?"
Someone I know.
"Any problem, Deepa?"
No.
Nothing.
"Are you the woman past desires, The one ruling all my desires?"
Are you the one to rope the moon in your forehead?
"You became the enchanted forest in one single flower, my lady"
Are you the one to pour nectar on that day?
The thought of you approaches me and burns my soul.
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.
You are my companion.
I like Varun a lot.
Francois.!
Kali.!
Come here.!
"Look here, Smith."
Why can't we do business?
"I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton."
"We'll give you the claim, all of it."
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here.
The winter snows are coming on.
"My dear man, you call that a business proposition?"
"We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-"
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
"I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton."
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
"From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit."
"He smiled very much as you're smiling now... because, I imagine, he knew all the while... that he had that rabbit up his sleeve."
"You've something up your sleeve, perhaps."
Perhaps.
"Roll up your sleeve, Mr. Thornton."
There's no rabbit there.
"Come, come."
Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
"Careful, you idiot."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Manoj.
Based on what you said...
After cheating me as Deepa...
She didn't take much time to meet you as Ashwini.
She has met you even when I was still at the hospital.
"So, she might've chosen Manoj as the next target after you much earlier."
Yes.
So we must find out the way she finds these blind people.
Yes.
Apart from Manoj and I being blind...
What is common between us?
A blind man is cooking...
That made people to come to my restaurant.
That gave me publicity.
That helped my business as well.
Yes.
I have even written about him.
Manoj...
Has there been any newspaper article or TV news about you?
I'm not all that famous.
I'm just a simple man.
She will not come after a simple man.
- Exactly!
You are successful in your field.
You must have gotten some recognition.
You must have been received some awards.
Or any ceremonies that you have presided over as a chief guest...
Something like of that sort?
You could have spared the biscuit.
Looks like Vijay Awards memento.
"Well, I only have the one, and right now, he's putting a tv in my bedroom."
It's cute.
"At my place, he sat next to my computer."
"Oh, well, here he'll live in the garage."
Do you like that?
He does like that.
The garage?
This guy is a hall of famer and won 20 games six years in a row.
This is not the actual guy.
Fine.
Sure seems like a lot of my stuff's being relegated to the garage.
"All right, I'll find a place for this little fella."
"Great, and since you're loosening the reins on the sports memorabilia, let's find a spot for this ebay treasure."
"Gosh, we're running tight on wall space."
"Uh, what about downstairs bathroom?"
Fergie Jenkins in the garage?
Gale Sayers in the crapper?
"I don't think you're really from Chicago, lady."
"Well, I know that this is tough, but come here."
But it's just temporary.
"Soon we'll have our own place that's not mine, not yours, but ours."
I guess.
"And we'll have so much room, you'll be able to have your own den."
Really?
"Oh, yeah."
You can put all your stuff in there.
"That'll be cool, right?"
Like a man cave.
Exactly.
Can I smoke cigars in my man cave?
I don't really see it having a window.
"Wait, it's not gonna be an actual cave, is it?"
"Well, you're right."
I'm invisible.
"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin... was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff, and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
Don't get your hopes or anything else up.
I tried to connect with her... but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am.
"Well, just go simple."
Does she like TV?
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
- Sports?
- No.
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard... just slathered in Bengay.
"- Well, does she like books?"
- No.
- But I bet you do.
- Mm-hmm.
I bet you have a big...
thick... pair of bifocals.
She doesn't have daddy issues.
She has granddaddy issues.
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you."
Don't quit on a body that won't quit.
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
- Did you steal my dream journal?
- No!
Now get back in there before all your teeth fall out... and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for.
Bastard!
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are....
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Was that fight was about you?
"I didn't want to tell Caleb over the phone, but... he called right after he got off the ship, and he wanted to come over, and I said no."
What time was that?
"Just after 11:30, I think."
I told him I was sorry.
"I didn't mean to hurt him, but I couldn't help how I felt."
I told him I was in love with Brian.
And he... lost it.
"Next thing I know, Caleb's dragging me behind some store."
Starts pounding on me.
"I fought back for a little bit, and finally, I pushed him off me, then I ran."
Never saw him again.
Then where'd you go?
"Walked around for a while, cleared my head."
Got to Meredith's around 6:00.
That was seven hours after the fight.
You just walked around clearing your head?
"Caleb was my best friend, all right?"
I would never hurt him.
"We grew up together, went fishing every weekend."
We were practically brothers.
"Look, I know I'm a bad person for betraying Caleb that way."
But I didn't kill him.
The last time Caleb called he was rambling.
"Saying that he was gonna win me back, buy me a ring."
He sounded so out of it.
He was slurring like he'd been drinking.
Caleb hardly ever drank.
And that was the last time you spoke?
I can't believe
I'm never gonna hear his voice again.
"Meredith, look at me."
Thank you!
-Thank you!
-Greetings!
"well, thats where the boss sits."
"Boss, your manager says that you.."
..dont want to accept our goods?
"Dont do that with us, sir!"
We will have to auction everything!
"Sir, we will be ruined!"
Thats what I want!
Krishna?
"Yeah, your humble servant!"
Krishna!
The same man who was slapped and abused!
The same man who was thrown out of..
..the house underthe false accusation of theft!
"So, you are taking revenge forthat?"
I have forgotten about that already.
But how can I forget about the tears from my madams eyes?
How can I forget what you did with my master?
"Do you remember, how did you suddenly.."
..change yourself in the time of need?
Do you rememberthat you had denied..
..from signing the guarantee papers?
Did you remember how did the lenders take away the car?
Do you remember how did you force sirto leave cigar?
"Mr. Vicky, you guys dont remember anything."
But Krishna is aware of everything.
I am not going to accept your goods.
Go and complaint about me in the police station!
Go to court if you want!
Go!
"- No, no."
- There are consequences for disobedience!
- Tonight's the night.
"Together, my Mary we shall put on the performance of a lifetime."
Let the trial begin.
"Mary Bradbury, you stand accused of crimes most heinous."
"Witchcraft, devilry, sins against the Lord."
"Admit what you have done and repent, or you will be sentenced to murder by hanging."
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't hurt anyone.
- Yours is not the only soul on trial this day.
"You must also decide the fate of Susanna Sheldon, the young lady you brought down with your unholy ways."
- Mary... please save me.
- I didn't make her do anything.
- You lie.
"Susanna, tell the judges the truth."
- Mary Bradbury kidnapped me and forced me to commit sins against the Lord.
But...
"- What is it, Susanna?"
- Truthfully I enjoyed it.
- Do you see what your lies have wrought?
They've turned the purity of an innocent girl into the devil's plaything.
- I didn't.
I...
- You lie!
Confess!
"- No, you are a liar, Dr. Cairn."
You lied to me.
You took my faith away from me.
You are a monster.
"- As chief magistrate, I demand you go back to your position."
You're still under trial.
There's two sides to that.
I made a mistake.
"Look, you know more about this sort of thing than I do."
I don't want you thinking that we're incompetent down here in Star City.
"Let me tell you, Dale, you got the energy and dedication of 10 cops."
No shit?
No shit.
"Say, Dud."
"Let me ask you about something else I was thinking about, and if I'm full of shit, you just tell me, all right?"
All right.
"Well, sir,"
I've been thinking about moving to L.A. and joining up.
Joining up with what?
Police department.
Been on the force down here ever since I was grown.
"Hell, after 10 years of busting peeping Toms and stop sign runners,"
I'd kind of like to take a crack at the big time.
"Now I realize that getting on the force out there is no walk in the park, but, well, I figure after we wrap up this big case here, and with your recommendation..."
"Well, who knows, you know?"
I think you and me and Mackintosh can make a hell of a team.
"That's, um..."
That's an interesting idea.
Well?
"How you doing, Hurricane?"
"Hi, Larry."
"Hey Dud, this is Larry Gibson."
He's our local Smokey.
"Larry, this is Dud Cole."
He's from L.A.
How are you?
"Hi, good."
Last night some folks killed a Texas state trooper in Odessa.
"It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs..."
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
"Rise, our new-made brothers."
Rise and kill.
"Kill, lest you be killed yourselves."
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali.
Kill!
"It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them."
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
"You must get there, Din."
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel?

The whole bunch of you.
"And you, too."
You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.
They were just helping.
Exactly.

"If anyone important calls, I'll have it with me."
Do I get one last call?
No.
But you do get to go to your rooms.
Now.
Grounding Kyle.
Who would have expected it?
And he was the ringleader.
When did that start happening?
Be honest.
"You're kinda glad they did it, aren't you?"
Well?
Aren't you?
Some rules are meant to be broken.
About that.
"I think we should break some rules, too."
"Stephen, I don't want us to sail into a complacent, suburban existence without fighting the good fight."
I want you to pursue that opport U.W.
"Nicole, that's not an option."
"Well, then we need to make it one."
You can't get the chance to pursue an old dream and just pass on it.
We have mouths to feed.
We'll keep them fed.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Spring cleaning isn't just about sorting through things and getting rid of clutter.
It's about taking stock of who you are and how others see you.
"It's a chance to redefine yourself, to change expectations."
- We're to be going.
Heaven knows when we shall be back.
Why do you suppose he turned up in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?
What's more important:
why was he killed?
I bet he was a spy or something.
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?
I'll tell you later.
- (Siren Wailing)
- What is it?
l-l just feel kinda funny.
Why should he pick me out to tell?
After what we said about him last night.
"When we get in with the inspector, I'll do my best to cut the red tape."
- Fine.
Fine.
- l'm going to stretch a bit.
I'm afraid the questions will go till doomsday if you admit you knew him.
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.
"They're a cynical lot, these French."
They might refuse to believe that.
"Well, they've got to believe it."
Look at it from their point of view.
"They saw this poor fellow whispering to you, and then they saw you write something down."
Are you gonna show them what you wrote?
(Phone Ringing)
(Speaking French)
"Thank you, Mr Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary."
"Won't you come inside, madame, monsieur?"
Do me the kindness to wait.
(Horn Honks)
"Well, I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that Arab."
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.
They were talking like they were dear friends.
"Well, he probably knew him before."
What does that mean?
It means that Mr Bernard is a very mysterious man.
What?
He seemed perfectly normal to me.
"Now, what do you really know about him?"
What do I - l know his name.
"We were sitting there, we were talking."
"You don't know anything about this man, and he knows everything about you."
"0h, wait."
"He knows that you live in Indianapolis, Indiana."
He knows you're a doctor at the Good Samaritan Hospital.
"He knows that you attended a medical convention in Paris, and that you stopped off in Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca."
Alright.
He knows that you served in North Africa in an army field hospital.
"Honey, it was just a casual conversation, that's all."
"Darling, you weren't just talking casually."
"He was asking all kinds of questions, and you were answering them."
You might as well have handed him your passport.
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.
"I know this is mysterious Morocco, but we're not gonna lose our head, are we?"
- l know. I know what it is.
- What?
You're sore because this fella didn't ask you any questions.
"- 0h, hardy-har-har."
"- No, Ben, it's safe."
Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
"This is the system, beating you back."
"You wanna count cards, you do it in Atlantic City."
- Get him up.
"- Come on, kid."
Count to five.
- Count to five!
- What?
"Count to five so I know you don't have brain damage, you can go home."
Start with one.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Good.
"Now, stop counting."
Let's go.
"You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights."
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.
"Look, you're choosing to play two hands against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?"
"Against a five or a six, it'd be fine."
"Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play."
"Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?"
Jill's right.
All right?
"Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?"
"Oh, all right."
"So, our team is divided into two kinds of players, spotters and big players, right?"
"So if you think that this table is the casino floor, then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters."
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.
Maybe it's where he was planning on taking his victims.
That's what I was afraid of.
Check this out.
That's a body.
What is it?
This is the fallout to his confession.
"What do you think, he was making Putnam watch it?"
STEVE:
That's exactly what I think.
And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.
"Thought we had lost you there, cuz."
(groans) Get off me.
What happened?
You don't remember?
We were just floating out there on that life raft.
And I spotted land.
That's right.
"You were so excited, you jumped up and lost your balance."
"By the time we got you back in the raft, you had swallowed so much water, that you passed out."
Doc had to do mouth to mouth to get you breathing again.
MAX:
Ah.
"Glad to see you back on your feet, Captain."
Where the hell are we?
"Now, that is a good question."
My best bet is we're on one of the uninhabited islands of the Hawaiian chain.
Most likely Lehua.
Lehua?
"Now, all we have to do is survive until we get discovered."
"Fortunately, I had a have a head start on building the fire."
I did it while you were unconscious.
At least we'll be warm while we starve to death.
Yep !
The old Gibbs is back.
GIBBS:
"You see something, Abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean, it's tragic, but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a TV set?
- It says it all.
"- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
Still got my eyebrows.
Good point.
"I found Finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he was probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
"After being underground, it's unlikely."
"Strange case, huh?"
I had this friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.
"Um, next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Nothing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
"It's heading straight down, right for Kelso sitting in his convertible."
I'm done.
"I'm out of a job, right?"
Wrong.
"At that second, a hawk flies in, grabs the thing and flies off with it."
I know what you're thinking.
We're in a city.
What's a hawk doing there?
I can't believe you get a locker and I don't.
"Dr. Reid, I need to meet you in Radiology to go over some test results."
"Yeah, it's over, Ricky."
I know you're stealing trays.
Stop it.
Buzz off.
"Carla, the orderly lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406."
Would we have his dosages?
"You put him on penicillin, but he was allergic, so you put him on vancomycin."
Thank you.
Wish you put some of that crazy-nurse memory to use on our missing dude.
"Well, he was an older guy and he was on an IV, so he couldn't have gotten very far."
He was jittery and he had this weird circle tan line on his arm.
It was the nicotine patch.
He was trying to quit smoking.
Should I not be out here?
"There he is, Mr. Spot on His Lungs."
"Don't worry, we'll pop that lung out, get it to the dry cleaners and have it back to you after five."
We like to have fun.
I made up that whole hawk story.
Yeah.
I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.
[Clangs]
[# Tammany Hall NYC:
"Ah, I don't get much call for the good stuff anymore."
"Most of my business is just teenagers, you know... trying to get past a bouncer at a titty bar."
Titty bar.
Got no appreciation for art.
You know?
Give me your right hand.
How about folding your sleeve back?
"This stuff gets on your shirt, it'll never come out."
"And slide these on for me, if you don't mind."
"This, uh-This is you, isn't it?"
"Uh, kind of hard to tell from here."
"Put those on for me, if you don't mind."
"In some situations, a tactical retreat is your best option."
"Listen, bud."
"I'm sorry as I can be about this, but, uh... a guy like me don't stay in business very long... unless he slips the F.B.I. a bone every now and then, and let's face it..."
- you're a big old soupbone.
- I'm flattered.
Yeah.
They come through here every now and then asking about you.
A guy with a gun is a guy with a gun.
You can fight him and risk someone getting shot or wait for backup.
"You gonna be my ""get no hassles for a year""card."
Yeah.
Special Agent Allerot.
Yeah.
Tell him it's Jumbo.
"Well, how manyJumbos you think he knows?"
"Hi, honey!"
Look at the deal I got on these shoes.You're not gonna believe it.
Lady.
"Lady, you can't be back here."
- Get out of here.
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goody bags in your room - and other essentials.
- Are you going to tell me who you are?
"- You'll have to wait till tomorrow, now."
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red.
And don't be so cheeky.
Are you bursting with curiosity about the new recruit?
Yeah.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, no - when you decide the time is right."
- You know me so well.
- He's not gonna do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
- So when do you put him to work?
- I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
"Well, let's go eat and you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
- How's the cat?
"- What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one in them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
- You remember that?
- It was clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
Gentlemen...
I wouldn't come too close to the door if I were you.
Have someone guard the prisoners.
"You, stay here."
"Yes, sir."
"Of all the asinine, fool-headed behavior."
You might have been killed.
For what?
For nothing.
"Well, what good is that?"
"Have a little faith, professor."
I'd prefer a hacksaw.
"I'm sorry, MacGyver, I'm afraid we're done for."
I should never have dragged you into this.
"Well, no one twisted my arm."
"No, you don't understand."
I lied.
The Academy didn't send me.
"In fact, the, uh, directors, uh, revoked my tenure."
I mean to put it simply...
I was sacked.
Who financed the expedition?
"I did, I thought that if I could find the Torch, prove Atlantis really existed, then the Academy would reinstate me."
It took all my savings to get this far.
I could barely afford the telegram I sent asking you to come.
"I hate to deceive you like that, but, uh,"
I had no other option.
"Uh, you must believe me."
"I was at the end of my rope, MacGyver."
"Oh, please understand, I mean, y-you were the only person that I could turn to."
Story of my life.
"Anyway, it's useless,"
That's quite the Friday.
"Trick, a pint, please."
"The Ash, he's pissed, huh?"
"I told him you got there after and that we both arrived too late, so you're off the hook."
So you covered for me?
This Jenny thing's a serial killer case.
It's scored me some big points in the cop world for breaking it.
Let's just say it's returning the favour.
Cheers.
Yep.
- Still a douche.
"- Well, at least he's not a thief."
I seem to be missing a 300-year-old bottle of buckthorn mead.
You Fae and your funny words.
Look at the time.
I should be going.
Stay and let me tell you how that bottle came into my possession and why it meant so much to me.
So I was thinking.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
- No. it's good.
Listen as recent events have suggested mixing emotions and sex can get kind of messy.
- That is what I was trying to avoid.
"- Yeah, well, I get that now."
"My offer does still stand, though."
I'm here whenever you need me.
How about for more than just healing?
- How about for fun?
- For fun?
Yeah.
"There's this ""friends with benefits"" thing that I have heard so much about."
- You don't say.
"Yeah, and you're actually kind of perfect."
"Wait, to compromise, just take out Miss Chummy."
Ignoramus.
Hold it.
(Douglas) Stand right where you are.
"No, I mean Miss Thatcher."
"Mm-hmm, in something of silk."
Hurry up.
Get to the funny part so I can laugh.
"The funny part is, I've won your high hat."
Off with it please.
Tell me more.
You are now talking to one of your employers.
"The young man with a fall production, remember?"
"Oh, yes, that is funny."
Where would you get money to put into a show?
"Well, young lady, I'll tell you."
The only thing ahead was the old homestead in Connecticut.
So I put a plaster on it.
You trying to tell me you mortgaged something to buy into this show?
Any law against it?
Did my father talk you into this?
The old gentleman with a lovely daughter?
(Patricia) Answer my question.
"Well, being my oldest and dearest friend he was kind enough to introduce me to the producers."
"'Ah, just a minute.'"
- You owe my a high hat.
- Sue me?
"Oh, hello, my dear."
Just sitting here anticipating a few small profits.
Your rehearsal go well?
"Father, you got him to put everything into this show."
"But, my dear, I did him a great favor."
We're chasing PPO contracts to compete against the HMOs.
- We won't sacrifice our commitment.
- That's what Pedes is all about.
We're a family here.
The kids you see today will be the parents of the kids you'll see in 20 years.
We believe in continuity and commitment.
So do I.
- So do you want to join our family?
"- Yes, I do."
"How's she doing, Peter?"
She's stable.
We're just going over her films now.
Nasty break.
Anybody want to take a crack at reading it?
Type three tibial and fibular fracture with complete displacement.
- Thirty percent chance of nonunion.
- Excellent.
- Were knee and ankle films ordered?
- I don't believe so.
Knee and ankle films are necessary to rule out injuries from transmitted forces.
"She's right as rain, Peter."
Order the films.
Come on.
I've got a couple interesting Colles fractures you may wanna look at.
Have you ever seen a middle ear bone fracture?
- Hey.
How did the interview go?
- Great.
- What did they say?
- They said I was great.
- Did you get the job?
- Ninety grand a year and nobody dies.
Among us...
Waiting
Don't believe in him and please don't meet him again
So he won't annoy you
The kids are sleeping.
Do you have any other order my Sultana?
Take a rest you too.
Sleep
I heard you were a cruel Barbarian
Now I see with my own eyes
You haven't seen anything yet
Don't be that sad
"Look, everyone treats us good"
He told me that I have seen nothing yet
Who?
That barbarian called Süleyman
He thinks I get above myself.
Who do you think he is ?
Sultan doesn't look as a terrible barbarian.
I was surprised
True
At least fire doesn't blow out of his eyes
But his tongue is poisoned
"Your Majesty, Hürrem Sultana is here"
Let her in
"Welcome my moon, my sun"
I can't close my eyes without seeing you
I'll visit Hatice tomorrow
I'll give her a gift
I'll give her the lucky amulet you gave m
That'd be good
Visit her more frequently.
I spend 23 hours a day wondering whether we' re wrong for each other.
Wondering whether we've got the energy that we need to get through everything that we seem to get into.
Whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship.
"But in the 24th hour, I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours."
"And I come back to, there's something about her that I can't stay away from."
Something about her that makes me wanna love her.
"Julia, my sister, read this story about a little Japanese girl who had cancer."
"And she tried to make a thousand paper cranes because she thought if she did, it would make her wish come true."
- What was her wish?
- To get better.
So how many paper cuts do you have?
A lot.
But my wish is kind of different.
What is it?
It's hard to explain.
"I kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh?"
Not bad at all.
Cop wounded in a multi-car collision.
"BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats."
"Jing-Mei, take him in."
I'll wait on the next.
- Find the guys?
- The guys opened fire.
- We have a bunch of cops hurt.
"- Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer."
MVA with passenger-space intrusion.
- Can't breathe.
"- Hey, nice to see you again."
- You know him?
"- He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled."
- Isn't that right?
- Correct.
"I'm trapped at N.Y.U., and- and it's too late to transfer."
So what's wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial
"And a ""Gossip Girl"" blast or two?"
"Nothing, I guess, but you can always make it right"
With whoever you take down online.
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna have time
To do that with Lily or not?
"Morning, sunshine."
"I've got the Dom '95, your favorite."
"No, thank you."
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.
"Oh, I apologize."
Nadine left behind some of her intimates.
She must have wanted an excuse to come back.
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.
"If you're here to mock me, I'm not in the mood..."
Unless you have some punishment in mind.
"We've broken up, Chuck,"
"And frankly, I don't care what you do."
But I can't sit by and just watch you avoid Lily.
I'm actually quite busy with work.
"Well, you had time for Nadine."
"Trust me, she was work."
"And I promise you, Lily is not sitting around,"
Wondering when she's going to hear from Chuck bass.
Justify not seeing Lily all you want.
You and I both know what this is.
"You've lost Bart,"
"Elizabeth betrayed you,"
And the thought of losing Lily terrifies you.
Please.
Spare me your N.Y.U. Freshman psych analysis.
Maybe.
What did you want him to do?
The Yankees will move on.
Barney has to live here.
With that sly deal with the devil that everybody in this parish seems to have struck.
(Bloody Moybeg.)
"It's life, Rose."
We're lucky to be able to hold on to it.
Sometimes you have to use a long spoon to dine with the devil.
Especially when you're dining on corned beef.
Uh?
Nothing.
Are you sorry?
About what?
I don't know.
About the trouble you caused?
It wasn't my fault.
- You went to the pictures.
"- ""You went to the pictures""."
Neh!
"It didn't mean they had to gang up on him, the Hanlons and all, and shut up about it."
Do you think they would have killed him if Mum hadn't have...
PLANES ROAR OVERHEAD
Battle Fatigue!
Barnhill.
"Brave, decent Barnhill didn't long survive his rescue by my mother."
"A swarm of Focke Wulf 190s set on him over Dusseldorf, one moonlit night in 1944, and though he fought a long-running battle towards the Channel, he never made it."
"He is buried among the small farmyards, the barns and byres of St Joseph, close to Wormhout in Belgium."
I often wonder what my father knew about that night.
Did he decide to let Barnhill get what was coming to him for his cheek?
"I hope not, but my father was a Moybeg man."
Its darkness may have lain somewhere deep in his DNA.
I should have benched Grimes on the bin-Khalid raid.
"Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?"
He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy - I just...
"I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just..."
I tried to get his head straight.
We all missed it.
"Now my men are dead, because of Grimes."
"And now he has the list, and, uh... if any more people get killed..."
You can't put this on yourself.
Are you going to help me or not?
"Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?"
In the back of a patrol car.
You're gonna let them arrest you?
"Look, I'm a black man standing on the corner at 3rd and Decatur."
"Trust me, it won't be that hard."
"Just be ready to take care of the security cameras, okay?"
I'll call you when I'm inside.
Carter?
Drop the bag.
Where the hell you going?
- Just walking.
- Yeah?
How about you walk over there and put your hands on the wall?
"Whoa, whoa, Paul, Paul, come on, easy."
Pat him down.
"Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm."
I said pat him down.
"Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?"
"His gun, get it and kick it over here."
- Hurry up.
- All right.
All right.
"Now, I think we..."
"and by ""we"", I mean the two of you..."
Might be able to find something on there that'll give us a lead to find his West Coast counterpart.
"Rick, we need to talk."
About what?
I'll give you two the room.
[Door closes]
You remember when we first met?
How could I forget?
You sucker-punched me in the face.
No.
"No, we'd met before that."
"A year and a half earlier, to be precise."
You mean this whole time you knew?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Hayley.
Didn't lie about that.
"Technically, I didn't lie about anything."
"I misrepresented, sure, but I-I didn't lie."
But why?
"Because a year and a half ago, you asked me to."
"In fact, you begged."
I don't understand.
"So ages ago, I did some freelance work for MI-6, and I met an American spy on an op."
"He was an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip."
My father.
Jackson Hunt.
"Year and a half ago, he calls me, asks me to keep an eye out on you here in L.A."
Said you were sticking your nose where it didn't belong.
What did he say I was doing?
"[Sighs] I didn't ask, he didn't say."
"But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand, your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home."
No.
It's all right.
It's fine.
"Come on, come in."
"Um, I got your tea if you want me to make you some."
Sure.
"Yeah, that'd be nice."
"Of all the dozens of women you've been with, you must have fallen in love plenty of times."
Right?
What's this really about?
Neil.
"His, um, his other job..."
"We're working on being more open, but this little voice inside my head isn't so sure."
"So if I fell in love with you,"
"Neil could fall in love with one of his dates, too."
"Grace, you were the only one."
"Come on, I'm serious."
You don't do what I do and catch feelings.
It's the ultimate transgression.
You were it.
So you just sleep with all these women and you never feel anything intimate?
In passing.
It's that way with a lot of people.
Clients and escorts.
That's the fantasy.
That's... that's why this business is booming.
"When I met you, I was hungry for something more, emotionally."
But you were never going to leave Neil.
"It took me a while to figure that out, but..."
Neil's gonna be seeing someone tonight.
Someone I selected.
But I don't want to be the wife who sets rules and tells him what he can and can't do.
"Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade."
"So, wait."
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
"I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint."
Wow!
I can...
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...
"Oh, you think you are so s..."
"You can't decide how to storm off, can you?"
(exhales sharply) I am... (somber music plays)
(crying) Luke's first haircut.
He gave me bangs.
"- Well, that's it."
- (music shuts off)
Hopefully you're all cried out.
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow to catch the tooth fairy?
(sobs)
"Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation."
"Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face and wrap it up."
"Do you guys remember that ""Luke Loves Daddy"" rap?"
(rapping) ♪ My name is Luke Dunphy ♪
♪ And I'm here to say ♪
♪ I love Daddy ♪
(sobs)
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.
"Dad, please, you really got to stop."
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!
(sobbing loudly)
Ohh!
(sobbing continues)
"Mama, now my tooth hurts."
"- [muscles] come on, let me out."
- Everybody ok?
"- [all kids] yeah, sure."
"Oh, look what's happened to city property."
No...
But I'm still gonna take you to school.
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.
[siren approaching]
You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular
Which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,"
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
It won't change the way I feel.
"I've tried steroids, fluid restriction."
Nothing's working.
Neuro says he's not a surgical candidate.
I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now.
Okay.
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.
"Yeah, physically, but she will not forgive herself, and nothing I said was gonna get her... you guys think that when we die,"
"There's like a bookkeeper, and he tallies up everything we did... all the lives we saved, all the people we helped, and if we've done enough good in the world, that it makes up for the times that we just completely fail?"
No.
I don't think anyone's keeping score.
"I think we do what we can, we hope for the best, and that's all anybody can do, right?"
"I think, uh, I think that we..."
"we do what we can do when we know how to do it, and it hurts."
It just... it hurts.
Violet's in the kitchen.
Hello.
Hi.
Come here.
Hi.
Yes.
Yeah.
Hmm.
"So I have this 11-year-old patient, stabbed her father."
"Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma, which made her... aggressive."
"Um, Addison's gonna remove it, but this girl just can't forgive herself."
Maybe she needs more time.
Time?
So should I offer her time?
"Well, what do you want, Cooper, a magic pill?"
Bad things happen.
- We need more police.
- When you going to send us some help?
"Glad you're here, Mr. Mayor."
The father's seated in the corner.
"I'm all yours, Leslie."
Questions and answers.
Who's up?
- The Post.
- Marx or Sadler?
Sadler.
Then I know what's coming.
"""Has probation become a sentence in this town?"""
Judge Stern has a powerful record.
He served six years and meted out the stiffest punishments in the city.
"If the report recommends probation, then probation it has to be."
"After that, they'll start in on the mandatory crap."
Good morning.
I want to welcome the Revs.
Williams and Birch...
- You got the probation report?
- In the office.
I'll be there in a minute.
"- And my dear friend, Reverend Milton Parks of the First Church of Harlem Reverend Chapman and Reverend Murray."
Thank you for coming here today.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
"Well, what can I say?"
How do I start this?
"There is one thing, as Mayor that I will never get over and that is the death of a police officer."
There is one thing in life that I will never get over and that is the death of an innocent child.
But this is an incident that won't go away...
Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"The whole city  all parts of the city  Bushwick, Jamaica, Washington Heights  Brownsville, Harlem..."
"It depends on your definition of ""people,"""
and that's enough of a technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
"Take me to court, then, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and flutter."
And creak?
And what?
"""Creak."" You're creaking."
What?
Ah!
I-I'm drying out.
"Oh, sweet heavens."
Moisturize me!
Moisturize me!
Where are my surgeons?
My lovely boys!
It's too hot!
You raised the temperature.
Have pity.
Moisturize me!
"Oh, oh, Doctor!"
Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I'm...too... young.
And I love how the Doctor's so callous with her.
"Like when Rose is like ""Aren't you going to save her?"""
"And he's just like ""Everything has an end."""
"Poof! ""Aah!"" Bits of liver flying out."
"Eccleston, as the Doctor, just kills her, you know?"
"Like, he doesn't have any problem with saying this is justice -- she has to die for being bad guy."
"The way that he deals with her, versus the way that the tenth Doctor will later deal with her really kind of speaks volumes about the difference between the two of them."
They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples.
"Hello, Dad."
You just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her.
I didn't murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
One memeber of the police department agrees with him.
Thomas Hardy made this statement to the press.
I do not think Kesser is the killer.
Important information was withheld.
Can you tell us what that information is?
Two of the women were called from police call boxes.
Why didn't you say that?
.
A Pittsburgh cop did it!
An offical police report denied Hardy's accusations.
The controversy has not changed Kesser's death sentence.
Airtight case.
Kesser had no alibi at all.
He confessed to the murder of his accomplice as self-defense.
He denied the Polish Hill murders.
"We found evidence from the murders in his hotel room,   and the gun that killed Vince Hardy."
Then why does Hardy think that Kesser was framed?
Kesser's fingerprints weren't on the gun.
It was a police special.
The serial numbers were erased.
Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
- He thinks the killer's a cop.
- No one thought he was innnocent?
"Yeah, Kesser."
"Well, Bob, he's putting them in the Allegheny or the Monongahela."
That narrows it down.
This is Hardy here.
Go.
"Hi, it's Jo."
Are you going to the policeman's ball tonight?
"Unless Emilie has come back to life, the meeting will begin in a minute, with or without you."
- I'll contact the Ministry of Justice.
- Do that.
I was about to suggest it.
- How the hell did he get away?
- I don't know.
- They're still looking for him.
- You were right.
Emilie wasn't shot.
She wasn't there.
"They're searching his car for clues,"
- What the hell have you found then?
- Louise Hjelby's crime scene.
It seems she was picked up by her killer in a black car on her way home.
"He took her to an old boat builder's yard, where she was held captive and abused."
- Then he faked a suicide in the harbour.
- And the perpetrator found this place?
"He's trying to find whoever did it, with a notebook he's acquired."
- What notebook?
"- A bay was writing down license plates,"
The perpetrator took the book from Borch.
- The Zeuthens have just arrived.
- How did Borch get that book?
You'll have to ask Borch or Special Branch about that.
There was a reason.
I'd like to explain.
I don't want...
We've searched the dunes and the beach with a team of dogs.
- They lost the scent by the stream.
- He's on foot.
He's wounded.
They think he followed the stream inland.
They're like d--dustbin lorries.
He goes round picking up every bit of rubbish he can lay his lobes on!
They're a lot nicer ears than many I've had to see to.
"Now, listen."
"As the person you're supposed to be engaged to,"
I don't much like this comparison of some of the things you've had to see to!
And I can well understand why!
"""And I can well understand why."""
"Granville, now listen."
Stand there.
"The minute Nurse Gladys Emanuel goes into her house, you're out again on the street."
"Oh, dear."
"Look, she's been caught by Mrs Pendlebury."
"Oh, dear!"
"She's a very peculiar sh--shape, is Mrs Pendlebury."
Can't be very convenient for Mr Pendlebury.
He often comes in here quite late of an evening for his six--pack of ale with a desperate look in his eye.
"She'll be there for half an hour, you mark my words."
"Ah, good."
A reprieve!
At last I've had a reprieve.
-
"- Not for long, Granville."
-
"- Oh, 'eck!"
Do I have to go out there?
They'll only laugh at me.
I know they'll only laugh.
"Come on, chin up!"
"You come from proud stock, lad."
"Waterloo, the B--Battle of Britain, the Glorious Double Gloucesters!"
"We are a stubborn race, when the chips are down."
- Where´s Richards?
- He´s waiting.
Let´s bring him in.
(Michelle) Send Darren in.
"Nina, I don´t think you´ve met Darren Richards."
He joined us after you left.
"Hello, Darren."
Don´t take it personally.
He doesn´t talk much.
"(Rae) Something´s not connecting up for me, Jack."
"You weren´t in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December."
That´s six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one.
Am I missing something?
I was trying to pass as ajunkie.
I wanted to be prepared.
"- What do you mean, prepared?"
- The Salazars lived in the drug world.
"If I couldn´t handle the narcotics, they´d have known I was a cop and killed me."
- l needed to be able to handle it.
- That makes sense.
"But in January, when you were injecting, you didn´t have a meeting on the books."
- lt could have been a year for all you knew.
- What are you saying?
I am trying to establish evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover.
"If I submit this, it´s not gonna hold up."
What do you want me to say?
!
I did drugs to get in with these people and I got in with them!
"No matter how difficult it´s been, I don´t use any more."
"Look, I´ll write it up that way and maybe it´ll fly, but I think you´ll have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner."
That´s suspicious.
"Rae, you know my history."
And what have you got?
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
- How could that possibly matter?
"- What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
- It means everything.
- What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
You think you're not a part of this?
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
- Safety's off.
It's good to go.
- I don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
But let me tell you something.
I'd rather blow one in 100 than send 10 men away on mandatories who don't deserve them.
You sound like an enlightened man.
And you sound like you're fucking with me.
"You have anything to add, Abe?"
It's okay.
You're doing fine.
Everybody will want to know how these things happen.
How long have you been on this job?
Three years.
"Look, these things happen because we are awash here."
"In criminals, in half-baked social workers in a city that doesn't function, in a world that doesn't know right from wrong."
- Mr. Schwartz?
- Larry.
I owe you an apology.
No apologies.
I came in here with a big head of steam.
It was inappropriate.
"Look, it takes more than 3 years to get up to speed in this department."
Only one man would have made a good probation officer:
Kafka.
And he wasn't available.
"Thank you, Larry."
Call me if something opens up in the big building.
"You know, keep me in mind."
He'll be right with you.
South Brooklyn Democratic Club.
I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever.
Have your son stop by.
I'll be happy to take care of it.
"Gussie, come on in."
"Hello, Mr. Anselmo."
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened... but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before the reactor is brought online?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.
What is it?
A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
Tactical Alert.
"Captain Archer, report to the Bridge."
It's an Insectoid.
Three bio-signs aboard.
They're firing.
They're moving away at full impulse.
Pursuit course.
Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.
[Grave instrumental music]
No effect.
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.
Torpedoes.
Maximum yield.
Target their impulse manifolds.
CREWMAN:
Ready.
REED:
Fire.
ARCHER:
What the hell's going on?
What's that look?
- What look?
"- The look, right there."
The one you get when you worry.
Nothing.
Nah.
"When you're done with host committee, why don't you come on inside."
"I'll be in the library with your uncle, okay?"
Senator.
I got to meet with the FCC.
They didn't know what hit 'em.
Thanks so much for coming.
Thanks for your help.
"Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."
A pleasure.
I'm making breaching charge.
The last one I used blew the hinges off
A metal door in Kandahar.
"I need you to get me through security, into your police station, and then into the evidence lockers."
Narco seized a ton of heroin and cash last week.
That's what he's after.
"Listen, I don't expect you to believe me, but if I don't get that money, a lot of people are gonna die."
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Okay, I didn't wake up this morning thinking this was gonna happen to me, either."
"I don't want to hurt anybody, but here's the deal."
"You're gonna do what I say, when I say it."
"You're gonna rob the station, that's crazy."
Yeah.
I keep hearing that.
"Isaac, we can't let him do this."
I want to talk to him.
To try to change his mind?
Sort of.
"Because as your lawyer, I wouldn't..."
"You know what, it's your life."
You do what you want.
What?
It's the Veriscene case.
The judgment's in.
We find out tomorrow.
That's good.
I don't know.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.
How's everyone this morning?
"Well, Your Honor."
We seem to have a designated hitter here today.
"Yes, Your Honor."
"My partner, Will Gardner, couldn't be in court..."
"Oh, you don't have to cover for him."
I know Will's suspended.
- How's he doing?
"- Very well, thank you for asking."
Like a kid with five days until Christmas.
"Well, tell him he's missed."
Shall we get started?
"Plaintiff alleges that Veriscene, a drug administered for the cure of acne, caused Mr. Goode irreversible sterility."
"Accordingly, I am entering judgment for the plaintiff, in the amount of $25 million in compensatory."
"I acknowledge that this amount is in excess of the $18 million requested by the plaintiff, but I find the actions here particularly heinous."
- Your Honor...
"- Yes, Mr. Canning?"
You want to appeal?
"- Oh, I do."
Uh vehemently.
- As is your right.
"No, never it would make a thing thus, but it is precise that it comes with me."
That it goes where?
-To accompany.
-Where?
It does not touch to me.
"-The request, comes with me."
-To where I must accompany to him.
I will explain it.
In the ambulance there is a young person of only 20 years... in touch between the life and the death...
And what I can do?
It watches in what state is.
It sees it?
Here he is.?
How it goes?
poor.
"Yes, poor, is in evil been."
He is on the verge of dying.
And it knows which are the words that continue repeating in their delirium?
I love a woman.
Before dying... it would want the incommensurable one to please to see a woman.
"It is right, poor"
"He hears, you you would only have to do this:"
"to enter there, to open themselves just a little bit, to embosom a little to him the legs..."
But...
"Do it, will make a good karma and tomorrow all the angels of the sky will sing your name."
-Which is her name?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
Brígida Bonazzi.
"Yes, all the angels of the sky they will sing: ""Brígida Bonazzi,..."""
"Salt of there, salt of there."
"It enters there, enters there..."
Brígida Bonnazzi.
He was gonna propose to her.
What's that got to do with anything?
It's got everything to do with it!
"Jared would do anything for Dana, and she knew it, too."
"That's why she wanted to straighten out her life, l-look for a way out."
Dana was part of the heist crew.
"Yeah, but..."
but she wanted to quit.
For Jared.
Except they wouldn't let her.
Who's they?
The rest of the team?
"No, no, no."
Not everyone was involved.
I wasn't either.
I didn't know about the robberies until Dana told me at the hospital.
I swear.
"So, what was Dana's job on the crew?"
"She was the getaway driver, but like I said, she wanted out, she threatened to come clean if they didn't let her go."
"So, what, they stabbed Jared to warn her?"
They found out that Dana was gonna tell him the truth about the heists.
"She convinced Jared not to go to the hospital, so he wouldn't get hurt worse."
"Dana couldn't tell Jared the truth, either."
She just asked him to... to trust her.
And the money in Jared's garage.
It was her cut.
She decided to tell...
Jared the truth this weekend and... somehow they found out.
Which is why they killed Jared.
"And they... and they threatened to kill her and, um... and me, too, if... if she tried anything else."
That's why I was afraid to tell you the truth.
They're vicious.
All I wanted was to get the best film possible out of this.
We might not like how Kyle operates but the audience loves controversy.
"And if you don't have an audience, you're nothing."
"So the more immoral he is, the more you like him?"
Welcome to showbiz.
"Looks like you found your soul mate, after all."
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
If you're that desperate to save something go sponsor a panda.
Steve!
We're leaving.
Film makers observe they don't interfere.
That's just how it is.
That's pathetic.
You turn a blind eye to something you know isn't right.
"Hey, he's the bad guy, here, not me."
There's nothing I can do to stop him.
Maybe you're scared if you do stop him you won't get a film out of it.
Doesn't it occur to you that he might be using you the way he used us?
So?
I'm using him back.
We're even.
But it isn't right!
"OK, how about this?"
Don't audiences love an unexpected twist?
Are you sure this is an actual road?
Yeah.
"Not too many people know about it, but it's a good shortcut."
As long as you avoid the bog.
So...
"Now that they know our location and vitals,"
It will be perilous to continue with the expedition.
We should head back to BuYeo.
Sa-Yong is right.
"Miss,"
"Those people are with a vengeance, and they'll surely hunt us down."
Our best bet is to avoid them.
"We'd better go back, Miss."
I heard they still address their leader as 'Commander'.
"Ah, what's the use?"
They're nothing but bandits.
Hey don't look down on them.
They're even tougher than the average Heng-In soldier.
These men will gladly jump into fire at a word from their officers.
No wonder even the imperial guards are no match for them.
I... guess this is for real.
Brother.
Seems it's reckless to continue with this expedition.
We should go back to BuYeo.
"Yes, I agree."
"Brother, please convince So Seo-No."
"Truthfully,"
"No matter what adversities I may come across,"
I would still want to reach Go-San Nation.
But the fleet ultimately belongs to So Seo-No.
I guess we have to wait for her decision.
Follow me.
Where to?
To the bandit's hideout.
What?
!
Why?
"""Mr. Belfort done lost his mind."
"He done lost his mind."""
"I said, ""Does anybody else smell pancakes right now?"""
'Cause I do.
"Anytime you hear somebody say, ""Oh, Lord!"""
They are old as hell.
I'm serious.
I was watching a porno the other day.
And I didn't know how old the lady was until the dude hit the spot real good.
"He said, ""Pow!"""
"She said, ""Whoo!"
"Oh, Lord!"""
"I said, ""I ain't watching this no more."""
"""Smell like cookies and love in here."
"This remind me of Nana."""
"Oh, pfft!"
Sound like my ex-girlfriend.
¶ What my girl say.
"Now, I don't know if y'all have seen that sketch."
Yes.
"But look, if you laughed at it, you was laughing at my life, 'cause it was based off of some painful shit."
"I'm gonna be honest with you, it was about me and my ex."
"We're not together no more, know what I mean?"
"But let me tell you something, my parents have been together for 33 years."
And you don't have a 33--
And you do not have 33 years of a relationship without going through little bumps and bruises.
"And if they can't get through the bumps and bruises, forget about 'em."
"Find you somebody that's your ride-or-die, you know what I'm talking about?"
Find you somebody else.
That's got to be the yin to your yang.
The peanut butter to your jelly.
The Gayle King to your Oprah.
"Yes, Miss Sheetal?"
What makes you remember me?
Did someone flirt with you again?
"No, nothing as such."
I read in the papers about your chase with the smugglers.
Did you read it?
They have glorified you.
I thought of congratulating you.
And I called you up.
Oh I see.
Now I get it.
I wondered why'd a pampered rich girl phone a pem police officer.
"But someone said it right, that today's girls are impressed by famous people."
You must've already boasted to eveyone that you know me vey well.
"You must be getting a lot of attention, don't you?"
What?
What do you think of me?
My mistake to call you up!
What do you think ofyourself?
A pem police officer.
What's the matter?
You seem to be short-tempered.
You think you've earned international fame with a piece ofyour exploits in the papers?
You think I called you because I am impressed by your fame?
Ifthis is not the reason...then there is only one reason leR.
And that reason you and I know vey well.
I'll definitely give it a thought.
Have seen yourself in the mirror?
I am afraid... yes.
While shaving today morning.
"Actually, my face is vey expressive."
Especially my eyes.
- Great song.
- It's a great song.
"I'm seeing some of the faces in the background and remembering all these people that we spent, like, two weeks with."
There was one female extra that had a thing for Kat.
- One female extra?
- Just one.
"One that came up and said something, but half a dozen had their eye on you."
"A little, like, ""Oh, yeah."""
"There was one female extra, blond girl in a hat, female extra who worked her way into every shot in the first third of the movie."
Really?
"You know what, I have to say it was a point of frustration."
"Because I felt like every shot we cut to, she'd snuck in there."
We should call Rafi and see if he has anything he wants to say.
All you have to do is put an ADR...
"Put an ADR line like, ""Oh, the O'Malley triplets are here tonight."""
- Jeez.
- They're all over the place.
This moment was reshot.
"- Yeah, this was reshot."
- That thing that just happened.
"Oh, yeah."
"Now, Pete, did we use the reshot kiss or the original kiss here?"
- We reshot the kiss.
- The reshot kiss.
"- Okay, because there were a few..."
- Why did you reshoot the kiss?
Because Rafi wasn't handsome enough in the background.
"If you look now, look at the face he makes."
- Not handsome.
- It is stunning.
- Everyone's...
"- I mean, look at that."
The pressure's off.
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?
"All last week, I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest."
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem.
Same names.
Which did not reflect well on their mothers' imagination.
- Mother.
- Mothers.
There were two Clems.
- 'Cause they were brothers.
"- Yes, so they had mothers."
You're drawing me into your drunken world.
"It's not a bad place to be, my friend."
Tank's empty.
- What is this?
- What?
This life plan book thing.
A gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College.
"Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?"
If you can't remember where the living room is.
I'm still good.
"Okay, here's an interesting question for you."
'Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?
'
"They're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure."
"I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock them out... and have nanny catch them and care for them... make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come near them... and then return them to me when they're 21."
What about me?
You are my favorite eldest child.
"So I figured someone cashes it in, you could look at the videotape."
There's our thief.
Yeah.
"Uh, could you excuse me for one moment?"
"Of course, there's no guarantee that the thief would turn it in himself."
You meeting us here is kind of a coincidence.
We were just discussing your case.
"That's a great detection idea, Howard, but I guess we feel like you've been inconvenienced enough."
"So, on behalf of the Montecito, allow me to pay you off on the bet."
- There you go.
There's eighteen hundred.
- Wow.
"And I'll just pull- 2,000."
Thanks.
I-I don't know what to say.
I will definitely recommend your hotel to everyone I know.
That's the guy I played poker with.
And our wallet thief.
And the guy who cost me 240 bucks.
Now it's personal.
Uh-oh.
Better tell the women and children to take cover.
Are you kidding me?
"Seriously, I.R.S. problems?"
Forget about it.
"The I.R.S. is like putty in my hands, honey."
"Really, no worry."
It's putty?
"Stan, what do you know about that guy Roger who played in your poker game the other night?"
"Uh, why don't you call me."
"Uh, not much, you know."
"And I'm really sorry about that whole situation, man, really."
But this money has been accruing interest?
How much money?
TONY:
$327 million and change.
"Boss, I'm seeing multiple attempts to hack into this account over the last week."
It's got to be Amanda Baylor.
Baylor was hired to steal the AUTEC file and this money?
Blackmail was a diversion.
It explains why they never really said anything that hurt us.
"We're watching the AUTEC files, they have a better shot getting in and out of the bank account undetected."
It's all about the Benjamins.
"Well, it looks like Baylor's taking another stab at the account right now."
"She's accessing remotely, and she didn't bother burying her IP so deep this time."
She did not expect us to look for her there.
"Right, I got her."
Getting a Wi-Fi ping.
"Ziva, DiNozzo, go..."
She's just off the I-95.
I'm texting you the coordinates.
Are you sure this is the place?
"Well, what happened?"
"You don't trust the, uh, authority of McMaps?"
(truck horn blows nearby)
(whispering):
All right.
It's like Silence of the Lambs meets Scooby-Doo.
Freeze!
Hands up!
Do I look like I'm running?
"Amanda Baylor, you have the right... (sniffs) to take a bath."
You smell like a wild goat.
I've been busy.
"Left or right, Sir?"
Left.
"Your left or my left, Sir?"
"But sir I came thought here, there are two doors... shall I go through here or there?"
Where is he?
"Brother, Buy a underwear."
I don't want it.
"Buy a underwear, It's awesome."
"I said, I don't want it."
"Buy it, once you wear it you'll become superman."
"Wear it and fly, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and fight, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and climb Kutub Minar, it won't rip off."
Jump off the Kutub Minar your everything will be ripped off but the underwear will stay the same.
This is the guarantee of Laxminarayan.
But your voice will rip my brain off for sure.
Should I write it down?
I already have one.
You have one!
Then you should wear it.
How do you know that I'm not wearing underwear?
You know about my nature.
And this is Laxminarayan Three.
I can tell the topic of letter by looking at the envelope.
I can tell the size of the son by looking at the father.
Wow.
He's been selling undergarments since he didn't even wear undergarment.
He's made a undergarments factory.
Bulbul loungewear.
What is this?
Who are these slim girls?
"Dad, they are our brand models."
- We were miserable together.
"- Yes, I kind of feel that way myself you know, Marie and I."
"See a couple of months ago, we had this big set- to and I moved out for a couple of days."
And I just found that--
I just couldn't imagine being separated.
"But I think I gotta really try to imagine it even with the kids, because we're really unhappy."
I'm not telling you it's easy.
It's not.
I'm not having a great time.
"With you, there were no kids involved."
"That's true, and I do miss her."
"But the interesting thing is, I found out a lot about myself."
"I mean, it doesn't make you happy."
Divorce doesn't make you happy.
"But in a weird way, it's made me eligible to be happy more than I ever have been in my life."
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
"I don't know if that will help you or what, but...."
Yeah.
It helps a lot.
"- Thanks, John."
- Yeah.
[COUGHING ]
You gotten the cold from hell yet?
- Maybe after we've spent time together.
- Let's get through this.
- They'll hit us hard on probable cause.
- Let's do it.
"On October 7, did you have occasion to arrest Julio Ortiz?"
- I did.
COSTAS:
Tell us the circumstances.
"No, there's no time."
"- Listen, I need a favor."
- What?
I need money.
How much money you talking about?
$2 million in cash.
"How about I throw in a Ferrari, man?"
"I'm serious, Isaac."
"Don't matter if you are, I don't have it."
Is there anyone else you know who might have the money?
"Well, ain't nobody got more money than the cops, so try them."
They busted a big heroin deal last week.
I heard they ceased 100 kilos and the money for the buy.
They got $4 million in cash.
"All right, so where would the cops be keeping the money?"
"No, I wasn't being serious."
"Where, Isaac?"
It's at the main precinct on Third.
"It's probably in some evidence lockers, but, look, ain't no way you're getting it out of there."
"Yeah, we'll see about that."
"No, look listen, listen."
"That money is surrounded by a hundred cops, all right?"
All kinds of security down there.
"Isaac, I got no other options, man."
So Nicole was right.
What?
"She, um, said you've been having issues since you got out the army."
That you're not happy.
She told you that?
Yeah.
"She thinks you miss what you was doing over there,"
"All the fighting, killing or whatever."
Go to the market with her.
Very well.
What's so funny?
You're always giggling!
But they're tomatoes!
I suggested we go to the air-conditioned and clean Foodland.
But Aunt had to insist...
"It's not good to buy vegetables from such a dirty place, aunt."
"We have you with us for safety, don't we?"
Would you like some ladyfinger?
"Go and get some bunches of fenugreek from there, aunt."
Why must you need something so bitter?
"Papa loves it, aunt."
Give it to him everyday... and he'll will all his property to you.
If only fenugreek could get his property...
"Two kilos each of potatoes, tomatoes and ladyfinger."
Has Uncle spoken to you?
About what?
"About us, that is..."
Could we have some gourd?
What insolence is this?
!
Was that insolence?
What d'you think you're doing?
"No English, feller!"
You need a slap to rid you of your shamelessness!
Don't mess with him.
Let's move.
He held my hand!
And you talk of going away!
"Talk to me, lady!"
Never mind this chap.
- It was so cold.
She has a funny story about the dance.
I can't remember what it is.
"But, like, it was a dance that they used to do in 8th grade or high school or something."
No.
"You know, what she did was she went back to Tawny Kitaen's choreography in the Whitesnake video."
"- Oh, my God."
- And she copied some of the moves.
"Yeah, because in that video, basically it's Tawny Kitaen dancing on the hood of a Trans Am or something."
- I don't know what it was.
- She looks great.
I mean...
- She modified it for the Yugo.
- She did.
Look at that wind.
That wind doesn't even...
That jacket just goes the other direction.
And they had these huge heater-tunnels things that blew hot air on you.
"It's great because it's so sexy, but so hilarious at the same time."
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so Tris.
"- Cheesy dance, but she looks fantastic."
- It's so painfully cold right now.
Look how cute she is.
What were you thinking when you were watching this take after take?
"I think I was thinking I'd rather be somewhere warm and ""Does she really need me to be here for this?"""
"- Oh, my God."
- Look how cute she...
Look how just...
- She's so adorable.
"- Oh, Mike."
"It looks like there's a wind machine, it's so perfect."
"Well, I haven't slept in days."
Maybe if you just let me get some rest.
I just got kidnapped by space aliens to conduct a freaking top secret science experiment.
You know what we need.
Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle.
I understand what you're asking but come on.
He's doing the best he can.
Do better.
Liana's under a lot of pressure.
"Don't worry, once you crack this, you'll be back home, safe and sound."
What if I can't?
I won't let her harm you.
You have my word.

Adíos.
Allison's in a play this weekend.
- Put the meeting off a couple days.
- You know I can't do that.
Going to school events is what normal parents do.
So you're behind schedule in your research because of PTA meetings?
There is no time to waste!
We've got to get the reversion procedure working!
Mommy?
Allison.
What are you still doing up?
"It's late, honey, you should be asleep by now."
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Fostering human tendencies only confuses her.
"- It's not fair, Ted."
- Let's get you back to bed.
"Making her think she's something she's not, it's not fair to her!"
Déjame verla.
The Army has a new mode of transportation.
Did you hear about it?
Feet.
-Wise guy.
"-Oh, on the double."
"Hey, what's the-- here."
"Formation, on the double, hee-yah, line up."
"Ever-Everybody, look alive!"
"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll only take a minute of your time."
I wish to discuss the motor pool and the work... (chuckling):
Work.
"Now, look, men, I don't ask you to kill yourself, but every once in a while, move a little."
"In case an officer walks by, he won't mistake it for a painting."
"And Zimmerman... didn't get those brake drums on the half-trucks yet, did you?"
"-Well, you know, Sarge..."
"-Oh, I know."
"You've been too busy washing officers' private cars at a buck a throw, right?"
"-Well, Sarge..."
"-Get into those fatigues, down to the motor pool, get those brake drums, and out of here!"
There's been a lot of goofing off going around here.
This has got to stop!
Day sheet in yet?
HENSHAW:
Yo.
"Paparelli, you draw guard duty tonight."
I know.
What's this?
"""Permission-- ten days leave granted to..."""
"Oh, when it comes to asking for a furlough, they're right on the ball."
Let's see which meathead this is.
"""Ten days leave granted to Sergeant Ernest Bilko."""
I got it!
"I'll fix engagement next week as you wish,"
I'll make other arrangements.
"Sister...congratulations, your engagement is fixed next week."
- He ignored me.
- Who?
Who else?
That kick guy!
Bloody idiot!
Is Kalyan here?
When?
Where?
Why are you so excited?
Why did he ignore me?
I am sure he's here to ruin my life.
"It's him, right?"
It's not him...it's not him...
it's him...
I'm sure it's him.
We believe that you'll catch that thief.
You need any help sir?
I need a journalist.
I'm here for my partner.
I'll definitely find him.
"Your interview was rocking, your still in the paper is very glamourous."
You've a good photogenic face.
Have you settled in Malaysia?
How's your accommodation?
"Very good, but weather is hot like you."
"I thought you'd come to marry here, have you come here cracking my clue to catch me?"
"I feel like shaking hands with you, will you give me a chance?"
"Don't rush off buddy,"
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
they find each other and reunite.
I went there every day hoping I'd remember the title.
But you know what?
That scene's not actually from a movie.
huh?
Aren't you gonna get in trouble for hacking into corporate databases and school records?
Little late to be worrying about that!
We're trying to find Takizawa's graduation photo over here!
Got it!
No wonder we couldn't find him!
Freakin' Juiz.
She took everything related to Takizawa Akira on the net and changed it to Iinuma Akira!
what's in No. 09's logs?
There's nothing like that in his...
It's gone!
All evidence of Takizawa Akira's history is being erased!
Even the Seleção logs!
what?
Then they've been erasing the logs when we weren't looking?
Chill out. so I have my PC set up to save a copy of all the logs as they're created.
master!
you're making me blush.
it's like a defense system and attack bot rolled into one!
you ever seen anything like this?
!
bring up Takkun's request details again.
look here.
use their image recognition system.
Pants!
Wha...
Juiz!
Iinuma Akira is going to completely replace Takizawa Akira.
Off your duff Hartley
"One, two."
"One, two."
"""I greatly appreciated the jar of nuts you sent,"" comma..."
"""but would you please show up for your next appointment?"""
"Just sign it, ""Sincerely yours,"" and, you can type it after lunch."
What's the matter?
"I went to Jerry's health club, and I tried to keep up with a 65-year-old woman."
Did you lose any weight?
I don't know.
I'm too sore to get up on the scale.
Ha-ha.
"Listen, Bob."
Do you want another pitcher of water before I go to lunch... or should I just run a hose in here?
"You know, Carol, being on a diet is bad enough without people making fun of it."
"I mean, you probably don't know that."
You've probably never been on a diet.
"In five minutes, I will have been on a diet for seven years."
"You looking forward to your birthday party, Bob?"
"It's not a party, Carol."
"It's, just a small dinner."
"In my case, a very small dinner."
"Oh, listen, Bob."
I wanna ask you something.
Do you think I can have an extra 15 minutes off for lunch?
I have to buy a birthday present for someone.
"Oh, sure."
Take as much time as you want and buy that somebody something real nice.
I certainly will.
"- Well, see you later."
- Right.
- You pressed the button?
Have you checked out their movement?
They're still at the inn.
Will they return to BuYeo?
"If they know who we are, they will not mobilize the fleet so easily."
We will ambush them the moment they are about to leave Heng-In.
We must capture that rascal So Seo-No alive and bring her to me.
Is that understood?
"Yes, Commander."
Miss!
Miss!
What else is there to mull over?
All the workers don't wish to die before they return home.
Please give us the order to withdraw.
"Sa-Yong,"
"Yes, Miss."
"If father were here, what would he do?"
Chief isn't a reckless person.
You think that my frustration is an act of recklessness?
"Judging from our strength, we can't possibly hope to take them on."
We should flee from a battle that we cannot win.
"Actually, I... would have liked to brave the danger to reach Go-San Nation."
Miss!
Father wants to test my competence... through this expedition.
This I am aware of.
That's why I want to give it all I've got.
Please continue.
"But like what Uncle Gye-Pil said,"
I will not put the workers in danger just because of my selfishness.
Prepare to withdraw.
"Miss, I'm glad you said that."
"Hey,"
Just in time.
They'll take care of us really fast
So there's no room for bitching
- Give me a bill
What for do you want a bill?
I'll enter the bank
"Hey, you're learning fast"
"What a way to learn, eh"
Take a good look in there
Look at the cash desk
"The camera, the cashier"
"I want to make a deposit, please"
The window on the right
- Thanks
What do you want?
I want to change this into smaller bills
Here you have
- Thanks
At what time did we agree?
At eight o'clock
It's 8:10 and these guys haven't arrived yet
"Fuck, you just can't trust anyone"
Do I look good?
It's very good
Here they are
Good luck
- See you later
Do you like that one?
That's the one
As much as the 131 is well liked
"Everyone likes that car, eh?"
We'll need another one coming
We can't have that one
I already know?
"Look, Mr. Sandover, I really didn't pay any attention to it after I saw your initials on it and your forwarding slip when you sent it on to the bank."
Let me try to remember.
There may have been some other smaller--
Mr. Sandover?
Get the bags.
"Beth, it's me."
Don't get all excited now.
"I just missed my train, that's all."
But I have something to attend to this evening.
I'm taking the car.
Missed the train?
"But that was hours ago, Sandy."
"For heaven's sake, what happened?"
"I'll explain later, dear."
I'll fly down to Phoenix in the morning instead.
- But Sandy--
"- Look, there's nothing to be alarmed about."
I thought you were going out to dinner with Dorothea this evening.
"Well, yes, but later, so I really wanted to use the car myself, but..."
Oh.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"- Sandy, this is Perry Mason."
- Oh.
"I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Sandover."
Your wife and I are very old friends.
"Yes, of course."
She's always talking about people she used to know when Mr. Devro was alive.
"Sandy, Perry was nice enough to come by on his way home from work to give me some professional advice."
"Oh, all right, Beth, if you're thinking of a divorce, that's no reason to call in such an expensive lawyer."
- Sandy!
- I never handle divorces.

Or what?
"It looks like this, but we aren't stopping there!"
Depleted uranium.
What happens then?
Look here.
I had to do something simpler than dropping a bomb on them.
Like for example put it in grease.
A kind of cream.
But with a very different effect and result.
Here.
For example:
Number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
Exposed to radioactive radiation for several minutes.
With a remarkable result.
Imagine this...
"A larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
Do you understand?
We are what's left!
We are the nation's backbone.
Or to put it like our beloved Führer does:
"""We have so much to answer for, so we MUST win the war!"""
Sunshine?
"Yes, Operation Sunshine."
The protection of power and and dam instalations in Southern Norway.
"Stop the Germans from destroying too much, before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation.
"Poulsson is second in command,   and Skinnarland on radio duties."
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
"By killing Cuddappah Raja for these people, you've kept up your father's promise."
How are you going to save your father who is in Konda Reddy's custody?
I know where my father is.
I will come back with my father.
You leave this place with these people.
Welcome!
Are you Singamuthu's son?
You can't find your father.
Konda Reddy has entered your people's camp.
You don't know about him.
He can knock 3 heads in one swing.
I don't know how many would have died by now.
Your men are going to die there.
And you're going to die here.
Catch him.
Get everyone into the bus.
Leave no child.
Get every child into the bus.
"When we locked up Singamuthu, your boss, everyone worked in fear."
"Now that his son is back, have you lost your fear?"
Get every child into the bus.
"Sir, all are innocent children."
Give us any punishment.
Don't harm them.
"Look, your children will be taken to Bihar or Orissa."
"If anyone tries to escape, we will cut your children's limbs and make them beg on Bombay streets."
Leave my brother.
Tell them to leave my brother.
How will they leave your brother?
You should've thought before doing something.
I told you but you never listened to me.
Now Singamuthu's son beat their men.
Still... we did a lot of good... especially considering we're down a man.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, but I didn't feel like we were down a man, though, the way everybody was pitching in."
It was kind of cool.
"Didn't get Gregorio fired, either."
As far as we know.
(Lasalle laughs)
"Well, we'll finally get back up to speed once Sebastian gets through training."
In the meantime... let's take the day off.
"Now, that works for me."
(chuckles)
"Man, I can just hear that firing range calling my name."
(chuckling):
Geez.
What about you?
I think you know.
Hey.
Think we have enough for an indictment?
"I'll let you know when I get back, but I doubt it."
We are still looking for the smoking gun to directly link Garcia to NOLA businesses.
New Orleans.
New Orleans.
"You really have changed since you've been down here, haven't you?"
How so?
You seem happier... which is a good thing.
"Not for us, maybe, but for you, definitely."
Maybe... you finally have stopped running.
I think so.
"Still, what are you gonna do for work?"
NCIS slot's already filled.
I don't know.
I was thinking I'd try talking Isler into transferring me here.
When Ronny went to jail?
"Before that, when we were out on his boat."
In the storm?
That was fun?
That sucked.
"No, it didn't."
You thought it was exciting.
I wasn't excited.
I was hysterical.
There's a huge difference between hysteria and excitement.
Are we ever gonna have a relationship?
We're having a relationship.
"Here we are, having it."
Ian's got a room at the Chateau.
We'll stay there...
-...you can have the place to yourself.
-You should stay.
"Alex is still looking for an apartment, and we need something permanent so just stay."
Why don't you ask her?
Maybe she wants to be alone in the interim.
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
"I mean, she can't stay away from you as it is."
He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
"No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine and then lock her up."
I think she wants to be locked up.
"Yeah, exactly."
Make your analysis at first  with three general patterns of emotional response.
Rage is the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting.

-I am.
I really am.
You gonna have another?
Is the article ready?
I want to take off for 10 days.
Leave for 10 days?
You people are hopeless!
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!
I'm hungry.
Please help me.
Sorry.
Don't run!
Catch him!
Stop there.
"Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari- Nagercoil highway... a man was found dead after being hit by an unidentified vehicle."
His age is presumed to be about 50.
As we had asked Inspector Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...
A man who was walking on the highway was hit by a vehicle and died on the spot.
The man had no identity card or phone on him.
So we were unable to get his details.
Investigation is going on now.
Those who know any detail about him can approach the Kanyakumari police station.
I'm going to Kanyakumari for an urgent work.
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.
Stop!
Why are you going?
A man was found dead in the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.
"Either we run away from the city,"
Or the whole family...
Why are you so worried after coming to Kanyakumari?
Any problem?
You said wanted to visit police station as well?
Nothing.
There he arrived.
Happy wedding anniversary..
- Thank you PK
His name is PK.
He has recently come from the neighboring planet.
He settled here because of missing his vehicle.
"When all say astrology looking at the palm, my friend says it looking behind the palm."
LOL!
Do you think I am the joker card in a rummy game?
Today morning I saw a piracy CD of PK movie..
I'll tell the original story behind the PK movie..
"When Rajkumar Hirani met him in a bus, he narrated his story to him casually."
He seriously made it into a film.
- I will not believe..
I will make him believe.
Stretch your hands
OK..

This is peaks PK sir.
Do you say what is in pockets just by catching the hands?
Oh my God!
All this looks like a setup.
I do not believe.
Will you believe if I say your hierarchy?
- Tell me.
Stretch your hands.
Your Name:
Maniratnam.
It calms his angry soul.
"You want to ask me about Trina, don't you?"
"No, I just wanted to say sorry for..."
"You loved your wife, didn't you George?"
You were happy?
"Well, we had our moments, but..."
"But yes I did, and um..."
"Yes, we were..."
Yeah.
I loved Trina too.
I don't think she ever really loved me.
Not really.
Deep down inside I always hoped she'd come back.
Even after all this time.
"You were the one who sent the postcards to the kids, weren't you?"
"I know people, plumbers, from all over the world."
"We talk, plumbing, you know, online."
I'd get them to send blank postcards from their country.
I'd copy Trina's bit of scrawl as best I could.
"Christmas cards, birthday messages, love Mummy."
And then I would courier the cards back to my plumbing mates and they'd post them.
I didn't want the kids to think that she'd just left them.
Forgotten them.
"It's bloody stupid, really."
I probably just made things worse.
You were trying to do something good.
We try to make up the loss as best we can.
"Yeah, well sometimes it's just not enough, is it?"
"It gets better, Bill."
"Not every day, but... ..trust me it does."
You hung another one of my paintings.
Yes.
"No, there are 3 more barrels upstairs."
"Nicholai, go and get them."
PROPERTY OF THE US ARMY
"When the American military ordered the canisters destroyed, the authorities here 'followed the instructions'."
"It wasn't until later, that these surfaced in the underground."
and was put here for safe keeping.
It's ironic that it is the American government that wants them.
"Let's get something absolutely clear, the American government has nothing todo with this transaction."
Of course Mr. Garrison.
"Now, how many do you want for your personal use?"
All of them.
Nicholai!
What are you doing?
Excuse me.
Nicholai...
Brains  and we make your favorite snack foods too.
Hybra Tech...
Hey Pyro.
Get moving.
You are going to be late for school.
I am using one of my sick days.
Stop with this!
You're burn the whole house down.
I can start with your room if you like.
"You are having a good old time, aren't you?"
If Mom and Dad was still alive.
But they're not are they?
Why don't you just blow up the whole neighborhood while you are at it?
"Morning, uncle Charlie."
Don't forget to mauld the lawn after school.
Sure.
How was the convention in Bakersfield?
She's got the flu.
- Mm.
"- Yeah, she's got the flu and she didn't want to come, but I begged her."
Uh-huh.
"And she took this cold medicine, and it's knocking her out, but it--it's sweet, actually."
Now can we--or do I gotta keep pretending to enjoy this giant nut-covered ball of cream cheese
Olivia calls an appetizer?
You want me to represent you?
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna make an excuse up as to why you can't be at dinner tonight.
"You're gonna dump the broad, clean up your act, and never, ever come back to my house fucked up again."
You kicking your habit on your own?
That's a slim chance of happening.
"You two doing it together, zero."
That's my offer.
Okay.
[sets drink down]
"Yeah, I just thought of a perfect excuse."
Okay.
"Um, Olivia, we can't make dinner tonight because your husband's a cunt."
"Oh, Nick."
How's that?
You don't know her.
- You don't fucking know me.
- Mm-hmm.
I could throw a rock out your front door and hit nine of you.
You're not special.
You are a by-product of those of us who are!
[comic talking indistinctly onstage]
[Bill and Sully laughing and chatting]
"Yeah, I know you will, you always do."
Oh!
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy had killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.
"Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason."
"You had to have a sit-down, and you better get an okay or you'd be the one who got whacked."
"Saturday night was for wives, but Friday night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends."
"And last week we saw Sammy Davis, Jr."
You got to see this show.
What a performer!
He does these impersonations.
"I swear, you'd think it was the real people!"
"Oh, it's unbelievable."
You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me.
But you could see how some girls could.
Like that Swedish girl.
In other words you condone that stuff?
Take it easy.
I just wanna make sure I don't wind up kissing fuckin' Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
"But, you know, he's got personality."
"""Personality?"""
He's very talented.
I understand perfectly what you're saying.
But you have to watch out sometimes how you say things.
"You know, people get the wrong impression."
I just said he was talented.
Why don't you just leave it alone now?
I don't really have an appetite right now.
I met some people there.
At Ojai.
Like Sarah.
"Mom, do you remember that Christmas, when I was eight and I had my tonsils taken out?"
"And then after the surgery, your friend Bill came by to visit."
And he gave me that doll with the long red hair.
Did Bill really think that a doll could make up for abandoning me?
"What was it, a ""sorry for being a deadbeat dad"" gift?"
No.
Please.
Let me explain.
There's an explanation for why you lied to me for 20 years?
You said that Bill was your friend and left out the part about him being your boyfriend for two decades and my father!
Honey.
"Oh, God."
It is complicated.
"It seems pretty simple to me, Mom."
You were willing to be sloppy seconds for some rich jerk with a wife and kids.
My dad didn't want to fess up to a bastard child with his mistress because he didn't want to risk his Norman Rockwell life.
No.
"I know that you're angry, but you need to hear me through."
Why?
It's too late to do anything about it.
He's dead!
"- Yes, but... but you..."
- How much of it is mine?
What?
The money that William Walker left you.
How much of it is mine?
I put two million dollars in a trust in your name.
And it will be yours when you're 25.
Fascinating.
Good.
Good.
"He knows, doctor."
He has reasoned it out.
Yes.
- Yes.
"- What is it, Spock?"
"An invention, doctor."
"First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal."
What's he doing?
"Diamonds, the hardest known substance."
"Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles."
What force?
"Recall your basic chemistry, doctor."
- Gunpowder.
"- Captain, let us be reasonable."
You have lost.
Admit it to yourself.
Stop running.
Coal.
Can he do it?
"If he has the time, doctor."
If he has the time.
No.
"No, I won't kill you."
Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.
"No, I won't kill him!"
Do you hear?
You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else.
You're a Metron?
"Does my appearance surprise you, captain?"
It's heavily reinforced.
It's pressurising.
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
After you.
REED:
"A little stale, but breathable."
Bio-signs... very faint.
REED:
Coming from in here.
[Solemn instrumental music]
Some kind of shuttlecraft?
ARCHER:
More like an assault vehicle.
"I'm reading a half-dozen particle-cannons, torpedo launchers."
[Radio beeps]
Archer.
"TRIP: [On radio] You'd better get over here, sir."
T'POL:
The DNA is identical to the bodies we found.
They would appear to be the crew's offspring.
A hatchery?
They built this place to take quite a beating.
"Reinforced bulkheads, backup power systems."
Thirty-one eggs are still viable.
They won't survive for long.
Their bio-support is losing power.
Do you think you can repair it?
I wouldn't even know where to start.
"There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay, get it back to the ship."
I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
"Aye, sir."
ARCHER:
He never mentioned trouble at work.
- You think there could be a connection?
- Could be.
"You hear ""A.T.F. investigation,"" it raises flags."
"Well, I wish I could be more helpful."
Sorry.
You should just focus on getting your son back.It's the best way to deal with it.
"Evelyn, I think you're stronger than you realize."
Then maybe I should have just stuck with it.
"You know, what would have happened if- if I had have pretended that everything was all right?"
"But I didn't want my family to be a lie- not forJasper, not for me."
You're doing the best thing.
Believe me.
I know a little something about this.
"I've stayed, and I've left, and sometimes leaving is what you have to do."
"Must be lonely, what you do."
- I couldn't live that way.
- In my line of work...
I can't allow myself to get too close.
What if you met someone?
There's a spark.
Would you ignore it?
Could you?
"I would, uh... concentrate on getting the job done."
I gotta head over to Doug's.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Okay.
"What's taking so long, Sam?"
You losing your touch?
I didn't know Doug would have a nine-pin dimple lock.
"You know, the new kind- the kind I haven't practiced on."
"Okay, my fingers are bleeding now."
Another one ofmy favorite leading men was Howard Keel.
"Best known for his rich baritone voice, he had a very competitive romance with Betty Hutton in Annie Get Your Gun."
"- No, you're not"
"- Yes, I am"
"- No, you're not"
"- Yes, I am, yes, I am"
I can shoot a partridge With a single cartridge
I can get a sparrow With a bow and arrow
I can live on bread and cheese
- And only on that?
- Yes
- So can a rat
"- Any note you can reach, I can go higher"
- I can sing anything higher than you
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can"
"- No, you can't"
"Yes, I can"
"Anything you can wear, I can wear better"
In what you wear I'd look better than you
- In my coat?
- In your vest
- In my shoes?
- In your hat
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can, yes, I can"
"Anything you can say, I can say faster"
I can say anything faster than you
"- No, you can't"
"- Yes, I can"
- I can jump a hurdle
- I can wear a girdle
and contusion on the arm.
"Look, this is an arm... the contusion, commonly called a bruise, is this big."
"So, in my opinion, she suffered a violent blow."
"Maybe she fell, I don't know."
Is it possible that she got into a fight?
She didn't say?
No she didn't talk about that.
"Mind you, she told me that... at some point she got up, she went to the window... and that's when she saw... the lady in question, on the ground."
"She would have also seen a young black man running, running..."
Did she say anything else?
I'm trying to see...
It's not my field...
"No, that's about it."
"Then, another blackout."
Any idea as to when we could interrogate her?
Not before 3 days.
3 days?
"3 full days, if not more."
Maybe you can get ahead with your investigation.
There might be other leads...
"Yes, thank you."
We'II follow other leads.
"- Thank you, doctor."
- alright.
"unfortunately, I must go to the clinic, but if you need me for anything..."
- Don't hesitate.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
"well, we'II take care of you guys."
alright... where do we do this?
"We could go in there, there are doors."
We'II get back to you shortly.
"Corporal Barbella, you're a dreamer."
"Now, look, you guys, you got to get on the ball."
You understand?
I want guys that want to soldier.
"You soldier for me,"
I'll interfere with the old man for you.
I-I...
What is that?
I cannot...
You making faces behind me?
What are you doing?
"Now, look, if you guy..."
"You know, Sergeant, some of the officers paid me for washing their car, and I figured if you're still running the snack-in-the-sack raffle, can I have a couple of shots at it?"
-(overlapping chatter)
"-Me, too."
"Yeah, me, too, Sarge."
Two tickets for the next dance.
-Put me down for the motor pool.
-Two tickets.
"All right, is this the suite?"
"Yes, sir, the adjoining room is right through there."
Is that all the flowers they got up here?
"-Oh, I'll get some more, sir."
"-Oh, never mind, we'll rough it."
"Hello, get me the main desk."
"All right, get that champagne spread out, get those cigars laid out..."
"Hello, main desk."
"Uh, look, there may be some poor souls wandering around the lobby looking for Squad ""B"" reunion-- ""B,"" ""B"" like in ""Bilko,"" yeah."
"-Send 'em up to suite, uh..."
-BELLHOP: 32C.
"32C on the double, look alive, hey... all right, good-bye!"
-You got the champagne out there?
- He wouldn't have been pleased.
- Of course not.
He didn't like revolutions.
"Still, he was like a brother to me."
"We always liked the same women, but never the same politicians."
At least you don't take after anyone in your family.
That was excellent.
My compliments!
The worst is over.
"One more day, and who knows what would have happened."
I think you'll be able to get up again in a week's time.
"Give him some more morphine in an hour, but be careful with the dose."
Wait a minute.
Can't I do that myself?
Don't be silly.
I've been working in hospitals for 20 years.
I've seen worse things.
"Thanks, Pablito."
I don't believe it!
You should know you can't smoke in a hospital.
I'll go and relieve Getullio now.
I don't think there'll be any trouble here for a while.
You deserve a drink.
"Don't worry, it's not Communion wine."
Cheers.
"It's strong, isn't it?"
The Campesinos distil it illegally.
- Aren't priests banned from drinking this?
"- Yes, but some do worse things."
- When will this insanity be over?
- When we've succeeded.
"I'm really not opposed to your revolution, Mariá, but what makes me sad is that you use the same violence as them."
Wise guy!
"- Hey, wait!"
- You talkin' to me?
Hold on a minute.
What's your big hurry?
- What do you want?
- Nuthin'.
Just got a question.
"Now, then... where are you going?"
To work.
Work's hard to find these days.
I know some work for a guy with your muscles.
I don't use muscle anymore.
I use... my kisser!
"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen."
Come closer.
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"Step right up, folks."
"You too, young lady with your husband, and you minors too."
Why don't workers wear ties?
Because they can't tie 'em!
"So he buys a tie holder but it's poor quality, and he can't tie his tie!"
That's cheating the customer!
That's a swindle!
That makes people resentful and pushes Germany even deeper into misery than it already is!
"Come closer, folks."
You storm troopers are kindly invited to join the festivities too.
Step in closer so I can save my voice.
I didn't insure it.
I couldn't make the first payment.
Buy my handy little ready-made gadget here.
You'll save time and money.
If I'm going to be somebody's plaything why not work at a dancing house and earn a bit more money to send home
"Congratulations, sir"
You have the look of a rich man
You'll be rich in 2 years' time lf this doesn't come true you can come and challenge me
"Miss, your id please"
"Duke, do you have an id card?"
Give me back my id card
Thank you
"Miss, please come over"
"My dear, where have you been?"
Go back to your sleep
"Go, it's late"
"Duke, show me your id card"
My wife
"Honey, wait for me, don't go so fast idiot"
I must thank you for what you just did
You've saved me once
You have no id card?
Did you swim here?
Jumped the train?
I swam here
How long have you been here?
Not too long
What's your plan?
What plan can I have?
Staying with your relatives?
Washing clothes?
Yes
Did you come from the mainland?
Have you got any relatives here in Hong Kong?
Virtually none
Please don't mind my saying lt's not a good idea to stay with that gang
"You're such a nice man, and I actually did have a great time the other night, but I'm just not looking for a relationship right now."
"I mean, the... the truth is, I haven't had sex in three years."
Really?
You wouldn't know it the way you jumped right back in with the dirty talk.
"Okay, no, look, Stan, listen, you are my one under the belt, okay, a fling, all right?"
"But it's over, it's finished."
Wow.
That's too bad.
'Cause I really like you.
You're so foxy and nice.
I even... made you this mix tape.
Oh.
You remembered my favorite band is Supertramp.
"Well, I slept with him again."
"And it was even worse this time, because he made me feel so self-conscious about the dirty talk."
Hi.
"I'm your brother, and I think you remember your ex-husband, Richard."
"Yeah, Matthew was just filling me in."
He didn't mention the dirty talk.
I didn't even know about the dirty talk.
Now I got to go call Mom back.
Don't!
Don't!
I can't believe Matthew told you.
Don't blame Matthew.
I already heard about it.
It's all over school.
The fourth graders are doing their class project on it.
Christine... what are you doing?
I don't know.
"It was our conversation the other day, okay?"
"You're right, I haven't had sex in three years, you know?"
- Right.
- Grant would have slapped your face.
- He did once.
"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and, Mr. Vice President, I couldn't care less."
- But what about the campaign?
- What about it?
- President just got past an honesty issue.
- He's not past it.
- If it becomes public...
- That's a big assumption.
"No, it's not."
I think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done talking about the ticket.
The president wants the vice president to remain the vice president and he wrote down his one and only reason.
"""Because I could die."""
"Well, of course, he's right, sir."
It doesn't solve the problem of the electoral math.
I don't know what the field will look like after Labor Day.
"It'll be shaken up, but right now the math's tough."
"And I know you all think he's a punch line, and I know why."
But I disagree.
They're sure running the right guy against us.
Am I the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler and a hockey goal might get the job done?
I don't know.
I'm open to new ideas.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
- You need to have an injection?
- Yes.
The gentleman needs to have an injection.
"Ah, the gentleman needs to have an injection?"
The gentleman needs to have an injection.
"If I understand correctly, the gentleman needs to have an injection."
"- Yes, that's right."
- Very good!
"Come with us, we'll take care of it."
"Don't worry, you won't feel any pain."
"Alright, come in."
"- That's it, don't worry."
- Bend over.
Now stay right there... brace yourself.
A little to the side... that's it.
Get comfortable.
Uncover your rear.
- Your ass.
- Relax your muscles!
"Relax, you'll receive an unforgettable injection."
"That's it, don't move... remain still..."
"Good, his test results, they're not the best."
- Give me the X-ray.
"- Right away, Professor."
No wonder...
It's quite clear.
"Tomorrow we'll make a small intervention,   which will definitely fix it."
Happy?
"Cicchirini, take charge of the preparations."
"Leave it to me, Professor."
"- Oh, Professor!"
"- Will you let me by, Miss?"
Stay here!
I'll be right back.
Are you not feeling well?
- I'm just waiting for someone.
Thanks a lot.
- Excuse me please...
Did you get her rid of her so soon?
Who am I supposed to have gotten rid of?
I've been sleeping here!
This caring is touching!
Did you not see Hassenreuter's costumes down below?
"I figured that I'd stay guard here, so that nothing is stolen."
And then you open up a chest without any authorization and take its contents out?
Should I sleep on the mattress?
"No, Bruno, that you shouldn't do!"
You need a soft pillow for your conscience to let you sleep.
Do you also sleep in your nightdress?
You piece of crap!
"If it weren't for your sister,"
I'd break every bone in your body!
You're not worthy of her blind adoration...
Here!
You can return the rags of those dames with whom you've been sinning!
"If you would at least admit to it, but no..."
You're a coward and you lie...
Lie...
"Whoever lies, steals and whoever steals..."
"No, I'll mess up the baptism..."
You hang yourself alone.
Old fool!
Now then...
Father of the child?
But it's not like I enjoy it!
My guess is that his bitching is just for show
Don't say that.
I'm pretty scared
"Oh, you're scared?"
Yeah...
It's like I feel this overwhelming power
"Yeah, that makes sense"
So then the two of you are normal
"Yes, other than the fact that I want a penis I think I'm super normal"
What does that mean?
I just wanna be a top
With Lin bottoming?
I used to want that but not too much recently
He was really cute back in middle school
You two have been together for so long
We aren't dating
That's not what...
I'm not interested in dating right now
"I don't mean Lin only, but men in general"
I'm just not interested
What I am interested in now is puttin Lin's hard penis inside Bebi's anal
So kinky
That's so kinky
Stop it Big Sis
Lin is gonna fuck me?
It's Ok.
"Come on Sis, don't!"
"Sorry, I need to go to the bathroom"
He's coming on to you
"Big Sis, you're getting too excited"
"Yep, my sparkly index is at 200%"
For your signature.
"Yes, the pipeline deal."
"Well, I'll just have to look these over and then I'll sign them."
So you and Claudia got married.
Blake doesn't approve.
I hope you do.
"Oh, there's bound to be friction between you and your brother."
I feel no animosity toward Steven.
"If there are any problems, they won't be of my making."
"Adam, I want you to make this marriage work."
"And if that sounds like an order, it is."
Steven.
I heard you were here.
I thought you might like these copies I had made.
What are they?
Papers on the pipeline deal.
Mother signed them a little while ago.
Thanks.
"What else brings you here, Adam?"
Frankly?
"Something's been bothering me, Steven."
"A lack in you, let's say."
What kind of a lack?
You've never congratulated me on my marriage to Claudia.
What's the matter?
Don't you approve?
It's not for me to approve or disapprove.
"Well, surely, you must have some opinions, Steven."
"I mean, you did abandon Claudia to run off with your boyfriend."
"His name was Luke, and he's dead."
And I don't want you to talk to me about him with anything but respect.
You understand?
Why don't you ask me to come to your place?
I'm asking myself the same.
I can assure you I'm not calling for nothing.
Then put me with the asylum's principal.
"Alright, with the housemother then."
Good evening.
I was trying to explain to the other Mrs. the matter of my call.
"But apparently, there's a strong discipline in not letting an adult lady, who's there by her own will, answer the phone."
I'm not trying to teach you anything.
But...
I don't see the necessity in imposing...
military rules to some peaceful old people.
The problem is this:
It turns out that Jacoba... left home leaving a note in which she wrote me where she was going.
Without any apparent reason.
Please note that I'm disconcerted.
Jacoba's been at home for more than 40 years.
I don't know.
I can't remember her last name.
Good morning.
Did you make all this by yourself?
Of course.
And where did you get the jam and the toasts?
Everything was in the house.
And the cups?
They're yours.
Where were they?
There.
They'd only be used for special occasions.
"Like today, for example."
"God, they're tasty."
Don't laugh.
This Thanksgiving is gonna be the worst!
You don't know that.
"The years my dad comes are great, and my mom years are disasters."
You should really try to appreciate the time you have with your mom.
Spoken like a man who drove his mother all the way to Oregon and enjoyed it.
"Well, our book club had just ended, and the last three books were set in the Pacific Northwest."
It just made sense.
I just want a peaceful Thanksgiving.
I have nothing to be thankful for!
Your three beautiful children are right here.
"Called to school by Dr. Ellie... great Special Ed teacher, terrible necklace-chooser."
Anna-Kat's behavior has been a little heightened lately.
She organized the stuffed animals by fur color.
Looks a little race-war-y.
Is anything going on at home?
Any changes?
"Well, her favorite toy pony, Frenchie..."
"Oh, I know about Frenchie's leg."
Mm.
Anything else out of the ordinary?
"Uh, the holidays can be stressful for parents, and sensitive kids can pick up on that."
My mother.
She's coming for Thanksgiving.
Ahh.
I-Is that complicated for you?
No.
It's pretty simple.
She's the worst.
My mom's the biggest narcissist on the planet.
She was a Pan Am stewardess back in the day when it meant something.
But was she there for me growing up?
No.
Let's get out of here.
We're gonna draw a crowd.
Just don't lie there.
Get 'em!
Wait.
Higgins.
Wait.
Easy.
Better?
A little trick I learned in Shanghai just after the war... from a sturdy little Oriental chap who demonstrated using dogs.
"Actually, it's still pretty bad."
I think I may be out of action for several days.
- No swimming with this.
- Perhaps a little acupuncture.
Let me just get my needles and we'll try some simple muscle testing.
"On the other hand, activity could be good for circulation."
Let's go back to the guesthouse.
"I'll give you hot packs, alternating with cold packs."
No.
Not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- You mean?
"- Yes, as a matter of fact."
The Hardy Boys out there.
Especially the one with Roger's teeth.
I was just gonna tell you about that.
You were just so busy with beauty and pain that it slipped your mind.
Roger doesn't have any gold teeth.
"Well, these two guys came to see me in Bayonne about six weeks ago."
Looking for Roger.
What story did they give you?
Even at the exercise salon it sounded phony.
"You know, jim, i'm just crazy enough to go with you, but how are we going to get back across that line?"
"You-all know, folks, i'm on my way to savannah, georgia, to join my regiment, and i'm giving my good english friend here, sir nicholas boyd, safe conduct."
"Ah, yes, of course."
"And i'm buying cotton for dear old england, eh, what?"
You sure is.
"You sure is making me mighty nervous, you sure is."
You-all's price is right with me.
I'll take your whole doggone crop.
"I say, fraser, you better move all this cotton onto the dock immediately and make some bally room for the 200 bales coming in in the morning."
"Perkins, go up to the stonington railroad, tell them to run 20 freight cars onto our dock before 3:00."
We're gonna put a lot of money in the bank today for jim and nick.
Do you smell it?
What?
New england.
We're home again.
Jim!
Nick!
"Oh, hello, nick!"
Luke!
"Oh, jim."
"Gee, you haven't changed a bit."
Neither have you.
"My, you're a sight for sore eyes."
Our general manager.
"Gee, jim, i'm so happy."
"I can't wait, i've got a bet on with jim."
Tell me-what were the total profits on all that cotton we shipped up here?
"$821,000.46 in gold."
821 thou?
"Why, that's 100,000 more than we expected."
How did you do it?
Luke- you're the eighth wonder of the world.
The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
"- Page me with the result, okay?"
"- Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss."
"Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon."
"The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff."
Keep me apprised of his condition.
"- Okay, the last one."
- Can I go see him now?
No.
We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
- They' re not doing anything.
- Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
"Six days a week, 10 hours a day."
Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They' re really happy though.
"I mean, she's lucky to have him."
- He's a good man.
- Luka no fragments in the x-ray.
Ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Put Polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed-off.
So.
"You're just here to help me get information about Gus Walker, huh?"
That's right.
"Glass of Chardonnay for the lady, please."
Thanks.
"Come on, Jack."
You don't have any new information for me.
You just want to get to Walker's files to see if there's anything in there about your friend Fredel.
Not gonna work.
Come on.
Can't a guy do two things at once?
I liked Gus.
"You know, he was a major talent."
Agreed.
"The tragedy of this thing is that he lived in fear because of how controversial his work was, but this last series wasn't political at all."
So you followed his career.
Even after you stopped working for him?
"I'm not nearly as... one-dimensional as you think I am,"
Special Agent Henson.
"Oh, is that right?"
"You know, that's what Walker was trying to say with these photos."
It was about the way we perceive one another.
An issue that you are sensitive about.
Maybe.
Are you?
"You're wasting my time, Jack."
"I mean, what'd you do?"
Run an Internet search on the guy or something?
I'm interested in his work.
Uh-huh.
[dialing cell phone]
"Let's talk about this latest series, right?"
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
Also I don't like fireeaters.
And I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"I mean, you wouldn't let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
- Say some things you don't like.
"- Shut up, Calum."
I'm bored.
"Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
It makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
That's the undercover's wife.
Caroline Risdale.
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her.
But there's only one thing that comes before a lady.
My dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
?
"I'll get us something to eat, then we'll start working in shifts."
Why?
"Because if we don't, I'm gonna start garroting you myself."
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
What kind of bag?
- Officer.
- Come on.
"Let's go, will you?"
"No, wait a minute."
What seems to be the trouble?
"Good morning, sir."
"Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse."
Make him give it back.
"Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters?"
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.
"Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace."
"But, Officer, he took my..."
That'll be enough.
"Run along now, you're obstructing traffic."
"Why, you Cossack."
"Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way."
I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is.
"Not at all, but..."
"Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames."
"That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong."
So now I'm wrong.
You ought to thank me for what I've done.
"- All right, thank you."
- All right.
What did you say?
"I said, look out for the great big ditch."
"Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?"
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.
"He'd enlisted October 11,1943."
Whatever jam he'd got in must have been just before that.
It might have made the papers.
"There it was, Father."
All over page one.
Only five weeks before Johnny enlisted under the name of Drake.
The rest was what you'd expect.
Nationwide search.
A murder indictment.
Search for Johnny goes limp.
Story dribbling off until it fell out of the paper.
The newspaper gave me answers but there were three things I had to find out.:
How could Johnny be a murderer?
Why come back here where he was hotter than the weather?
And why?
Why not another word from him since that first call?
"Listen, honey."
Haven't you got any radio news programs in this city?
All I get is commercials and a lot of that apple pan dowdy.
Not until 12:00?
"Well, thank you kindly, ma'am."
I thought I'd turned the juice off.
But I'd flipped it to the police call band.
Car 42 reporting in.
Car 42 reporting in.
Broken railing on Tarpon Springs Turnpike was due to auto smash.
A burned sedan.
"Body, charred beyond identification."
Been there two days.
Send morgue wagon.
- Car 42 reporting.
Got it?
"It is teaching about wow a state should be, how it should be managed"
Italian?
Italian
I want to learn all of these
You should learn the langauge to understand these
İbrahim Paşa will teach you Italian and Latin as much as he has time
Our prince's desire for knowledge will enthuse him
I want to learn too Paşa.
Come on show me
"My prince, you will grow up a little."
I'll teach you when you grow
"You are a strong man, Matrakçı."
You won again
I guess you didn't sleep last night.
You are still not awake
You should be tired
I don't mind such tiredness
But tonight we should see Elenica again
Her food was very delicious
Good
Cheer up Matrakçı
A problem shared is a problem halved
Bey?
Where to?
"Come on, let's talk"
"Stay out of my way, don't get close"
"Don't show coyness, come here"
Don't touch me!
Hey!
I'm Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey
Are you okay?
It is not your business
"Amy, you are going to love the kitchen, but first I'm going to show you guys the living room."
It has a wall-mounted flat screen and a gas log fireplace.
You won't believe how easy this is.
One push of a button...
Isn't that cozy?
"Make sure you capture the back of his head, too."
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.
-Sorry.
- Sorry.
"There's no rush, gentlemen."
Our patient isn't going anywhere.
"I don't know, Ducky, the old Gibbs is back."
The old Gibbs?
"McGee, over here."
Hands and knees.
On the floor.
"Okay, um..."
"You're not going to step on me, are you?"
Footprints.
It's a pretty tight weave.
Looks like sisal.
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven from the leaf of a cactus plant.
"It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static."
Makes it ideal for carpeting.
"Personally, I prefer a good shag."
From a criminal-investigative standpoint.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me, boss."
"Oh, the coffee."
Ran the military ID our local LEO's got off the body.
That's the most conceited statement.
"But if she starts to interrupt, he shrinks her back and puts her away."
I understand.
"What you're saying is, women are made to be loved."
- ls that what I'm saying?
"- lt's a confession that a woman may drive you crazy, but you wouldn't trust her."
"And because you couldn't put her in your pocket, you'd get mix ed up."
I don't understand what does it.
What did it f or Johnny?
"The trouble is, it happened to Johnny but it didn't happen to me."
- At least not as intensely.
- That's what he was af raid of.
I was going with him because he was the nicest person I'd ever met.
And I'm lonely.
You're right about women being made f or love.
But what happens when it never comes the way you want it?
Like music that never reaches a pitch?
"What do you do, go on singing songs and drinking Ramos gin fizzes?"
Yeah I can see why Johnny loved you.
- And why he couldn't reach you.
"- l loved him, Rip."
It's just....
There's some people you feel you can talk to.
"They come along, they sit beside you in your car."
"Only, the f unny thing is, it's never happened bef ore."
- That's crazy to say.
- You're the one that's mix ed up.
- But I'm not mix ed up.
- Get back in my pocket.
"Do me a f avour, park it f or a while."
I'd like to be alone with the lady.
"Caref ul, I'm the marrying type."
Too busy for personal hygiene?
"When I am focused, I am focused."
"You know, McGee like them gamey, but I'm not sure he'd go for this one."
"Oh, I clean up nice."
Why don't you put the computer down and step out here?
"Let's go, Animal Kingdom."
Come on.
"So, who are you working with?"
"Ah, um..."
I don't know.
"Well, we know some stuff about the blackmail and about the AUTEC account."
We also know that you're in cahoots with someone inside Wickes Steel.
Um...
Did you just use the word cahoots?
I did.
Nice.
"All right, somebody hired me, through Wickes, but, uh, I don't have a name."
Didn't want one.
Was it Ridgeway?
Did you kill him?
I don't kill people.
I hack.
I haven't really left the van.
No kidding.
"Next time, hacker, why don't you crack a window?"
This is all of Baylor's computer hardware.
No sign of the rifle used to shoot Ridgeway in her van or in the apartment.
"Abby, you do know that AUTEC is just a facility where they run tests, right?"
"No, Tim, it is a potluck of the unexplained, and this scientist is eating it up; you know why?"
Because there's a lot of really important things that can't be explained.
"Like what, Abbs?"
Like Atlantis.
except you who are a badass.
DICAPRIO:
"You hunt and fish here, right?"
AWA:
Yeah.
DICAPRIO:
"What do you, what do you fish and what do you hunt?"
AWA:
"In my territory I hunt fish, seal, narwhal, and polar bear."
DICAPRIO:
Is this polar bear?
AWA:
Yup.
DICAPRIO:
"Oh, well there you go!"
"And the ice here, since you've been around has it been decreasing?"
AWA:
"We used to have a solid ice, blue."
"Not light blue like this, blue."
"Hard, ice."
"Now we usually have a, kind of ice cream type of ice."
"It's ice but it's, when it starts to melt, it melts pretty fast."
Much faster than before.
"DR. SALA: 2040, you will be able to sail over the North Pole."
There's going to be no sea ice left in the Arctic Ocean in the summer.
We are burning so many fossil fuels that the ice is melting.
The Arctic is like the air conditioning for the Northern Hemisphere.
"If it goes away, that's going to change currents, that's going to change weather patterns, that's going to make floods and droughts more catastrophic."
It's the most dramatic transformation of a large environment ever.
Look at this.
DICAPRIO:
They're right here!
Sorry.
I had a little bit of a kitchen accident.
"I was trying to get an avocado pit out, and I did the stab method instead of the chop."
- Took off like half my--
- Ahem!
...but I'm good to go.
I know.
I'm here.
"I'm here, you're here."
"Let's do this, right?"
So I am Patty Solis-Papagian.
I represent Jason Larson.
"So two years ago,"
"Ryan Larson, father of Jason, employee of Borns Tech, blew up on a boat owned by the defendant."
What was he doing on the boat?
"Well, he was dumping explosives into the ocean."
Completely illegal.
"Now, what were these explosives that he was dumping?"
"Well, they were parts of an illegal weapon that was being made by Borns Tech."
Get this: we have video of the explosion.
"Not only do we have video, we have the blueprints and the model of the weapon."
We found them buried in his backyard.
Guy had them buried in his backyard.
"At the end of the day,"
Borns Tech is no good.
- [clicking]
"- They're just no good because they do dangerous things with hazardous materials, and they don't care who it affects."
They could care less.
And this is a trend that happens with big corporations all the time.
Your Honor?
"Ford with the Pinto,"
"Big Tobacco, NFL with the--"
- Gordi.
- And Toe.
"Guys, time to put on a foil."
"Play some old-time hockey, like Eddie Shore."
- Dit Clapper.
- And Toe Blake.
- And Gordie Howe.
- Gordie.
"- You all right, goalkeep?"
"- Riley, you okay?"
"Hell, no."
"Look here, you okay?"
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Great!
Good!
Get him again!
This is how you get the jersey over your opponent's head.
"Today, if they have the balls to show up, the Newman boys face the much-hated Scranton Night Hawks."
"Two-time runners up for the Hounds, the Hawks are reloaded and they are as tough as they got."
"Holy smoke, the Newman team takes to the ice in a manner that can only be termed tremendously tacky."
They have donned the sacred shrouds of the Chiefs.
This is a sacrilege.
"Yeah, tacky like that time when you got sloshed on communion wine."
"Well, yes, exactly like that."
"0-1, same old butt-whopping."
It is clear these Newman boys are decidedly doing disservice to the lasting legacy of the Chiefs.
"Hey, Riley, I think it's time."
"Toe, Dit, Gordi, let's do it!"
"Okay, boys, make your daddies proud."
"Talk about their family ties, sports fans."
It appears the offspring of the Hanson brothers are making their first appearance as part of this ragtag team.
"My life is stupid, useless, and when you read this letter,"
I'll be dead by poison.
I write you to make it clear I'm the only one responsible for my death.
Nobody should be blamed for my death.
Nobody.
Farewell.
"Baroness de Vibray."""
Fantastic!
"You are a brother, Arsène."
Usher!
Procurator asks for me.
I gotta go.
You would get me a permit to enter in the jail?
What would I not do?
Judge Fuselier is committed to the case.
See you later.
You do not monitor the prisoners to prevent these things?
"Listen, after we took his fingerprints, everything was fine."
"At midnight, the guard made his round and found nothing unusual."
Only this morning he was found hanging.
When soup was being served.
Hanging?
And with what?
"I see what you're getting at, Mr Fandor."
But no.
"The guards removed his tie, his suspenders and his shoelaces."
All that was left him was a medallion
which he held dear.
"You know, the unfortunate man had to exert a terrible energy, because he tied strips of his shirt to the bars of his window and he hung himself leaning back in the rear."
"Tell me, death was probably very slow?"
Could I see him?
Why not photograph him?
What are they lugging now?
Steamed cake!
We were supposed to kill this boy
Is this a store room or a mortuary?
"Sir, Principal and ISO officers are coming here to inspect"
I was asked to tell you to keep the students here even if the bell goes
- Even after the bell rings?
"- Yes, sir"
Who is this?
For 3 days no time to even breathe 1 minute
Time to ring the bell
Let me ring the bell
What happened?
You fainted on that day after you drank juice?
- When?
- On Sports day
"Yes, why?"
Who gave you that juice?
My name?
Then this book should also have more copies
NSS students gave me
Who told them to distribute the juice?
I don't remember now
"- Forgot, Shiva"
- Think...think
Then?
KS sir had arranged it on the table
What are you doing here when Inspection is going on?
In the absence of a teacher don't you know it is wrong to access the computer?
"I know, sir"
"Why are you not in class, sir?"
You've changed your shirt too
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You have to pay attention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad, but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff."
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger."
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me you only honka'd me?
I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"Thanks, baby."
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
Mm.
"I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted."
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
"And wait, you-you forgive me?"
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple ""cee-gars."""
Get over here!
All right.
"So, where are those ""cee-gars""?"
"Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute."
"Hey, Barn."
Ted?
"Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
I was a better teacher because of you.
- Fresh pepper?
"- Not for her, but I'll have some."
Could you bring her a side dish of dressing?
She likes a little extra.
I feel I should return the favors.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'll have to think about that.
Just glop it on.
Enjoy your dinner.
- You're not eating.
"- No, I'm watching your ritual."
"I just about got your sequence now, I think."
"You start by rotating the plate counterclockwise, cut on the diagonal, remove unwanted elements, and now comes my favorite part, the loading of the fork."
"It's fascinating, the percentages you use of different vegetables to create that one harmoniously balanced, perfect bite."
Mmm.
You have a little...
Don't smear it.
That might stain.
You might want to put a little soap on that.
I'll be right back.
Mmm.
I want to ask you something.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not a machine.
"We both have overwhelming feelings for each other, don't we?"
- You're doing great.
Keep it up.
- Okay.
Ready?
- Doesn't that music infuriate you?
"- Yeah, I'm livid."
"He came down here Monday morning, asking for something to match his skin tone."
He didn't tell me what it was for.
"Well, we just left him."
His hands are pale.
"His face is, uh... tan."
- Which tone were you trying to match?
- More tan.
And he wanted it waterproof.
Waterproof to cover a wound?
Maybe it's not for nothing he's wearing a turtleneck.
We need to find someone who's seen him without his shirt on.
Unless you wanna take a shvitz with him.
They don't pay me enough.
So you do Gillian Booth's makeup?
- She always looks so radiant.
"- Oh, thanks."
Sad to think of her alone at a time like this.
The maestro must be a big help.
I know he was in her dressing room Sunday night.
Philip was the first friend I called.
He came right away.
"So Philip's a special friend, isn't he?"
Did he spend the night with you?
"Well, it's only natural that you wouldn't want to be alone with your grief, right?"
"Well, if that's what you mean... yes."
He held me while I cried.
We fell asleep.
Did you happen to notice if he had any wounds or scratches?
On him?
"What, you think we were naked?"
"I might have been very vulnerable, but Philip is no cretin."
All he did was encourage me to talk about Laura.
- Things don't end this suddenly.
"- Yes, they do."
"No, they don't."
"Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over."
"We'll go on Saturday, then."
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
"Pedro Paulo, my darling."
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
"Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet."
"Technically speaking, I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it."
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does thejapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
"There are no ""strange acts"" for people with open minds."
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
"What do you mean ""these guys""?"
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
- They go quicker than The mail On Sunday.
- Any chance of using the little girls' room?
"Oh, er, top of the stairs, first right."
"Mind if I come, too, hilly, love?"
"- What are you doing here, Pam?"
- Just welcoming the new girl.
"Oh, I thought you had Weight Watchers on Tuesday morning."
"And to think, you were worried about making friends."
Oh!
Uh.
There just seems to be so much more community spirit here.
"- Everything OK up there, ladies?"
"- (Choking) Fine, thanks, Jerry."
- Joyce won't be joining you.
- CamiIIa says otherwise.
I don't give a fuck what your handler thinks.
So take your basket of shit and go back to your kennel.
- Likewise.
- Oh!
"Now, if any of your crew so much as fart in the same room as Joyce, we'II turn the lot of you into organic mince."
Nice big airing cupboard you've got up there.
Is Pam OK?
pelvic floor gave up the ghost after baby number five.
Didn't manage to make it to the bathroom.
- Oh.
- Sends her apologies.
"Oh, you poor love."
I know how fond you are of that trouser suit.
Margaret.
I thought I couId show you round little Stempington.
I haven't really started unpacking.
There's someone I'm dying for you to meet.
The bank doesn't encourage people to keep cash in safe deposit boxes.
She spoke to you about keeping money here?
No.
We never talked about it.
Who else besides you would have access to this box?
Any officer.
"You'd have to have the customer's key or the master, like I used."
What are you thinking?
Just thinking.
"Where do you bank, James?"
In Syracuse?
Where do I bank?
"Your personal accounts, business accounts."
What's the name of your bank?
It doesn't matter.
"The rules on access are the same, industry-wide."
Ashur.
Dagan.
Take position.
Begin.
Good Tullius has taken his leave?
He has.
And what has he carried from our house this time?
"Ashur, fucking victor!"
"Rest, and tend wounds."
Tomorrow brings end of contest and appropriate reckoning.
I would have words.
As would I.
"Accompany me to town, and let us break them."
Melitta.
"Once they have departed, something I would ask of you."
I have felt your eyes lingering.
-Mrs.
Mackenzie...
She committed suicide over the kind of life Lucas brought them to.
We're not concerned here over Mrs. Cross' suicide.
But I don't see why not.
There was something terribly wrong in the Cross family life.
-Mrs.
"Mackenzie, if you please..."
"-Something wrong when a woman... had to raise her daughter up almost alone and trying to help her, and..."
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-...not being able to help.
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-Not being able to give...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I'm aware of your deep concern over the suicide... but that's not the point at issue."
Did your daughter ever tell you she had seen Lucas beating Selena?
No.
Don't you think that if she had seen such a shocking incident... she would've mentioned it to you?
-I don't know.
"-Well, wouldn't she?"
Well...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, didn't your daughter ever bring home her problems?"
How many times do I have to answer your questions?
Until we find out the truth.
The truth is... my daughter did bring her troubles home... and I wouldn't understand.
"Well, if she did bring her problems home, did she ever... I wouldn't understand!"
The court will adjourn for a short recess.
Come in.
-What have I done to Selena?
-You had no choice.
But I did have a choice.
We could've picked them off easy.
"Jacoub, we're good, if we stay in this direction, yeah?"
"Yes, that way."
No point in rescuing Clare if we can't all get out again.
"You do want to get home, don't you?"
See your wife?
"That's a wedding ring, right?"
What about kids?
Got any of them?
"Okay, no kids."
Your marriage is shit.
That's starting to make more sense...
Don't fucking shrink me!
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
I know self-loathing when I see it.
How reckless that can make a man.
That's why I'm here.
"Only I want to rescue Clare, not die trying."
"Now, we're professional fucking soldiers."
We got a job to do...
You're not a fucking soldier.
"You're a scumbag arms dealer, selling mass murder."
"So, yes, you should fucking hate yourself."
"That's why Clare hates you too, right?"
"But that's your shit to work out, not mine."
I don't give a fuck if she forgives you or not.
I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
And that's to get that information on Latif.
No...
Which I'm starting to think is just some bullshit... story you're selling...
I'll keep my part of the deal.
"Really, Crawford?"
Don't get close to me!
"If you do, I'll jump!"
Miss.
Please move away from there.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go of me.
Will you be responsible if she jumps?
Don't come close!
What's the problem this time?
No one loves an ugly girl like me.
I have to die!
I understand how you feel.
But how could you throw your beautiful body into such a sewage-infested river?
But you put me into a box and humiliated me.
I wanted to start a new life in the circus.
"All I do is eat and sleep, so I've gained weight."
"Look, do you know how many people envy you?"
Why?
Because you're human.
Being human is a special right.
You know how many things try so hard to be human?
A werewolf.
A vampire.
And that's not all.
Even foxes.
"Yes, even foxes."
"In order to be human, they've withstood other's mockery, being called a goblin or monster."
"They've endure so much for a long time, almost 1000 years."
But you're giving up your humanity merely because of your appearance?
You know how precious your life is?
And you have one thing you have left to do.
"You need to fall in love before you die, right?"
"We need a distraction, so you can set the prisoners free."
"The mutineers are all on edge, because they think there are demons on this island."
My good friends here will help supply them.
What about your spirits and laying bones to rest?
"They are happy, crusoe."
I have discussed it with them.
Even spirits need a change of scenery now and again.
But I promised to return them once it is done.
Those mutineers are tough.
They'll not buy this.
The tough ones always fear the most.
Think back when you first came here.
"Alone on the island, when the sun went down."
"No hope, no help."
And no name for the things you feared the most.
Come out!
You are without a doubt the most surprising human being I have ever known.
We can take care of things from here.
"I think we will be quite all right, thank you."
Our orders are to watch you at all times.
"But not while we wash, surely."
Nolan!
Look.
What?
Back to camp.
Now!
Move!
And that is just the beginning.
Come on.
We've got work to do.
Do you understand these people?
Neither do I.
Good.
What can you tell me about the prison?
I know about the prison.
We need all the information we can get.
I have to reach my crew.
Don't you think there are people in there
I'd like to get out?
Any sane person would tell youit's impossible.
Spoken like a coward.
"I've heard about you, old man."
You're the coward!
Enough.
What are you doing with this lunatic?
Has he been telling you stories of his brave deeds?
They're just fantasies.
Taking him along on this rescue mission of yours is suicide.
He's already saved me from the Mokra once.
And he saved you from those soldiers today.
"All right, stay with him."
"Go off to the prison, get yourself killed."
I don't have to get killed if you'll tell me what you know.
There are access tunnels on the north side.
"They'll get you in a little closer, but they're guarded."
Then I'll need weapons.
They're not free.
I don't have anything to trade.
Thas worth some weapons.
I can't.
"Yes, you can... if ill help to bring her back to us."
Thank you.
I can have someone meet you on the street in three hours to make the trade.
He'll be wearing a blue vest.
Seems like Big Sis's type
"4,800 yen..."
That's quite expensive...
Heard he got busy and stopped writing
Still too expensive...
This fact wasn't written in any of the Books of Prophecies
"Impressive! ""Bon"" Natsuko the forever damned hunter with the blood of 108 sexual demons"
You can't seem to escape the wrath of sexual desire
"Oh, a sigh like a beast's roar"
So we didn't buy anything after all.
Sorry!
No it's Ok
"No, I'm really sorry"
"I didn't really care though, as long as I got the feel of Boy's Love"
"No, no, no!"
It doesn't work like that
"Without caution, you may dislike us BL lovers as well"
That's also why it was such a hard decision
But it's not like I'd start hating you
"Well, thank you then"
I thought you'd say that
"Well no, more than that..."
I don't want you to start hating anal
What?
Ok...
Um...
Let's eat
Thanks
"So, which do you like better, games or BL?"
You're gonna ask me that?
Um... nevermind
I know you can't choose
But I've come for the singing - my teacher put me down on the list.
Baker.
You're an hour late.
Am I?
Bakers get up early.
Baker's the one with the music teacher's recommendation.
"So you wouldn't make a very good baker, would you?"
Do you have an excuse?
"Oh, he will have."
Sinners always do.
Judas had an excuse when he betrayed our Lord.
That sniper on Vimy Ridge had an excuse when he shot my leg off.
"All right, Kirkby, keep it Methodist."
Let's give him five minutes.
"Stand by the piano, please, Baker."
Face this way and really sing out.
Do you know your note?
"It's a B, Miss."
# I want to make you proud I want my song to let you see
# Who I can be when I belong
"# I'll give you all I have, I'll never swerve"
# I'll be the boy that you deserve
# See who I am A boy with a heart
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me.
# He wants to make you proud he wants to shine
# He wants to hear you say that boy is mine
# We know your love is there just in disguise
# He needs to see it in your eyes
"# Look who I am, a boy with a heart"
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
Forget it.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, how about a mini celebration?"
"All right, we'll just keep it simple, just the things that Judah loved, chicken parmesan, Willy Wonka, the original not the lame Johnny Depp piece of shit."
"A piñata, lap dance."
Celia.
"Hey, take it easy."
All right.
Enough.
I never should have done this!
They hate me!
They hate me!
This is all your fault!
"God, if you would have just put a fucking light in at the intersection!"
- I was going to.
"- Oh, right, you were?"
"But you were being this know-it-ally bitchface,"
- I couldn't resist fucking with you.
"- Yeah, and you still can't."
City Council is pretty much the only thing in my life
I didn't have to get baked to get through.
You took that away from me.
How did you know about Walter's boat garage?
"Celia, everything that happens in government is motivated by self-interest."
Someone's always trying to put one over on someone else so they can get something they want.
We're all just nothing but a bunch of selfish assholes.
"Remember that, and you won't go wrong."
Thank you.
Celia.
You should bring some vodka to the council.
- Vodka.
- That's what I used to do.
You think they like anyone?
Because the stone is too small
If use bigger stones you may not require lens
Only ladies have come?
What about the male members?
He is a merchant at Rangoon
He will come once in three years only
"Bye, visit frequently"
"Quick, If you delay like this you will be late for school"
-Look there
- How did he come here?
Why are you standing here?
This is my house We are the new tenants
-ls that so?
"-OK, you may go"
"Careful, leg, gently"
Bye
"Mom,you have gone there without giving me breakfast"
That girl insisted that I must attend the house warming
"Poor girl, she is one legged, bye!"
One legged?
What is he saying?
"-She had both the legs, right?"
-Yes
What do you think about yourself?
Will you give us the amount demanded by us or not?
Do you know who we are?
"If you donate funds for us you are saved, otherwise..."
Let us see how you run this factory
You are talking over phone as we are screaming from here?
Creating mischief?
will tear you apart
"Boss, did you call me?"
- On her husband
- last night at the cocktail party.
- Before he was killed ?
Yes.
I don't want to get her in trouble.
Do you have the application on you ?
"Term policy, a million upon death."
Jennie Hale.
She signed it.
Any idea where she is now ?
"No, I'd like a small service."
"Uh, nothing too pricy."
"No, no."
Cremation.
That's what my husband would have wanted.
So Jennie's got a million reasons to kill her husband.
Should we bring her in ?
I want forensic proof.
She'll wiggle out of it too easily.
Everyone bought one of those policies.
We may have forensic proof.
"There was trace on the murder weapon,"
- Bahamian aragonite.
- Sand ?
"Produced by coral reefs in the Bahamas, high pH, large granule size, unique to the region."
- So our killer was in the Bahamas.
- Not necessarily.
Remember that yearbook we looked at ?
"Oh, yeah. ""Senior class trip to the Bahamas was awesome."""
"I got a way to find out where that champagne bottle came from, but we're going to have to go back in time."

- Yeah.
Good idea.
[ Fireworks popping ]
Thank you for helping me through a very strange time in my life.
"If this was all fake, how come you have an illegal-fireworks guy?"
I'm a stay-at-home mom with a full-time nanny.
I get up to stuff.
And what goes well with an LA face?
It's an Oakland booty.
- Jump around.
- [ Laughter ]
Jump around.
Jump around.
When do we start?
Today?
Can we make it official?
I don't mind it.
Ah!
Can I say on SNS that I'm dating Sin Joon Young?
Welcome.
"Noona, what's with the both of you?"
"I don't know, I think she caused a problem again."
She's been like this for thirty minutes.
Do you think you'll die like that?
Did you cause another problem?
I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Huh?
I think I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Why?
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a variety show as a documentary.
"I mean, I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a variety show."
"No, no."
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a documentary.
- What are you saying?
- I think she went crazy.
I'm not crazy!
"Why are you always only like that towards me, Unni?"
"Since you look down on me like that, everyone else in the world doesn't take me seriously and looks down on me."
"You can't even make a sound to Sin Joon Young,"
"You don't say anything about him being crazy, but how come you only call me psycho?"
Am I that easy?
This little...
Hey!
Was I unable to say anything to Sin Joon Young?
"The real question is, why are you being like that to me?"
"By the way, I'll tell you as a woman..."
"Citizen, the note is in my pocket."
Don't forget.
"--Be so kind as to give me a chair --Pavel Ivanovich, why do you bother?"
--I kindly ask you.
--We can do it ourselves...
--Thank you --You're welcome
"And hand me the rope, please."
--Thanks --Sure
--Take this --Thanks
Be careful.
You're too heavy for this shaky table.
--Move away please --Where to?
--There
You wanted to hang yourself and be a burden on my conscience
"It won't work, Ermakov."
No!
But I can do much better!
"I kill human beings, sending them back to where they came from or I take their sight of the sun by blinding them."
I decide who lives and who dies  the city that I will build!
I will create an immortal Rome!
Not even the mighty Olympus will not be able to prevent the birth of this city!
Oh mighty Cesar.
"Now I know, that you are mad."
Mad?
Why?
Because I take what I want without asking?
Because I have everyone executed who hates or betrays me?
I simply wipe away the worms which are attracted by the fetidness of their souls and which they try to hide under their tunicas.
"No Petreius, I'm not mad."
I am free!
I am the only free man in the world!
And Norah doesn't despise Tris.
We spend a lot of time trying to define the relationship between the three girls.
"Because that idea of, like, ""frienemyship"" is hard."
"And so there's like a lot of debates, like, figuring out how mean they were to each other versus how friendly they were versus how passive-aggressive."
There was a lot to figure out.
And I...
Here we go.
Here it is.
- Here it is.
Here it is.
"- Michael, you stop doing that."
"Wait, watch for it."
There was no cut when we did this.
"- Okay, I'm gonna call my boyfriend."
- This is the gum.
- It looks fake.
- It looks fake.
- It looks like a skillful editing trick.
- Like someone passed me a new...
- No.
"- No, that's dirty gum."
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
"And, also, I should point out that I think Alexis and myself and Ari decided that we had all been friends since babyhood, basically."
- That's why we all tolerate each other.
- Right.
I figured that about me and Raf and Aaron too.
- We all grew up together.
- Stop trying to copy our ideas.
"No, it's the same with us."
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
Maybe.
It's a funny thing to sell your soul for... ..a new beamer.
Yeah.
Cars have never really done it for me.
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
"One you gave the full VIP treatment to, I'm told."
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could have hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Poor man had been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
We'd best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
With fishing rods.
Little ones.
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
What will this sister of mine do with rice?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast.
- Ou!
"- Oh, help me!"
Help me!
"lam robbed, sir, and beaten."
"Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee."
"Oh, good sir, tenderly."
- Oh!
- How now!
Can'st stand?
Dost lack any money?
I have a little money for thee.
"No, good sweet sir, offer me no money, I pray you"
- That kills my heart.
- Then fare thee well.
I must go and buy spices for our sheep-shearing.
"Prosper you, sweet sir, I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too."
"♪ Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way"
♪ And merrily hent the stile-a
♪ A merry heart goes all the day
♪ Your sad tires in a mile-a ♪
"Reverend sirs, for you there's rosemary and me."
Grace and remembrance be to you berth and welcome to our sheep-shearing.
"Come, a dance, I pray"
"Your hand, my Perdita."
This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever ran on green-sward.
"Good sooth, she is the queen of curds and cream."
"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter?"
They call him Doricles
"He says he loves my daughter, I think so too"
I think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best.
That's right!
Wow!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
This is the greatest discovery since...
"I don't know, television or something!"
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...
"No, they'll panic."
People always wig out and start shooting when they see something big like you.
- Hmm?
"- Oh, wig out."
It means crazy.
"You know, like, uh... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)"
"No, no, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the kind of stuff that makes them shoot at you.
MANSLEY:
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar detected an unidentified object entering Earth's atmosphere."
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half miles off the coast of Rockwell.
Some assumed it was a large meteor or a downed satellite.
But my office in Washington received a call from someone who reported an actual encounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
So...
"So, we can't call Ripley's Believe It or Not because they wouldn't believe it."
- And...
- (WAKES UP WITH A START)
"Oh, it's getting dark."
And if I don't get home soon
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.
"And then they come in all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"So, it goes a little something like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"And then they get all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"Say, ""Yes!"
"Oh."""
I don't think that's how they do it.
I'd have to hears it again.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Yeah.
"Yeah, porno girls do that."
"But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some super-low tone and repeating over and over again,"
"""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
"I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, ""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos.
"Well, then you should do voiceovers for English-dubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
"Why thank you, Miss Katy."
"I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
KATY:
"Let me hear yours, Dary."
"Well, I..."
"I'm confused still on the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's."""
"So, Wayne, it's like, uh,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes""?"
"See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it?"
You're saying it like it's a question.
"So, it's like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"You're gettin' closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it."
You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it.
"Like, ""Yes!"""
"""Yes!"""
"Yeah, let's go."
"[Man] In John 10:10, Jesus tells us..."
"""I came so that everyone would have life and have it in its fullest."""
"So, since God planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now... why are so many of us... hurting and angry inside?"
It's because we refuse to believe in God's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only... so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
The Lord sacrificed His only Son for us... paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment.
"It sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
[Chattering]
Oh.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
She's a blessing to us too.
- Paige says you work in travel.
- Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
- Mmm.
"- Yeah, we..."
"Yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips... see all the good her generous donations are doing.
Do not listen!
It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.
"""I command you..."
"""...by the Judge of the Living and the Dead..."
"""...to depart from this servant of God!"
"""It's the power...."""
"Stick your cock up her ass, you mother-fucking worthless cock sucker!"
Be silent!
"""Our Father, who art in Heaven..."
"""..."
Hallowed be Thy name.
"""Thy kingdom come."
Thy will be done...
"""...on earth as it is in Heaven."
"""Give us this day our daily bread."
"""Forgive us our trespasses..."
"""...as we forgive those who trespass against us."
"""And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one."""
"""Save me, O God, by Thy name."
"By Thy might, defend my cause."
"""Proud men have risen up against me, and men of violence seek my life..."
"""...but God is my helper and the Lord sustains my life."
"""In every need He has delivered me."
"""Glory be to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit."
"""As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end."""
"-""Save your servant..."
- Can you not refer to it as that?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
When were you menstruating out your pussy?
"No, the um..."
The-
- Can you not say...
"""pussy""?"
"Oh, yeah, sure, fine."
Whatever.
"Okay, so I'm gonna take two fingers,"
I'm gonna put 'em in your hair pie.
"I'm gonna feel around, apply some pressure to your ovaries and check you out for beav cancer, okay?"
- Listen...
"- Oh, did I press too hard?"
I apologize.
- No.
"- Okay, well, everything feels fine, so now I'm just gonna go ahead and clamp your clam open and then swab around the inside of your tuna taco"
- and I'll have you on your way.
"- Yeah, no."
Can you just use the clinical term for vagina?
I don't-
- I don't see what's so hard about just saying vagina.
I don't understand.
Are you referring to your sausage wallet?
- Sausage wallet?
"- You know, your lizard mouth."
Does it really feel normal to you to refer to it this way?
I-
- That would be like a proctologist calling a butt a--
Butt?
"Oh, God."
I'm sorry.
And those propeller plans that you got for me... the plans you and Emmett worked to steal...
They were fake.
F-Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"[Sighs] Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
"And I wondered, do they even care how many people die?"
This administration...
"The stuff they get away with, it makes me sick."
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated.
Just think about all those... kids that died.
[Knocking]
[Elizabeth] Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted... and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"I saved a child, but failed in my delivery."
God's ways are hard for us to penetrate.
"Benvolio, you can come no further."
Now take this letter early in the morn and see you deliver it to my lord and father.
"Farewell, Benvolio."
Let us say good night.
No.
But... but why descend into this bed of death?
"Partly, I must behold my lady's face."
"Chiefly, I'd return this precious ring to her fair hand which gave it me."
And now be gone.
"I go, and do not seek to question you."
By which you show your love.
"Goodbye, dear friend."
"Banished Romeo Montague, who murdered Juliet's cousin, noble Tybalt... causing her the grief that took her to the grave."
And now he comes to desecrate the dead.
Leave them to heaven and attend to me.
"We needs must fight, for you are bound to die."
The very reason why you find me here.
"I am Count Paris, and I here defend the grave of she who should have been my bride."
"Oh, good, gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury.
"Oh, fly hence."
"Be gone, survive."
What?
Should I buy this proof of your concern?
Or is a Montague afraid to fight?
"May God bless you, Paris."
Friar!
Friar Laurence!
- Friar Laurence!
- Who's there?
"- Yeah, a plain wrap..."
"And, well, it was about marriage and sex."
I had it sent to me at the post office.
It took me two weeks to get up the courage to go pick it up.
Look... .
"I know it sounds funny, but it was the only way I could find out anything."
"Norman, you know what?"
I sent for a book just like that in the same plain wrapper general delivery.
"- No, really?"
The same one?
"And I read every word of it, and I think most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense."
Maybe yours was better.
"Hey, want to trade books?"
No.
I'd be too embarrassed.
"That's your whole trouble, Norman."
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.
I know.
And I'm sorry we started talking about all this.
"Hey, Norman, look... ."
It's about time you learned that girls want to do the same things as boys.
And they have the right to know how.
"I mean, I think we should help each other."
- Are you suggesting that...?
"- Norman, don't get me wrong."
"All I want is some normal, intelligent discussion and maybe some normal affection between a boy and a girl, nothing more."
Everybody in this town hides behind plain wrappers.
You're so afraid.
You've even been afraid to ask me to the graduation dance.
"Allison, I want... ."
"Well, see, I'm just not asking anybody."
"Your Honor, it would take two years to go through all the discovery they dumped on us,"
"Plus, I'm dealing with this police matter right now."
It is not my concern.
My concern is this case.
You're not getting two years to try this case.
"I'm not asking for that, Your Honor."
"Listen, this case either moves forward, or it stops."
"It's time to either put up or shut up, counsel."
What's it going to be?
"Did you hear me, sir?"
"Yes, sir, I heard you."
Put up or shut up.
The plaintiff chooses put up.
- I beg your pardon?
- [click]
We call ready for trial.
[whisper] What are you doing?
[whispering]
"We're not ready for trial, Your Honor."
Why not?
You've got about a million lawyers working on this.
- [scoff]
- I call ready for trial.
"This is a dangerous game you're playing, Mr. McBride."
You haven't gone through the discoveries.
You haven't deposed their witnesses.
"Well, I have a pretty good idea what they're gonna all say."
Judge:
Do I understand this correctly?
"You're ready to proceed to trial now, today."
"Yes, sir, that's correct."
- Miss Senate?
"Besides, I need you."
You're the one who's going to tell me where Doug is.
Oh.
Here.
Your car is in the campground parking lot.
What are we gonna do to resolve our problem?
"Well, I think our problems are a little different, but, yes, let's resolve them."
"You know, you and I have a very special connection."
- I'm not even sure who I'm talking to.
"- Oh, we met... in a manner of speaking."
"Istanbul, about six years ago."
July.
Seven years ago.
You took out those two diplomats.
Yes.
You know how close you came to catching me?
That was impressive.
"And ever since then, I've kept tabs on you."
You might say I've become a fan.
"I heard you got burned, and I got this gig in Miami, so... the stars just kind of lined up."
I like the new look.
And your bruise- it healed.
Yeah.
"Well, that was temporary."
I've been studying up on you.
"It's not easy with someone as secretive as you are, but, uh... of course, things got a lot easier when you got burned."
- Not classified material anymore.
- Lucky you.
I learned something about your early years.
Your daddy was mean.
Mmm.
"So I figured an abusive husband and a troubled but gifted son- well, that would be motivating."
- Ha!
Ha!
I'd hardy call fertilizer bomb-making equipment.
"No, no, no, no, the fertilizer's outside."
I put the bomb-making stuff in the community room closet for authenticity.
"Wait, wait, wait, what other bomb-making stuff?"
"A lot of electronics, gasoline, nails, combustible hairspray."
- It's in the community room?
"- Yes, in the closet."
In the closet?
"No, Baber, no."
"No, no, no."
"You realize if someone catches wind of this,"
"You could actually be in serious trouble, right?"
"Ah, I can take it!"
"I'm very tough, I'd survive Gitmo."
Tough?
You're afraid of the moon!
I don't like the way it looks at me.
Ugh.
"You do know that Gitmo's not taking new prisoners, right?"
You'd wind up somewhere much worse like the moon.
"- OK, I'll be good."
- Yeah.
"Now, let's go."
Let's get that stuff in your van and you can return it to the store.
[ dove cooing ]
"This place is a real steal, guys."
"But like I said, I shouldn't be showing it to you, the place is set for demolition."
Are you telling me this used to be an old schoolhouse?
Who would want to demolish this?
It's amazing!
Our artists have been up all night making their costumes.
It's terribly exciting!
You're not acting in this piece?
I have no stomach for farce.
I am here to cue you.
"When I signal you like so, you must play something which suggests rain."
I expect this will be very amusing.
Yes.
Alfred and George have really outdone themselves this time.
"Do you know, I think they are still in love with each other."
(KNOCKING)
- Clap.
- Good evening.
I am God.
"I have grown disappointed in my master creation, the human race."
I endowed them with everything.
"The riches of the land, sea and air."
And enough intelligence to worship me.
But they have become arrogant and pampered.
I shall destroy them.
All except for one man and his family.
DUCHESS:
Ah!
This is my servant Noah and his wife Noette and their children.
Into their hands do I place the future of mankind.
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never rain?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
"Ah, who can express the despair of youth married to age?"
My husband is 600 years old while I am but 150!
A dove!
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney, get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come afteryou?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebodyneeds to go to mymom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinneryet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up foryou, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe itwould be okay ifl, uh, crashed here forthe night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell mewhat's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and giveyou some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
'Cause that's loaded.
Yeah.
"- You're a class act, aren't you?"
- I'm a necessity.
Destroy the lives of innocent people just to keep me your slave.
Stop being so melodramatic.
You might learn to love me first.
"Well, what do you want?"
I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
His name is lain Risdale.
I think he was involved in the death of his commanding officer.
The man smells corruption.
"Things'll work out just fine, John."
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Ay, Papito, si."
"Duro, duro, duro."
More.
Ay delicioso!
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, f..."
"- Oh, what did I tell you?"
- Si!
Si!
Si!
Si!
"- Oh, si!"
- Oh!
Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould.
Gould had stepped down from the day to day running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being linked with the illegal arms trade.
"Police confirmed that Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin, targeting gun-running networks in Britain."
There was also speculation that the killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control gun-running in London.
- Where are you from again?
- Hampshire CID.
Yes.
The evenings are the most beautiful ones at us.
There is not warmth at this time.
And the blackout?
"Ow, oh my God!"
Do not have yourselves disturbed.
Go to bed.
I am a bad sleeping.
Well it because of that maybe not.
"Appropriate, that we wait for it, the major lord falls asleep."
Why is this girl so sly?
It is not possible to get used to it.
What is an idea under the piano.
"Ow, Gyula."
There is warmth here after all.
"Open it a little the door, Ágika."
what's up dear Tót?
How do you feel?
"Thank you, very well, respectable major lord."
I envy you.
You have lucky nature.
Tell Tót.
Would you not play chess with me?
"Major lord, I am really sorry for it, but i can't."
And a card game?
"I am ashamed of it very much major lord, but..."
I not know the cards.
Then we play with dominos.
"Respectable major lord, I...not know any kind of board game."
Tell it quite openly.
Do you not miss something for you if you are this here sit with your wife and your daughter in a beautiful night?
My pipe was made of the sour cherry tree only.I lost it somewhere unfortunately.
"Well, jim knows a lot more about business than i do."
"But you'll pardon me for saying it, but... i know more about women, and, uh- and you think he's made a bad investment."
His luck.
I'll take stocks and bonds.
"Hey, daniel!"
"Whoa, baby!"
Whoa.
"I might have known it was you, cornele vanderbilt."
A- whoopin' and a- rushing' around like a fiend in a fiery chariot.
You done near scraped the paint off my buggy.
"I'm sorry, daniel, but i wanted to make you an offer."
I thought maybe you might like to swap old bessie there for my team of thoroughbreds.
You want to swap that team for my bessie?
"Yes, daniel."
I'll swap you even- if you throw in the erie railroad.
It ain't no secret i'm gonna get control of erie.
I'm doing it because someone's got to protect the public from weasels like you.
Ya!
Now you boys listen to me.
That erie of mine is the best-paying railroad in america.
"For you, uncle daniel, or the stockholders?"
"For him, that's why he owns it."
Yes.
"When i get a good thing, vanderbilt don't sleep easy unless he gets some of the gravy."
Neither do we.
Who is he?
Do we have to put up with him?
He's the brains of our organization.
He don't look very bright to me.
What were you saying about the erie?
"When i say up, erie goes up."
"When i say down, erie goes down."
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah, and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.
It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from, Warden."
"Glad you approve, son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills, Mr. Petty."
Those are mints.
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.
An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.
Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle, the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself, under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites, the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"Were you scared, Mr. Petty?"
"No, ma'am."
This is absurd.
This is the...
Can't do this anymore.
"Now, look here, Fitzgerald..."
No.
"Mr. Little, allow me, for I believe this is the moment in the meeting wherein I quit."
What?
And lose dentists.
Go with the singular.
"""At the end of a long day serving others,"
"""this dentist relaxes with a calming Chesterfield cigarette."
"""It's all the service he needs."""
Write that down.
- Write that down.
- Okay.
"I've spent today in the graveyard, all washed and covered with weepy, watery blue flowers."
"I'll just say, but all the broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels mean romance to me."
"Out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers."
"They're exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss."
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
We will die together.
I know.
Out of a row of Confederated soldiers...
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
"So you see, dearest Scott..."
I've spent today in the graveyard.
[words overlapping] ...is to be young always.
We will die together.
I know.
I only stopped by to say hey when Roger has to suddenly go out back and check his bait tanks.
- I just want that to be known.
- You did.
You did.
"Okay, this is sexy."
This was the original beginning of the movie.
Right.
This is how the movie was gonna start before we shot...
"Yeah, this was the opening scene."
- Look at Rafi go.
- People went bananas for Rafi.
That's really Rafi's voice too.
That's him singing.
"Although, we're not playing those instruments."
He is the only one who's really doing it.
I'm playing an instrument.
- The love instrument.
- Your body is your instrument as an actress.
"When we rehearsed this scene, before we started shooting it in Don Hill's and we were listening to that song, it was one of the most exciting moments of all..."
"People love this song and they would, like, sing it between shooting it."
This was the first few days of shooting in here.
- Why isn't this on the soundtrack?
- This was the first week of shooting.
- We were all strangers.
- It's not on the soundtrack?
It's on iTunes.
I'm gonna buy it.
"So, what are you talking about, Pete, with the stars in the sky or something?"
"Well, in the title design, they drew little squiggles and stuff in the sky."
"I was waiting for it to happen, it already happened."
"If you squint really hard and do like this, you can see."
- Okay.
- It's similar.
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-Iike arms and legs."
"And his green face, Iike a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-beIieve stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-beIieve, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you...."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao."""
"What'II you do, Grandma?"
I'II go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
AII right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
I'd be packing in no time.
No time at all.
That's very clearly stated.
"So, what do the rest of you think about what he just said?"
Should people take the law into their own hands like that?
"I mean, is that the answer?"
Does that solve anything?
Anyone?
Angela?
Angela?
And right before the gun went off...
I was thinking about how much I wanted that soda.
is that weird?
"Like, why did I leave it there in the first place?"
And what if I had gotten up to go get it right at that moment?
"Oh, my God. I think I better change my locker."
Like what happens when you don't sleep.
Like I haven't slept since it happened and keeps coming back to me...
just keeps coming back.
What was that?
I just keep going over and over in my mind.
Like all my friends and they go by the locker all the time...
"and it's just, not even me."
"If someone just had been going by there, and gotten shot."
"It's hard, isn't it?"
"You don't think I could get a few days off, do you?"
You are here again because I wanted to hear your story...
and Detective Martinson wanted to hear it too.
I really don't have anything else to tell.
M r.
"Krakow, can I tell you something?"
This is a good school.
They were not permitted to marry.
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.
"She was flung out of the house, and he was packed off to the army."
I think he'd have done himself harm if not for John.
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.
She disappeared from good society.
When Brandon returned from India he searched and searched. -
- Only to find her dying in a poorhouse.
I thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up.
Look at him now!
So attentive!
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please.
Let the colonel alone.
All suitors need a little help.
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.
Brandon shares your passion for music.
He plays the pianoforte well.
You know as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.
I do not know any duets.
"Forgive me, Colonel."
Will we never have peace?
The rent is low.
But it comes on hard terms.
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's daughters.
There's a parcel arrived.
Look!
She won't say a thing.
It's like she's thinking really hard about something.
We think...
We think that Maria doesn't remember a thing.
- What do you mean?
- She won't talk about it.
"We tell her about things like you and your house, but all she says is I don't remember."
Foguinho thinks she doesn't want to remember.
"If you ask me, she simply can't."
What did she say when you told her it was time to live with me?
She said she wants to stay in the circus forever.
I see.
"We explained that this is not possible, 'cause she is too little to work by herself like that."
She didn't like it one bit.
"I'm no educated woman like you, Mrs. Maria Cecflia, but I'm very candid and say what's on my mind."
It's a crying shame that Maria can't stay with us.
"You're her grandma, and you have the right but I think she'd be happier with us."
The magic rope trick requires great concentration.
- Are you concentrating?
- Yes!
My assistant Maria will give me a hand for the magic rope trick.
"Maria, pull very hard."
- Are you very concentrated?
- Yes!
"Let go, Maria."
"Foguinho, we're late."
There's a show tonight.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
"- Bye, kids."
Is it time already?
"Show us another trick, Foguinho!"
"Well, let's go eat and then you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
How's the cat?
"What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one out of them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
You remember that?
It's clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
Because when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice cosy cell.
And you won't be with me.
I'm still here.
"What do you do for them, Calum?"
"You know, pretty much what I've always done."
"Multitasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"Morning, flatmate."
You also burglarized the secret service.
I'll spend a little time in prison.
You're not getting what is important here.
I'm not getting what's important.
And the fact that I changed my name--
"Which, by the way, I did so the soviets wouldn't find me,"
Not to hide from our government.
Important.
That--Mrs.
Frederic fixed all this.
She expunged all the charges.
Someone obviously unfixed it.
"- Artie, focus."
"- Oh, I'm focused."
Here's the key.
Who gave Dickinson my file?
"Find out, that'll take you directly to who has the sword."
And that will lead you to Macpherson.
Who?
Time's up.
"Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time."
Put in for transfers while this whole warehouse business
Is still just a sidetrack in your careers.
Scars don't have to be permanent.
- Yeah.
No can do.
- Just think about it.
"Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do too."
"Now, I may not be your boss anymore,"
"But until someone tells me otherwise,"
I still outrank you.
So this time I am putting you on a plane
He wants to destroy the whole world.
Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?
He really does have a doomsday device?
"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during harmonic convergence, which is only a few days away."
"If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over."
"Sir, we desperately need your help."
"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
There are lives on the line!
And my daughter is one of them.
"Raiko, you must reconsider."
"I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here."
"If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim, I need to protect my citizens."
I'm sorry.
Sir...
Nuktuk needs your help.
I know you love helping people.
"Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
I never should have saved that guy.
"If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
"Yeah, me too."
Thank you.
It's so good to see you guys again.
"Wait, where's Mako?"
So how was the big premiere?
I saved the president!
In real life!
"Wait, what?"
You were right about Varrick.
He tried to kidnap Raiko!
I knew it.
"But it didn't work, because of you."
And because of me.
"Eric, we need an address on Julio Pena, and I need you to meet me there right now."
Thank you.
All clear.
All clear.
- H...
- Yeah.
You've got an X-ray machine.
This is a source of the radiation.
"Hazmat didn't register any, so where'd it go ?"
This cable's the pig tail.
Houses an iridium capsule at one end.
Iridium's the source of the radiation.
Capsule's been removed.
This is bigger than we thought Eric.
Why was Julio involved in this ?
Because someone was using him to finance the operation.
So Julio was caught in between the two worlds.
Whoever did this needed to get to him before we did.
Got a serial number.
We need to trace that number.
"Mr. Thomason, last year you purchased ten X-ray machines."
For welding seams.
I'm planning to start a construction company.
Then explain to me how one of them ended up in Julio Pena's workshop.
Don't know who that is.
Mr. Pena sells drugs in order to purchase the machines.
"Once in his possession, he dissembled them."
Dissembled them ?
- Why would anyone do that ?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me... !
This conversation is over.
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them, either."
I lost courage!
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant,"
"My acting was stupid, I didn't know what to do with my hands."
I couldn't control my voice.
"You don't know what it feels like,"
knowing that you act atrociously.
I am a seagull.
"Since I came here I've been walking a lot,"
"I walk, and I think intensely, and I can feel my soul strengthening."
"I know now,"
"I understand, Kostia,"
"That in our trade, artist or writer, the essential is neither the glory, nor the sparkles, all that I dreamt of."
The essential is to know how to endure.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith.
Here's the item.
It's intact.
"Now, let's talk details."
"Abhorrent, isn't it?"
"Are they plotting, or what?"
Our fiancées.
Here's a doll.
"Here's the head, here's the feet."
I turn her upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes."
There!
Show me where the head is?
"Now, her feet."
And now her sex.
"That's a good one, huh?"
Isn't it?
I have heard dogs can see in black  white only
Is this dog an exception?
"Sister, come"
If you make noise I will break your head
Stop
Who are they?
They are guests to our area Why do you chase them?
I can understand
That poor girl wore a red color dress
You should not have chased a one legged girl
One legged?
Were you not running?
Running?
"No, I am one legged?"
How can I run?
Let me think about it
"Oh no, it seems you have come running"
Holding my sister I was leaping
You might not have noticed the leg because of the skirt
"You are right, you may go"
She is one legged
You are deceiving him as one legged....
The truth will come out one day
He is going to make you one legged
-Be careful
-Let us see
Can't find a place in Ukkadam to start the party office?
Half of the city has already been acquired by us
Stop
Whose building is that?
Belongs to Dr. Nallamuthu
How is his background?
"When it's done,"
- do you think you're gonna fly home or...
- I-I-I don't know.
"Look, you don't have a fear of flying."
"You're afraid of something else, but the thought of flying triggers that fear."
"Maybe you're not afraid of flying, you're afraid of going away."
- What do you mean?
I-I don't get that.
- Just...
Ace that presentation.
Ok.
Seniors...
How can we get them to use the Internet?
"In the past, we have simplified it, restricted access, dumbed it down."
But I think that's the wrong approach.
I don't think seniors are any more confused by the Internet than I am.
I think they're afraid of it.
"Watch this video, please."
My name's Al Jordan.
I'm 82 years old.
- Do you ever use the Internet?
- I wouldn't want to mess it up.
We created a mock form that's really a search engine.
"Each time you enter a term, it takes you to a related website, then you have to find your way back."
- The form has changed.
- Yes.
"Now I'm looking outside those,"
- put in Saskatchewan.
- Yes.
So I'm gonna leave you for about three hours
"Wait, wait."
What if I break it?
I don't know.
I could teach you your abc's.
In that case I might be a willing pupil.
Are you one of those rich refugees coming here looking for more money?
And sympathy.
"Well, I 'm not in the sympathy market yet but I guess we're both in the money market."
What're you gonna do in America?
"Oh, maybe I'll steal a little."
What do you do?
"I float, I drift."
I look...
"That's the man, officer."
What's the trouble?
You were on the ship that just came in?
"I'm awfully sorry about this, but my wallet was taken out of my pocket while I was getting my baggage."
Would you care to search me?
With your permission.
That's not my wallet.
Clementi Sabourin.
Is that your name?
Yes.
Is that what people do to each other in America?
Everybody frisking everybody else?
I'm awfully sorry.
"Tell me, uh... did you have very much money in that wallet?"
"I had about five hundred in currency, a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars..."
Of course I can have that stopped at the bank.
But there was a very important document.
"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't find it."
And so am I.
"This man does not have your wallet, sir."
We'll have to go back to the pier.
-But I'm going just the same.
Stay here!
"You belong here, both of us, together!"
-We've been friends ever since...
"-Good-bye, Selena."
But your mother?
How can you leave her alone?
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena... I cried all the way to New York... and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves... that had started to fall back home."
"For days, I struggled to keep alive... and I shivered with loneliness in the back room of nowhere."
There were times when lwanted to crawl home... but somehow I managed and I stayed.
I learned what I could endure.
But none of us in New York or in Peyton Place... could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter... of deep despair.
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings... driving their sons to a place of hurried good-bye.
I prayed forthem.
"Come on, fellows, get your last cup of civilian coffee."
That army stuff is used for waterproofing shingles.
That's what I heard.
Make yourself.
-Take a cup.
-Did you hear what Norman Page did?
"-Yeah, became the first 4-F in town."
"-No, he enlisted in the paratroopers."
-No kidding!
-Our Norman?
-Norman Page?
-He volunteered.
The paratroopers.
It's the funniest thing I've heard in years.
Maybe they'll drop his mother with him.
"She'd kill 1,OOO Japanese before letting one touch her little boy."
Brought you a donut.
Force of habit.
Fire marshals will be by to talk with her next.
Any impressions?
"If I had to guess, I'd say she was telling the truth."
Where's Joan?
She's at your computer.
"Said she has a theory as to how Tendu got his $100,000."
What do you got?
"Oh, hey."
"So, this is one of the last pictures that Tendu uploaded to social media."
"Now, the logo belongs to a company called AmpVX."
They make top-of-the-line headphones.
"According to this, the headphones he's wearing haven't even been released yet."
"A friend of mine who dated a Met once, she said the guy never wore brand name unless he was getting paid."
Tendu is a professional athlete now.
Significant percentage of the money athletes make is from sponsorship deals.
How do we get ahold of someone from AmpVX?
There won't be anyone in the New York office until tomorrow.
But?
In Beijing...
it's already tomorrow.
WATSON:
Hao.
Your call went well.
It did.
What is that?
That's roasted huitlacoche.
It's corn smut.
Do you want some?
Ugh.
No thanks.
"So, the VP at AmpVX's Beijing headquarters said they signed Tendu to a five-year, multi-million dollar sponsorship deal."
- And she is?
- Dr Goodyear's partner.
- Research partner?
"- Good Lord, no, she's not got the brains for that."
Her lesbian life partner.
It turns out Janet Cramer's got the bulk of the research squirreled away somewhere and won't give it back.
"Says it's hers, not ours."
"I really can't be dealing with these people, you know."
"What, lesbians?"
Librarians.
Oh.
"Awful, small-minded, orderly, finicketty little nobodies, stuck away in their dusty, desiccated bloody towers."
That research has to be returned to its rightful place.
It's for the good of the college.
Scientists have been waiting two decades for it to be published.
I've tried to reason with her but she won't listen to me.
Thinks I'm some antiquated ogre.
But she might listen to you.
I see...
"Tell me, when exactly does your nomination for Master come up?"
Peter!
SCOTT:
"Being a lawyer's easy, there's nothing to do."
You and I need to have a little chat.
Someone to see you.
- Good morning.
- It's my cats.
They need to be looked after when I'm gone.
- Right.
Come through.
(Phone rings)
"Don't worry, boss, I'll hold your calls."
Um... those are bluebells.
They're for my sister's bouquet.
They're cute.
"We went the ""beauty and meaning"" route, so every flower is symbolic."
"Like,bluebells are for humility."
Peonies.
They're for sharing a happy life.
"And,uh... these little guys?"
Those are... those are lilies of the valley.
They're for sweetness.
# I can feel the pressure building #
# And I want you like I don't know #
"# Oh,boy #"
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# And I love it when you're around #
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# You know I'm playing with you now. #
"I missed you so much,my angel."
My heart... is so... full right now.
"So was he crying with... with sound, or just physical tears?"
A little sound.
Did he at least throw himself into traffic after?
No.
"After,we talked about the intense feelings he has for me and why he has them."
"Which should be fun,right?"
I don't know why I spend so much time on my abs when nothing turns women on more than indifference.
"- Not what it's about,Cy."
- All I know is rocker guy was a changed man when he was blowing you off.
And then he cried.
"Just saying,she's a girl who needs the chase."
"- No,I'm not."
"- Yeah,you are."
It is true.
I forgot about the age being busy with the missions.
You should be very alert in this mission.
I am into form with my first success.
I will rage up now sir.
"No, just follow Karthik and that is enough."
"IG sir has asked me to follow you, keeping aside my seniority."
What should I do?
You should do acting.
There should be content in the character and I will sit in that putting a tent there.
"Your acting should be very simple, natural and convincing."
Stop it.
I gave performance as a jobless barber for 1 year.
I withstood the troubles as a waiter at the bar for 2 years.
I begged on the shore of the Musi River for 3 years.
I sold dry fish in hot summer without slippers.
Not even one could find me out as undercover.
What have you achieved doing all these?
It is dirty acting with expectations.
It is natural acting doing for happiness.
Take any creature in this nature and I will show you living as that.
Is it?
- Yes
Then the monkey.
Show us how it behaves in different situations.
Ask
Monkey in anger.
Monkey in fever
Cunning Monkey.
Alcohol drunken monkey..
Monkey feeling cold
"Wow, super!"
We take it very seriously.
"Look, in our e-mail,"
My husband and I said a lot of things.
Really it's just a bunch of words.
"What words were you referring to... ""drunk"" or ""nazi""?"
"Name-calling aside, once these matters come to light,"
We are mandated to address them promptly and swiftly.
"Well, what's prompter than forgetting about it?"
"You know, I've already moved on."
This type of behavior will not be tolerated.
You have to be stopped.
I'm sorry.
You're looking at me.
She's sitting over there.
"We're looking at you, dear."
We are all looking at you.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
This is starting to sound like it's about me.
Let's take a look at your file.
I have a file?
!
Mike!
"Uh, in her defense, she was very drunk."
"Besides harassing a teacher,"
"You've also been ""overreactive""..."
"""mildly threatening""..."
"""demanding special attention""..."
"Your ""intimidating behavior"
"Creates a hostile learning environment..."""
I am not the one who's hostile!
She's the one who's hostile!
- No.
I don't think so.
Did he know Diane?
"- He says no, but I think yes."
Are we gonna see him?
No.
How 'bout a piano player called Tickler?
"Well, I remember somebody at the club who played piano, but I don't recall his name."
"You know, Mr. Caine, it sounds like you didn't know anybody there, and nobody there knew you except Diane."
It was a long time ago.
I told you the club wasn't one of my hangouts.
I met Diane at the beach.
"Sure, I knew people, but I don't remember their names, even their faces."
"Look, there's only one person I am interested in meeting, and that's Diane."
"Now, if you haven't found her, where are you taking me?"
To jar your memory.
?
[ Radio:

[ Engine Shuts Off]
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Last place you saw Diane was here.
"No, no."
The last time I saw Diane was on the dock.
I told you that.
"You know, Magnum, you keep testing me, and I don't like it."
And you're not telling me everything you know.
"Come on, Mr. Caine."
It's tough enough finding a woman who disappeared 40 years ago without my own client sandbagging me.
"Magnum, there is nothing more I can tell you that'll help you find Diane."
Nothing.
You just have to believe me.
"Becky, give me a minute, will you?"
"Trevor, you know better than to come here."
"Yeah, I know."
I'm sorry.
We talked about this.
"Yeah, I know, Clark, but, please, I really have to talk to you."
- Not here.
Not now.
- But it's important.
"I'll come by as soon as I can, but get the hell out of here, and don't ever come back."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, ok."
That's much better.
That's much better.
Now you have to turn these both around.
This signature.
And then bring it...
Get everyone in there.
There are approximately two hours between Ramon's abduction here and his escape here.
He crossed the train tracks here.
"Now, given the time and distance parameters, there's no way the unsub could have ventured outside this radius."
"Ok, he said the train was close, and he heard laughter and loud music."
I looked at points of interest next to the train tracks and there really isn't much.
"There's a warehouse, a taco stand that would have been closed, and a bar called the Drunken Dog."
Why stop there?
He need a drink?
He doesn't seem like the drinking type.
He's not impulsive or sloppy enough.
"I live to serve you, sir."
"Garcia, what can you tell us about a bar called the Drunken Dog?"
"Ooh, I like it already."
Let's see.
"Uh, it's been around 30 years."
Get him on the truck.
Yeah.
Go.
it's all right.
24.
You're healing.
Just breathe.
by any measure.
"Oh, I used to do this as an extension of my hobby."
"I wrote stories that I thought were fun to read, and it felt good to have everyone else read and enjoy them."
But now...
I need money.
It's a commonplace reason.
"Isn't that okay, though?"
That's an ordinary reason for someone who writes for a living.
"If it leads to your motivation, I don't care what it is."
"Oh, there's one more thing that will motivate you, Sensei."

"Does she look innocent to you, of anything?"
Put your head back.
Put this on.
Better.
Let's go.
Self surreender
Are you entering a plea today?
Excuse us.
We're coming through.
Thank you.
We're here to stop an injustice.
"Yes, she had to defend herself--"
With this--The knife.
She has nothing to hide.
She asked us to turn this knife over
Because she wants the truth to get out.
"The bastard spins on my show,"
Then doesn't even give me an exclusive.
He's gonna pay for this.
She defended herself against a violent man.
"She deserves a medal, not a murder charge."
We will not let her be victimized
By the justice system.
That's it!
"The ""hollywood hooker homicide"" heats up."
Sources say she was a high-Priced prostitute
Who stabbed stein to death and picked his wallet clean.
The d.A.'S story is that ann is a prostitute
Who killed stein for the money in his wallet.
"Now the wallet was empty, but her prints weren't on it."
Now the d.A. Is going to say that she is lying
Of all the people!
Please don't say it like it was a terrible thought.
That superinjunction cost a lot of money.
DOORBELL
LAUGHTER
It's Rhys Darby!
Welcome.
Wow!
"Rhys Darby, ladies and gentlemen."
Have a seat.
Hi!
How are you?
Rhys Darby from Flight of the Conchords.
"Now then, everybody tonight has come dressed up because it's party time."
Are you a big partygoer?
"Oh, I'm king of the parties."
Really?
Not really.
LAUGHTER
Did you used to go...?
"Do you remember at the school disco at the end of the night, all having a great time, and then they'd play Happy Christmas (War Is Over)?"
# So this is Christmas... # And that was when all your mates would pair off with girls and I would be stood at the edge of the dance floor with my nose pressed against the window pane.
A metaphorical window pane.
Or were you one of the boys who managed to nab a girl for that important last dance/snog?
"Well, I'll admit"
I'm a keen dancer.
"And...and what I lacked in the initial, social, conversational period"
I would more than make up for once the song's come on.
I really clear my own space.
You can ask anyone and I am probably the hottest dancer that I know.
"Well, Rhys, I mean, we have a band."
We have a rug.
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
"By the way, I think I saw April making out with Shep Cale."
"All right, all right."
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
"Figure you should have something ready, so you don't embarrass yourself."
"You mean so I don't embarrass you, because you don't have to worry."
"Oh, is that how you spell ""venereal disease""?"
"Jake, this day is important to me, okay?"
Just because your life's a big joke doesn't mean you have to treat mine that way.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is my life a joke?
Just read the speech.
"No, seriously, Eric, why is my life a joke?"
I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder what you've been doing?
You spend all that time in flight school getting your license.
"Instead of using it, you come back here, and you hang out like it's the summer after high school."
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
"Well, hey, if I'm such a joke, then why'd you want me as your best man?"
"You didn't want me, did you?"
"No, not really."
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Ow!
Damn it!
I didn't want to ruin our trip.
Seriously?
You know most chatter doesn't lead anywhere.
All it manages to do is scare people.
I also know that you would have never kept a secret if I was still at NSA.
"It's not a secret, Ellie, it's just a... you know, slightly calculated omission."
You know what that sounds like?
Like a reasonable justification.
"I think she was going for ""lie,"" but ""to-may-to, to-mah-to,"""
let's not argue semantics.
Let's talk national security.
"It's Thanksgiving, in an airport, and we have the usual menagerie."
Here comes Walking Boot Wendy.
"Clearly faking it, in hopes of a free upgrade."
"I see you, Wendy."
I see right through you.
"Ah, and the inevitable Pajama Man."
"Rolls out of bed, grabs his passport."
Sees the world as his futon.
"Brad Pitt wants his hat back, hipster."
"Seriously, what are people thinking?"
My parents actually used to dress up to fly.
Mine still does.
You'll meet him when he gets here.
Huh.
Like that guy over there.
Dapper Don.
That's what I'm talking about.
"Jetting off to exotic locales, like James Bond chasing after Pussy Galore."
No smelly tracksuit for that dude.
What's with my Car Salesman?
Thought you said you were wrong about him.
"Listen, I know that you and Eric aren't close and maybe you didn't feel like standing up in front of a bunch of people and... acting like you were."
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing and doing what needs to be done are two different things.
"You don't have to worry about me, Dad."
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
"One day, I know you're gonna become the man I know you can be, the man you were born to be."
"My God, that day's gonna be something to see."
"Come on, Johnston."
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna head down to the lake and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...
"wait for Emily, say good night."
"I'll, uh... meet you there."
I'll save you a place.
Where's he going?
"Oh, he's waiting for Emily."
Gonna say good night.
Well... that's the last we'll see of him tonight.
Dad.
"Ah... listen, if I had a girl that looked like that,"
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
"Hey, you hear that, boy?"
I'm gonna take tha girl away from you.
"Yeah, you talk a good game."
"Eh, you better watch out for yourself, too."
Your wife is crazy about me.
"Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory switch to you three times a day."
"Jake, it's Constantino."
Looking for some cell service.
"Hey, why don't I sit in your lap and you can drive me around?"
"Two birds, one stone?"
I wasn't that attracted to you anyway.
I'm gonna go try to find some reception.
Seeing Randy miserable is the only thing that'll cheer me up right now.
Maybe he's crying.
"One vodka for the gentleman with the neck tattoo, and two vodkas for the lady who's into that sort of thing."
Thank you.
Your catfish tower's on its way.
It takes two to carry the cocktail sauce lagoon.
Everything on double-zero.
Which has to be the Yelp rating of this boat.
Excuse me?
Could I get a white wine spritzer?
"Oh, come on, Vera."
We share a locker.
"Oh, double-zero."
Winner.
"Yes, I'm a winner again!"
"Suck it, river people."
What is going on over here?
Employees are not allowed to gamble.
"Or, as of last week, sexually harass each other."
"Thanks a lot, Craig."
Ugh.
Poindexter in the radio room wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.
"Also, I broke your satellite phone."
That is it.
You're fired.
"That's the worst news I've heard since you said ""you're hired."""
There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.
"We can do this any way you want, Doc."
One to one from the chest...
Or we can all get down !
"Yeah, we can all really fuck this place up!"
(BELL ringing)
I'm not going against the guns.
"You're gonna lose, Doc."
"Any move you make, we're on you."
You fucked up!
(MEN clamoring)
"You're staying in the hole for as long as it takes to break up your little gang, Santana."
(GATE CLOSES)
SANTANA:
There was nothing the system could do to stop me.
I could run this show from solitary.
"Gracias, carnal."
J. D. taking care of business?
"Simón, ese, but the heat's on."
They're trying to break us up.
(SPEAKS spanish)
Danny's down in Soledad.
Stevie's down in Chino and Willie boy's in Vacaville.
"We need a meeting, keep ourselves together."
Any of our people on the outside coming up for trial?
Puppet's little brother got busted.
"Tell our lawyer to subpoena us, get us together in one place."
"The brothers send their love, carnal."
Gracias.
SANΤANA:
"Τhe state is so lame, they paid for the game."
There were a couple of things from some of our people who've already gotten out that weren't in sync with instructions I've been getting from inside.
Inside runs the show.
"Fortunately, the producers are two of my oldest and dearest friends."
"And, uh, ahem, I may be able to persuade the boys to part with a small piece of the show."
"Mind you, I said I might be able to."
"Chop's coming right along, my dear?"
"- Yes, in a moment, father."
"- Uh, may I?"
"- Thanks, I think I can manage."
- Ah..
"Charming girl, your daughter."
Nice of you to go to all this trouble for me.
"Oh, anything to make you happy."
(Tyler) 'It's a special ambition of mine to feature you' 'in my first production.
Or did I tell you.'
"(Patricia) 'Yes, I think you did.'"
"Sorry, I'm already rehearsing in a play."
- What kind of a play?
"- A musical called Hooray For Love, if you must know."
"Ooh, Hooray For Love."
Good show?
"(Patricia) 'Surely not as good as the one you'll produce, but it'll do.'"
"Huh, hot."
"Careful, not too much salt."
- You don't like salt?
- Hate salt.
You forgot this little corner over here.
Thank you.
"Tell me, uh, is the young one mine?"
How did you guess?
"Mr. Ganz, do you recall telling me the other afternoon when my daughter was rehearsing that you could use some additional money?"
"Whether you like it or not, you'll be in my fall production."
- Bet you my high head I won't.
- It's a bet.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
"All right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"Still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
The sad clown.
I've never seen it.
Carmela also painted a very different picture.
What do you mean?
"Volatile, punching the walls."
Compulsive gorging on food.
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle and bicycle horn.
I'm sorry.
"Maybe you'd like Carmela to be here, if I'm so fucking obnoxious."
"What I'm trying to establish is your response to sadness... is usually rage, not humor."
You two don't have to trouble yourselves.
Because I doubled my dosage.
I don't want you taking 80 milligrams of Prozac.
"You kick it up to 80 for a week, 10 days... just to pull back on the stick, get the nose up... then you duck back down to 40 before the limp dick thing sets in."
One:
that's ineffective.
Two:
it's not a treatment for grief.
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.
It's sad that you've lost something that you love.
"At the time, I had no idea that he was going to build a crazy boat."
It's a weird-looking thing.
"Yeah, we saw that coming in yesterday."
"""What the hell is that thing?"""
"Yeah, it looks like sort of a, you know, Jules Verne thing."
Lou built this boat out of steel.
It's a music barge that motors up to small towns all over the world and opens up into a concert stage.
"It was commissioned by a man named Robert Boudreau, who is both the ship's captain and the orchestra conductor."
I didn't tell him that I was Lou's son.
- Hi.
"- Hi, Robert."
Hi.
- Nice to see you.
"- Hi, there."
What are you up to?
Put that damn thing down.
"- Yeah, how are you?"
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- Quite a boat you have here.
- Thanks.
This is that symphony boat to that cruiser in front of us.
I think it might be a good idea if you just moved out until we went in to dock and then came back in.
"So, Robert, this boat is very futuristic."
"Oh, yeah, people say this thing's from Mars, you know?"
"You know, I love this boat."
"This is my boat, I created it, with Lou."
- So you loved him?
"- Oh, yeah."
"That's a Louie Kahn doorway for sure, isn't it?"
You don't get 'em any better than that.
Isn't that amazing?
"Well, take a look."
You are not going to destroy my family.
"I wouldn't let that cow, Jeanette, and I won't let you."
That's why I had to kill her.
"All right it's over, Mr. Barr."
I said it's over.
"She didn't care about James, about the family."
A money-grubbing tart.
"He'd given her shares in the company, in her name."
His shares.
Didn't tell me.
"Our American partners were ready to buy them strip our assets, junk us."
It was business trouble.
She was using that.
She wanted a million pounds to sell back the shares.
And so what if she broke us?
And the affair?
"There was no affair, just that day."
"I met her in the hotel, to try and persuade her to sell the shares for a more reasonable sum."
I thought she'd agreed to everything.
She was playing me.
I'd always had... she could look at you and make you feel... it was blackmail.
That's why she did it.
You see in the end
I didn't have a choice.
So it was a question of business.
What about your brother's first wife?
That wasn't business was it?
That was jealousy.
Because that was the one thing of your brother's that you couldn't make your own.
So you took it from him.
Hey George!
"Come on, wake up!"
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
Was her father here?
Yes.
Heasked meifiwasafaggot.
You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
What was my orientation?
What did you say?
That I'm into men.
Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me jf I like men or women?
Who cares?
"Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches""."
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"""
"in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
Her life and half of humanity.
If the Nazis find that door they will come to the present.
and obtain weapons and modern technology.
Do you know what that would mean?
They will win the second World War.
and they will eliminate anyone who doesn't conform to their ideas.
You don't have to tell me.
"I have experience in that area, I assure you."
What are you going to do with me?
We'll figure it out.
Now leave.
May I take the photo?
(ANGUSTIAS) May I come in?
-Like you need permission.
Do we know what will happen to him if he returns to his time?
No.
I'm trying to locate Espínola.
I call him and it cuts off or goes straight to the machine.
-Espínola?
Things must be bad...
Sorry about the wait.
We weren't expecting you so soon.
Typical.
The guy who brought us must have a date later.
He's crazy.
"We call him ""Offroader""."
"So, how's 2015?"
Good...
"I hope it's better than now, when there's nothing to eat."
"We're headed that way, don't doubt it."
And then they say that humanity is evolving.
Evolving my ass. (SCRAPING)
"It's my ship, Mr. Spock."
I should be there.
- We can't even get at them.
"- Nor can they at us, at the moment."
Not unless they move their original position.
That intervening high ground.
You remember the layout of this place?
The arsenal?
About 100 yards in that direction.
But after an attack as thorough as this one...
I'll risk it.
Kirk here.
Report.
"Captain, are you all right?"
Never mind about me.
What about the ship?
We returned fire with all phaser banks.
Negative against its deflector screen.
- Arm your photon torpedoes.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Arm photon torpedoes.
Stand by.
Any identification on the attacking vessel?
"No, sir."
Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're familiar with.
We can't get visual contact.
She's too far away.
"Mr. Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on."
"Photon torpedoes locked on, captain."
Fire all banks.
"All banks fired, sir."
Sulu.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Fandor!
Open up!
"Of course, the wires have been cut."
What has happened?
You're in such a mess!
It is impossible for Fantomas to leave this room.
I have the same opinion.
Who are you?
"Inspector Juve, police."
I thought you were dead!
"I was such a bore in the next world with my stories of Fantômas, that they sent me back to Earth."
You feel better?
"Okay, okay."
I tried to help.
And someone hit me on the head.
So it's you who entered first?
Obviously since my room is the closest to yours.
Why do you say that Fantômas has not come out of this room?
He was able to leave by the window.
The glass is broken.
And his mask is hooked.
I can assure you that Fantômas did not escape through this window.
Why try to deny the obvious?
The evidence?
"You know, sir, that you're in the fourth floor, that there is no ledge or balcony, that unless proven otherwise, nobody saw Fantomas fly."
He only smashed the glass to give the change and delude us.
If not by the window so how did he get out?
"In any case, not by the door either."
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break.
She's drunk.
"As soon as something happens, you automatically make them out to be saints."
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup.
They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
"The woman is no angel, believe me."
They talked about their rotten kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts.
But that their kids still didn't pay any attention.
"When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy."
I don't know if I could live like that!
"God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?"
Karen...
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
"Because he wanted to get away from her, that's why."
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail?
Nigger stickup men.
Know why they get caught?
"Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen."
"Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie."
Come here.
"It's not like that, Nate."
"Look, I know you and I haven't talked very much."
And I'm sorry about that.
But that's just fall out from your dad and me.
"I know you're going through some tough times so, if you need anything..."
"Well, let me ask you something."
"You played basketball in high school, right?"
- Only for a little while.
- You didn't enjoy it?
What are you kidding me?
I loved it!
But there was no pressure then.
And then I didn't love it so much anymore.
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.
So then you just walked away?
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.
"It's just a game, Nate."
Not a life.
Hey spirit girl.
That cheerleading thing always throws me off.
What?
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it's just kind of our thing.
- Oh cool.
- What's up?
"So, um, I need some advice."
About Nathan.
I don't know if its crossing a line.
"Okay, funny wasn't what I was going for but.."
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess
"I'm everybody's go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?"
If it's too weird then...
"We visited so many pool halls that day and night, I couldn't begin to remember them all."
Barbara's 24 hours were about up... that is...
until your figured our pool bets.
"According to my calculations, you owe me through dinnertime, which is 6:00 p.m. in Bayonne."
Right.
My paranoia was in full bloom.
"Every time we came out of one of those pool halls, the blue sedan was cruising by."
"Even after we switched from the bus to the car, his tailing didn't improve."
It was almost like he wanted to be spotted.
Barbara?
Hmm?
Are you a girl who gets nervous in a car?
Never.
Wah!
"Barbara,"
I'm going to the bathroom.
"In two minutes, you go to the bathroom."
But I don't have to go to the bathroom.
"Please, go to the bathroom."
But I...
I don't have to go to the bathroom.
Please.
Okay.
But I don't have to.
"When somebody drives a car that tries too hard to be average... and sports a haircut with white sidewalls, government."
But why would the government care about Barbara's missing fiancé?
That's funny.
Higgins usually has the dogs greet me.
"Yeah, me too."
"Except today he was in a really, really good mood."
Kept laughing and saying something about busing.
"Why don't you make yourself at home, T.C.?"
- Not too far.
You've been saying that for miles.
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?
"Tell me what this new breakfast place is, and I'll be quiet."
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.
Is it in this town or the next?
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?
Didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?
Right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.
"See, so the boycott's legit."
- Wait.
Stop.
"- Look, it's Michael Landon."
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.
We were being followed.
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.
Now you'll believe me when I say the furniture moved itself.
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?
I was wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again.
It's not like they have any other use.
I've almost nailed Ramble On.
I have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull back.
John Bonham had that same problem.
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.
- (farmers):
Ready!
I say we shoot whatever it is and ask the questions after!
- (farmers cheering)
- You pull a stunt like that and it'd be murder.
"I'll personally see to it that you all bloody hang for it, no matter who pulls the trigger."
She killed a man and won't get away with it as long as I'm standing.
"Night will fall soon, that's when she's likely to move."
Ready the torches!
"You'll not be readying anything until I say so, got it?"
Right then.
Each of you will pair up with a constable.
"Crabtree, you talk to that farmer."
"You, stick with me!"
♪♪♪ (indistinct chatter)
- Keep your eyes open!
- Yes.
Do you see that trail?
"Ah, George, there you are!"
- Sir.
- I need you to come with me.
"The girl, Fen, she's likely to flee from the light of the torches."
"But then, sir, how will we see?"
- With these.
- Good gracious!
"Now, George, if you were trying to get away, which direction would you be likely to go in?"
"- Sir, I would follow the river."
- Exactly.
(door closing)
So you have something?
Not yet.
I need more information on Roland.
"We shall see you at Barton Park, I hope."
Next time Sir John gives one of his hops. (CHUCKLES)
"Allow me to escort you to the carriage, Mrs Dashwood."
"Thank you, Colonel."
Marianne is still rather weak.
"And Miss Marianne, of course."
Your mother's as good a hand at that game as I am.
(LAUGHS)
"Thank you, Colonel Brandon."
"I wish you a good journey, ladies."
"Dear Colonel, thank you for your kindness."
"How good it is to see the sun, after what Shakespeare calls the furious winter's rages."
"Oh, my little love."
We shall always be grateful to the people at Cleveland.
Mr Palmer's library is full of great books.
I wonder if he has ever read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare.
I should think he bought them to make a fine show.
I have formed a plan.
I shall enter upon a course of serious study.
I shall rise at six and divide every moment until dinner between music and reading.
I dare say Colonel Brandon will advise me as to my reading.
"Yes, I'm sure he will."
I long to sit down at my own dear pianoforte.
My plan shall keep me busy.
We shall have no time for regrets.
(PIANO PLAYING)
It is over now.
"Elinor, do not grieve, that moment had to come."
I'm glad it is over.
- Is it?
- At least we are talking about him.
- We should have done so before.
"If they ain't got your back, and you find you somebody else, 'cause it--"
She--she done been up there.
Look.
I'm saying--I'm gonna show you how she ain't have my back.
"I'm gonna tell you, okay?"
"We're in the Bahamas, people."
Physically how she didn't have my back.
We're in the Bahamas.
"Now, I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing, swimming."
I said I shouldn't be doing it.
I didn't say I couldn't do it.
I said I shouldn't have been doing it.
"I was in the water, swimming."
I swam all the way out to where the buoys were.
"I was just swimming like, ""A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha."""
"I looked in the water, and I seen this big brown thick thing with fins and teeth coming towards my pinky toe."
"Oh, it was a shark."
I kid you not.
"And I was trying to get her attention, because when you're in a relationship and you're in danger, you're supposed to have safety signals amongst one another that you can read, right?"
"So I went just like this, ""Unh, unh, unh."""
"That means, ""Bitch, get the lifeguard."""
That's what that means.
"But she ain't understand it, right?"
So she's on the shore thinking I'm swimming fast for her benefit.
"So she's like, ""Whoo, yes!"
"Baby, go faster!"""
"Whoo!"""
"That's how she sounds, I swear to God."
"""Whoo!"""
"I got back to the shore, I was like,"
"""Excuse me, did you not realize."
"""I almost got killed by a shark?"
"First off, I'm on my own after college, which is why I work so hard, and why I take opportunities when they come my way."
Not all of us get to live off a trust fund for the rest of our lives.
I'm not gonna be able to do that either.
Of course you are.
No.
My dad told me earlier.
He lost everything.
So I'm giving him my trust fund.
Why didn't you tell me this was going on?
Because I was embarrassed.
You're right.
I've never had to worry about money.
I feel stupid even complaining about it.
"I mean, other people have real problems."
"Sebastian, this is real."
And you shouldn't feel bad talking about it.
Are you sure you want to give your trust fund to him?
I don't think I can abandon him.
I guess I just don't have that killer instinct.
Aren't you worried he's gonna lose the money?
Yes.
But you're still gonna give it to him?
"Well, I already invested $25,000 in the company."
Too late to get that back.
But...
"Yeah, I'll give the rest to him."
"I mean, it's his money anyway."
He made it.
What will you do?
Will you have to move out?
I don't know.
"I mean, this place is rent-controlled."
"When you worked f or Martinelli, did he take stuff home briefcase, papers or did he leave them locked up in his office?"
"I don't know, ex cept he kept my contract in his office."
Why?
"Last night, Louis the bar man had a letter f or me that Johnny gave him."
- What did it say?
- l don't know.
Martinelli got it.
- How do you know?
"- When your phone call woke me up Louis was in my room, lying on the other bed with a broken neck."
"- Oh, Rip."
- Yeah.
I'm a guy that likes to get his mail.
Martinelli would have destroyed it by now.
"No, he'd want to read it first."
Johnny would have written it in code.
"My guess is, he's still trying to figure it out. i'm going after it."
- Not back there?
- Yeah.
I just had my f riend Baretto on the phone.
He gave me the name of a safe expert.
He was so good the law took a little slice out of his life.
- He's retired.
Lives in this town.
- What good is--?
I don't think Johnny killed your husband.
- Why?
- l knew him like my own birthmark.
"Rip, there's something I didn't tell the coroner because Johnny wouldn't let me."
I was right there when it happened.
"Johnny was af raid they'd blame me, tie us both up."
Ex-nightclub singer and young college professor murder her husband.
- But that wasn't the way it was.
What happened?
Nothing.
-What happened?
-l just got scared.
Got the keys?
"What happened, Karen?"
"I just got scared, Henry. lt's okay."
Are you all right?
-Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
So your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
The people who have cared for you all of your life.
And they always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
I got there 15 minutes early and Jimmy was already there.
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat him out to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fuckin' phone."
"Now you understand, huh?"
It's going to be okay.
I think you got a good chance of beating the case.
"Well, you know that kid from the city we were talking about?"
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
No..
Who is he?
Tell me
Who is he?
Will you torture her when asked to act like her husband as she got a doubt?
She is my wife and my everything.
Will you put your hands on her?
I will shoot you
Stop it.
"Vasu, that is.."
She is..
- No need!
You have cheated me for all these years.
Do not try any further.
Tomorrow is Rahul's marriage.
"Once that is over, you just not need to resign for all your designations in the company, but also withdraw your Legislative Council nomination."
"Else, I will have to open up."
Mind it!
Thanks bro!
Nothing more and nothing less.
All have smashed it up.
"Subramanyam sir, you were awesome."
Medal is guaranteed for you.
Thank you..
Hello..
He is unconscious as he was tortured for many days.
What is the condition sir?
Doctor said he will be alright within 2 - 3 days.
We had known about Marthand from the person who hacked IB server and arrested him.
Your under arrest..
Marthand changing as the approver has said it all in detail about the Grand Palace Killings.
Duplicate medicines have started releasing into market by Jayaraj under label of Vasundhara Pharmaceuticals
"Would you just name it, for God's sakes?"
What is it?
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.
What about your daughter?
No.
Why?
Have you ever heard of exorcism?
"Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit."
"It's been pretty much discarded these days except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment."
"But it, uh, has worked, in fact although not for the reasons they think, of course."
It's purely force of suggestion.
"The, uh-"
- The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it so in that same way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor.
Is that it?
Karl?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
-What?
-A man to see you.
- What man?
"Might your daughter remember, perhaps if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night?"
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."
"""his younger sister, before he dies."
"""please come and see my father."
"""sincerely yours, clark."""
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, Iet's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
-How could he be my big brother?
-It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
"I know... what you mean, but...."
Guess it's about the right time to eat some kidney beans.
real stubborn.
Yeah.
"Actually, I'm supposed to have drinks"
"With the woman from CNN, and I owe it to her"
To tell her my decision face to face.
Okay.
All right.
"Well, uh, tomorrow night, then."
Absolutely.
Blair.
Hey.
You never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday.
What are you doing?
I could ask you the same question.
Does Serena know you're trying to pull off plaid?
"Seriously, Blair, I expected Chuck"
"To go back to his old habits after your breakup,"
But I'd actually thought you'd grown up a little.
Whatever do you mean?
Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side
Two days in a row?
It pretty much looks like
"You're pretending to be a Columbia student, and not that"
"I care much about what Jenny Humphrey does these days,"
"But I saw that smackdown on ""Gossip Girl."" she was dealing drugs."
It's called an intervention.
"It's called you going back to plotting and conniving,"
"Okay, and that's the Waldorf equivalent"
"Of Chuck going around, sleeping with every call girl in the city"
And avoiding any kind of emotional contact.
Okay.
So I'm pretending to be a student here.
But it's only because I'm living a nightmare.
"Oh, no."
No way.
Things have gone too far already.
"Don't tell me, Samantha Josephine, you want to go to a lawyer, get the money and run, now."
That's exactly what I wanna do.
You have no sense of timing.
I have sense enough to know-
"You know nothing because if you did, you'd realise that that money cannot be transferred all at once."
It's gonna look overly suspicious.
How many times do I have to tell you?
The play must be performed one act at a time.
"How many times do I have to tell you that the longer we wait, the more chance we have of getting caught?"
"She's right, Joel."
"- I don't wanna hear from you, Rita."
- Why not?
Because any decisions to be made are mine to make.
Mine.
Is that clear enough?
Mommy.
Mommy.
"- Thank God, you're all right."
"- Oh, darling."
"Oh, yes, we're fine."
- You were extraordinary.
"- Oh, all in a day's work."
Welcome home.
"Well, I really must congratulate you, both of you."
"I guess the words ""brave"" and ""daring"" are appropriate."
"- Thank you, Blake, we appreciate that."
- Yes.
"Oh, Alexis, I'd like to talk to you for a moment, if I may."
- It's rather important.
I was spellbound... but she said it all...
I even tried to get away...
"""but when I looked back, there she was, right in front of me"""
"""Then I smiled and she smiled back;"
"when I took a step, she came along"""
"""Then we became breathless, and a moment stood stilled"""
"And then, we were in love"
That's our love-story
That's our life-story
"3 months, 28 days and 8 hours ago we fell in love"
You're crazy
Why do you drag him everywhere?
He won't leave us alone
What does that mean?
- You're bananas
I'll be home by eight.
"Yes, I'm with Jai."
Brian is also with us
Why talk to your mother like that?
Like how?
So irritably...?
Because she irritates me
"At times, I hate her."
Maybe Because of the familiarity?
"When you're far from home, you realise... what mother means, what a family means"
This monkey is hovering around all the time... particularly when I'm with you
"Yes, because of you"
You're seeing my parents today
After we drop Brian.
Won't take long
Now smile and give an okay
Watch!
Serve them!
I knew it was a fish from the beginning!
Thank you.
- Here.
"- Don't let anyone see, alright?"
"- Here, take it."
- We only got it today.
That's absurd!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Bastard!
Jean Louis!
My mother told me I'd find you in Capri.
So what are you doing in this corner of the world?
It's my duty to come here for the revolution.
"Ah, yes, I had forgotten about Count Marx."
And I had forgotten how deep your cynicism runs.
Yours and that of your entire generation.
"Come Jean Louis, you wouldn't be a student of Marx... if his blood wasn't much bluer than yours."
And where is it written that you have to be a proletariat in order to fight for justice?
You don't understand the youth of today... you can't imagine how different they are.
You wouldn't recognize the world that will come out of this world.
The imperialists and their lackeys will be defeated.
"Hey, Malaparte, Jimmy sends word that he can't come."
He was supposed to bring me a medic.
Did something happen?
"No, no."
He won't be able to come
He wants you to cover for him.
We have to go.
Ciao.
Everyone finished?
Can you believe Kenbo's learning to write?
He's smart and good looking
Good bye
See you tomorrow
Clinic
Isn't he going to inherit the martial arts academy?
"Yes, his father was a grand fencing master"
A samurai teaching kids to write...
It's not right
You... should investigate
He may be have ties to Kira
I warned you about this
"Even scattered, it's risk y with too many of us in town"
"All right Not to worry, it's nothing"
Though I can't heal much more than this
"Soza san, is this the first time you've met Kichiemon?"
Yes
I'm Kichiemon
I'm Aoki Soza-emon
"Soza san has come from up north, to avenge his father"
I see
"Revenge, huh..."
"It's been over two and a half years now, with no leads..."
"Two and a half years, I'm sorry"
But why here?
Any special reason?
These places often shelter strangers
A good place to seek my enemy...
Strangers?
"Master Aoki, what do you do for fun?"
Fun?
"It has, like, Compressed some minerals."
"Gold likes to travel,"
But gold gets stuck with Other heavies pretty easily.
So we're thinking All we have to do.
Is jack up one of these Boulders.
And that might give us a clue On where the gold deposits are.
"So we got to boulder here,"
But I got to get some straps Around the boulder.
Zeke will try To float the massive stone.
Using straps and an air bag.
I don't do a lot of Boulder floating so
I don't know How this is gonna go down.
"All right, Just don't be under the boulder."
When you lift it.
But hoisting A 200-pound rock 35 feet down.
In the bering sea Is easier said than done.
Is that Enough slack?
Yes.
I think I'm gonna try to lift On it and see what happens.
Whoa.
Off the coast Of remote sledge island...
I think I'm gonna try to Lift on it and see what Happens.
Zeke tenhoff Is trying to pull.
A 200-pound boulder from The depths of the bering sea.
Whoop.
Whoa.
I see it.
There it is.
Are you okay?
"Well, I just Lost a float bag."
Looks like you didn't Strap it on good enough.
"Um, well, I'm just gonna Look under this boulder."
"Now, Joseph, we heard your testimony this morning."
-Was it true?
-It was all true.
And you claim that your sister killed your stepfather... because he grabbed her.
He was a strong man.
We were both afraid.
If Lucas was as strong as you and everybody else has said... how could your sister possibly overpower him?
She was madder than he was and scareder.
"Lucas was 195 lbs... your sister, 11O lbs."
Did she sneak up behind him... and hit him with that piece of firewood when he wasn't looking?
"No, sir."
Were you watching every second?
"Well, I might 've looked away once or twice."
Did you see Selena hit him the first blow?
I don't know.
is there any doubt in your mind as to how that 1st blow was struck?
I...
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
Joseph... you said that you told your sister to bury your stepfather.
-That's right.
She didn't want to.
-I see.
"And how old were you when you told her, when she did what you wanted?"
About 8.
In other words... a19 year-old girl didn't know what to do with the body... until an 8 year-old boy told her.
"-Yes, sir."
-I have no further questions.
No questions.
"You may step down, Joseph."
I wish to recall Selena Cross to the stand.
"Miss Cross, yesterday you told the jury that your stepfather... disappeared from home a year and a half before you killed him."
Now Oscar should be given for your performance.
I need to look at face of Vasu and my son once.
Open the box.
- Sir please..
I said open the box..
- Can't bear seeing this.
Open it..
Open it!
Deepak!
How was the shock?
Have you enjoyed or not?
Are you the Police guy?
"- What is this agony, sir?"
"Did you think about killing madam who gave you a great life, her son and my sister?"
It is wrong.
It is very wrong..
- Meaning..
You fool!
How can I let all this happen when I am there?
Sorry sir!
How can I hold your collar?
I would make you hit and run on the streets.
"I will exuviate your blood, bastard!"
You had shown only dual characters so many years.
I showed you dual role.
Not understand?
It was me who hit on your businesses as the Police officer.
It was me who exposed your flashback to madam by joining as the PA.
Your son has died for the sins you committed.
"After knowing about you, I thought you were a villain."
I now came to know that you are not even that.
I hate myself for being the wife to a fellow like you all these years.
The legend is beautiful.
That ship is also very amazing.
"I can go in there, right?"
But how come this ship is here like this?
Because it's bewitched.
"If you become bewitched to a beautiful place, you become like this."
Have you ever been bewitched?
"Of course, I have."
I think you know.
"♬ When I look at you, everything stops ♬"
♬ I'm not sure when it started ♬
"Now that I think about it, I still haven't heard your response."
Have you been well?
Are you still sexy in the surgery room?
I think you misunderstood.
I didn't come here to do the volunteer work with good intention.
A higher up dragged me down for a little bit.
The place he sent me to was here.
"And now, I don't do surgeries anymore."
Looks like I didn't have enough skills for surgeries.
I will go back soon.
I will have to go back to the place I was in after I go back.
I am very busy.
I see.
♬ My tear's confession ♬
♬ Your love which flutters in the wind ♬
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
"♬ Whenever, wherever you are ♬"
Okay.
Here.
"When you come to a place like this, you eat like this."
You will have the memory of this taste forever.
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
"Hi, Stuart."
"Hi, Sheldon."
Pardon me...
Excuse me...
"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater with a character like Stuart is repellent.
"No offense, Stuart."
None taken.
"Although ""repellent"" is kind of a... kind of a strong word."
"I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
"Um, again..."
"Stuart, please."
You're being rude.
Anything else?
I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
I'm listening.
"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise,"
"I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as ""not my girlfriend."""
Interesting.
Now try it without the quadruple negative.
You're being impossible.
"Hi, Stuart."
Fine.
Amy... will you be my girlfriend?
Yes.
"Well, that's enough of that."
Sorry to interrupt.
"Once again, we blasted the nasal passages of the city clean of the cloning mucus of evil."
Now we can all breathe free and easy and smell the lilacs in bloom.
"Hello, aroma!"
Ahh...
- Atchoo!
"- Uh, I'll get the soup."
Too hot!
Too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me;
my heart dances
But not for joy; not joy
"Go, play. boy."
Play
"Thy mother plays and I play, too but so disgraced a part."
"How now, boy?"
What has smudged thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine.
"- Come, Captain, we must be neat."
"- I am like you, they say."
"Why, that's some comfort."
"Go, play, Mamillius."
"'A sudden madness had struck down Leontes, the King of Sicilia."
"'In the twinkling of an eye, it had turned him against those he loved best."
"'He became convinced that his wife, Hermione, 'and his childhood friend, Polixones, King of Bohemia, were lovers 'and that Polixenes was the father of her unborn child. '"
"- What, Camille, there?"
"- Ay, my good lord."
"Ha' you not seen, Camille - but that's past doubt - that my wife is slippery?"
You never spoke what did become you less than this.
Is whispering nothing?
Leaning cheek to cheek
Latest printout of the class attendance
Something's wrong with the computer!
Who got the printout?
You or I...?
Jags!
Guess what happened?
- My attendance is 90 percent
Never mind and pay up the internet cafe. 150 bucks
You took pocket money five days ago.
Pay your obeisances
Hold on... here's a fifty
Also keep this coin
What do I do with this buck?
"Son, that coin... was the first token your father placed at our shrine"
You're always running out of money.
Keep the coin.
It augur well for you
Good-luck coin...?
Yes
Hi Jai!
How are you?
How is Om?
How is Ma?
She must be standing right there to hear my letter
Stop chattering.
Read on
America is a great country.
People here are very hard-working
This is a land full of opportunities if you want to make it in life
All I miss are Ma's love and home-cooked food
Tell Ma that my taste buds are always tingling to memories of her dishes
"Jags, take a look, is Ma in tears?"
This is 2007.
And I have a friend who worked for the Irish chart-compiling company.
"He said, 200 copies, if you buy them in the correct stores that are chart-tracking that month."
It will get you to 27?
"That's all you need for 27, yeah."
So I recorded a song in two hours.
"It was called Orange, about ladies who wear too much tan and we burned it."
Rude.
It's rude.
"Oh, really?"
But you know...
I love a tan.
"You know the one that stops there on the jawline, where it's just complete whiteness."
"What, you mean me about twice a month?"
"Hey, really?"
"Yeah, there's no shame in it."
Sometimes you put it on when you're a bit drunk.
You end up with one big orange hand.
Yeah.
My first husband had...
An orange cock.
LAUGHTER
My first husband had no true idea of my actual ethnicity until well after we got married.
He just thought I was kind of a Mediterranean dusky beauty until about six months.
"He just pulled back the duvet one day and went, ""Fuck!"""
"And I was kind of like a pale blue colour, like a pale, white, porridgy colour."
"""Hello, I'm from Cumbria."" That's exactly it."
"Sorry, I get..."
"So we recorded this song, we burnt 200 copies on my laptop and made a cover."
You just need a barcode.
It isn't very hard to get.
And registered me as a label.
STEVE:
You got anything?
Nothing.
Keep looking.
There's got to be something here that's gonna tell us who hired this guy.
Guys?
I think I got something.
What?
"Okay, so it looks like"
Kroll was hired over the Tor Network.
What is that?
It's kind of like a shadow Internet.
"Some people call it ""the Dark-net."""
"It was originally created by the Navy, but nowadays it's utilized mostly by criminals because it allows them to be completely anonymous."
So tracing an I.P.?
"Is not gonna happen, but... here comes the good news."
"According to these e-mails,"
Kroll wouldn't take the Cutler job unless the client revealed himself.
And did they?
Not at first.
But they came around.
Here-- looks like they sent their last message outside of the network.
And that I.P. we can trace.
ABBY:
But I liked John.
Why would I kill him?
"Well, maybe you liked him more than you let on."
"You wanted John to take you away from your secret little escort life, but he had no intentions of ending his marriage."
"A woman scorned, Abby."
It's the oldest motive there is.
CATHERINE:
These e-mails?
Ok I already told Becca but since you asked... girls...
Jill you can just tell me later.
Stacy I'm so sorry...
I don't mean to spoil your special little moment.
But I have a huge announcement to make...
I'm getting married!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Do you love it?
It was the most amazing night you guys.
I don't want to just be your girlfriend anymore!
It's not that I don't...
love you...
"It's not fair, I can' take this limbo!"
I know...
You either marry me or you leave me!
It was the most romantic night of my life.
"What can I say, he's the best."
You've got to be kidding me!
"Drew, I'm sorry but he was hitting on me less than two months ago."
"Ok... he wasn't hitting on you, Hallie."
He was flirting with you.
"Guys are allowed to flirt, it's a human condition."
It's natural.
You think everyone is flirting with you.
I don't know I just think it's weird if a guy is ultra flirtatious... and in a committed relationship.
And not to mention that he's in the business.
Men in the entertainment industry are instinctively douche bags.
No?
No I like Drew.
I don't think he's a douche bag.
Well...
Who came up with the term douche bag anyway?
That's not what I'm saying.
"Yeah,it is.That's exactly what he's saying."
"Go ahead,man,you kick his white ass."
Shut up!
I'd just like to come home once and not hear doors being slammed.
She's 12.
"I had a friend who got so tired of it, he actually took his daughter's door off the hinges."
It's like a battleground every night.
She's trying to manipulate the situation.
"She asks me if she can sleep at a friend's,I say no."
"She asks you,you say yes."
What's wrong with this picture?
I didn't know the parents weren't gonna be there.
But I did.All you had to do was ask me.
"Oh,so now I have to ask your permission to make a decision about my daughter?"
Come on.
That's not what I'm saying.
Ok.
"So,when are the depositions?"
Friday.
I get the pleasure of defending your ex.
Is that what this is about?
Wyatt did the right thing.So did you.
Yeah.
That's a great defense.
I'll remember that.
"Daniel,come on."
Don't walk away.We have to talk.
Don't make me stop this rig... sometimes this job just seems like a job.
"These depositions go wrong on friday, we'll all be looking for new ones."
"Hence,the bad mood."
"Lawyers expect you to lie, so you tell them the truth and throw 'em off their game."
It's a marked trail.
It's a trail.
So we're going through The middle of bum.
The only trail there.
Those are a lot Of mights and maybes.
We might find a trail.
It may be marked.
There's supposed To be a path.
"When they find The access point to the claim,"
They'll have to Bring in a dredge.
"Built specifically To launch from riverbanks,"
One that brad's commandeered For the mission.
You know what?
We really should've came here One day of scouting.
Without the boat And everything.
It doesn't matter.
It's here now.
"We need it here, Regardless of what we do."
"I know a few miners around Town, And my buddy let me use."
His dredge.
"- Good, take it forward."
- There we go.
I bring a lot of Different things.
"You know, always trying to Inspire the other family Member."
That's what We try and do.
"You know, maybe we do it In an unorthodox way,"
But we're trying To inspire each other.
"To become better citizens, Better people overall."
And probably better Gold dredgers.
"Now, hopefully, The river claim."
Is only an atv ride away... find us the easiest Road down there.
Or the kellys' plan Could be washed away.
It's signed.
- You like the Bulls?
You ever go?
- Not often.
"Oh, okay."
So we're doing some stuff on Atlantor.
Some stuff?
"Yeah, stuff, DA Stuff."
"And because we're great investigators, we discovered you are too."
"I'm not investigating, I'm trying to get them to stop building this."
"Cool, to protect the neighborhood."
I like it there.
I grew up in Bridgeport.
- Mr. Dumanjik...
- Bob.
Are you going to tell me what this is about?
You mean about the grand jury?
Excuse me?
The grand jury we impaneled to investigate Atlantor.
lnvestigate what about Atlantor?
"Well, that would be telling."
Wait a minute.
A grand jury is investigating Atlantor.
And I was hoping you'd be happy about that.
This is strange.
You can't tell me?
What did they do?
I was hoping since you've been developing evidence for your own civil case that maybe you could share what you've found in a neighborly way.
I... this is... you're going to have to tell me more about this.
"I have all sorts of constraints, confidentiality issues..."
And your ex-husband is the architect.
- What do you want?
Just then...
Seo Yoon Jae's spirit thought his body to be dead and selfishly rushed into my body.
Yoon Jae...is not the kind of person to selfishly take someone else's body.
Whatever.
"Without any choice, my spirit went into Seo Yoon Jae's body."
This all happened because Seo Yoon Jae went into the wrong body.
Yoon Jae is a person of discretion.
He's not someone to make mistakes about his place like that.
Whatever.
Whatever!
This one has to leave...
There will be some sort of a solution whether it be just another switch-a-roo.
Yoon Jae...
How did this happen?
Why did you go to a place like that?
What?
A place like that?
I don't like..places like this either!
"Yoon Jae doesn't drink carbonated drinks, so can you drink something else?"
What?
"This isn't your body, but Yoon Jae's body."
"Until things go back to normal, I hope that you treat it preciously."
Preciously?
How?
"Just like Yoon Jae's always done, when you're thirsty, drink water instead of carbonated beverages."
Also the weather is chilly and this is thin.
Don't you have anything thicker and warmer?
You weren't even examined thoroughly earlier...
Oh my...
"Oh my, you're scraped here."
What do we do?
Wait a second.
except to say that we probably don't want to be here when they arrived.
They ?
Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?
"Whatever , man."
Do you got any more cookies ?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
How about this.
"If you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are, and I'll throw in the recipe."
How're you going to do that dead ?
Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague ."
Again?
Yea.
Again.
"Don't worry, I won't move this time."
I'll be right here when you get back.
"I know we have to off this guy coz that's what we got to do, but I don't want to do it until I know why he wants us to do it."
"I mean, something's wrong here."
"What's this, Daze ?"
I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack a truck chucked full of cash and cologne to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.
I want this guy's story but getting it will just make our job harder.
I mean it changes everything.
that's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm.
And for that reason I think we shouldn't talk to him anymore.
That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.
He sure is.
How about those cookies?
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you,"
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
"When Lotus arrives,"
I'll ask Yan to let her sit on this chair.
Then Yan will get the tea by leaps and bounds.
Isn't it great?
That's great!
Am I smart?
"Master, how to kiss her?"
Take a seat.
"When she is all wet, what's next?"
She will be very ugly and she will scream!
"No, no!"
She will get changed!
"Master, how can she get changed in public?"
Look!
This door will lock up automatically when it's closed.
"At the same time, water will flush out from this hole."
"According to human beings' instinct, Lotus will..."
Stuff it with her finger.
"At the same time, another water-column comes from that side."
She will stuff with another finger.
But she can't imagine that... another water-column aims... at her face!
"Master, do you mean it?"
Lotus is so poor then.
She can't seek for any help!
She must be scared and doesn't know what to do.
"In order to stop the water, everyone knows she will... stuff the hole with her tongue."
"That's right, you stand in front of the changing room."
"When it's the right time, remove the hose, move forward and kiss."
So I can kiss her.
Smug calcultation!
"When you hear the bell ringing, go ahead and kiss her."
What's the use of kissing her?
"Oh, my God, this is gonna be so crazy."
Wow.
Has anyone made noise in here yet?
- We get pretty loud.
- Do you?
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, don't be worried about the volume."
- Okay.
- Yeah.
How much has it changed?
- Zero.
"- ""Zero."" Really, zero?"
It was how my parent...
"You know, they wanted to keep it just like they walked into it."
- Yeah.
- And that's what they did.
"They just said ""We're never gonna change..."
"Change it from that experience,"" you know."
Rad!
"Well, I'm going to Pat O'Brien's."
I'll see you guys.
This place is so thick with vibe.
You know?
"You just feel like, the sweat of generations you know, pouring off the walls."
"To see all our gear in there is a trip, you know?"
It's so out of...
It just seemed out of place.
"Like, ""Fuck, I hope we don't rattle the fucking building down or whatever, with the volume,"" you know?"
Originally it was built as a Spanish tavern.
And then over the years it's been a lot of things.
It was a photo studio where most of uptown aristocracy would come downtown and get their photos taken.
So you'd go into people's houses on St. Charles Avenue and you'd see their portraits in their Mardi Gras gowns and they're in the courtyard of Preservation Hall.
It's a bad idea.
It's just gonna alienate her more.
Georgie...
I'm getting complaints!
People are furious!
You're turning down everyone's offer?
Why?
They're too low!
"I told you, they go to the highest bidder."
My client offered you twelve hundred dollars.
That's way higher than any meat buyer's gonna give you!
What is wrong with you?
!
Will said your father loved those horses!
How can you just kill them?
Those horses killed my father.
I understand you're under fire from the CPS.
It must be very difficult.
You should know since you're the one who instigated the entire thing!
I don't see how you can show your face at our door.
You took the truth and you twisted it into total lies.
I believe I had just cause.
You tried to keep me from seeing my only niece.
"I told you, you wouldn't get away with it."
But...
I can make this all go away.
For a price.
For a price?
"I'm sorry, you're blackmailing us!"
It's hardly blackmail.
"If you want me out of Georgie's life that much, then I believe I deserve a little compensation."
You have my number.
"Fredo, you're nothing to me now."
"Not a brother, not a friend."
"I don't want to know you, or what you do."
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
"When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there."
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.
There's more people than at a ballgame in here.
"-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!"
-Frankie Five-Angels...
This committee will come to order!
"-State your name, please."
-Frank PentangeIi.
-Where were you born?
"-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo."
Where do you live now?
I Iive in an army barracks with the FBI guys.
We have here a witness that will further testify to michael corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling.
This witness has had no buffer between himself and michael corleone.
He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against michael corleone.
-Senator.
"-Thank you, Chairman."
Mr. PentangeIi.
Mr. PentangeIi.
Were you a member of the CorIeone family?
"Did you serve under Caporegime, Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather?"
I never knew any Godfather.
I have my own family.
"Mr. PentangeIi, you..."
You are contradicting your own sworn statement.
What else can we do?
If they fight we must fight with them.
"And does it matter, after all, who wins?"
Was that ever really the question?
Will almighty God ask that question in the end?
"Police Department, zone one."
Sergeant Roberts.
The Polish Hill Strangler has claimed a fourth victim.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn was recovered from the Ohio River.
"Police had been alerted to the crimes by the killer,   who taunts them by playing the song ""Little Red Riding Hood""."
The police brutality trial of Detective Jimmy Detillo is over.
Detillo was convicted for the beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma.
The key to the conviction   was the testimony of Detillo's partner and cousin Thomas Hardy.
Hardy testified that his partner used unwarranted force.
"Come on, son, we're gonna be late for the policeman's ball."
- You've got to face him sometime.
- I feel like an asshole.
Maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
- I had you as a role model.
- You got that from your mother.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
"- Yeah, we're going out tomorrow."
What's the latest on Little Red Riding Hood?
"We get close, he slips away."
"I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop."
Maybe an ex-cop.
"Uncle Nick thinks so, too."
- Did you talk to him about Jimmy?
- We talked around it.
- I'm not in the militia.
- What's going on here?
- Keep out of this.
"No, don't do that."
"In my hospital, we don't usually leave the injured lying on the floor."
- Put him back on the drip.
"- Today, he's been lucky."
But I won't always be here to keep our men back.
"It's my job to help people, regardless of their political camp."
Does that mean you don't distinguish between victims and executioners?
He needs an operation now.
Do you have an operating theatre?
"Yes, but we don't have a doctor any more."
If you could assist me...
I can.
I studied medicine.
Our friend Benítez obviously isn't losing any time.
Right.
They'll soon be able to get supplies from the north again.
He's a cunning old fox.
I wonder how they managed to finish the bridge so quickly.
We must blow that thing up.
Look at that.
"Hey, that lorry was part of the ammunition transport."
"- Yes, we couldn't be more lucky."
- There'll be some fireworks!
All we need to do is attach the explosives.
"Hey, leave that bag here and go and meet Emiliano."
Stop!
Get out of the car!
"Come on, hurry!"
Listen.
Did you wipe it off well?
Kim Young Joo's blood too...
You should wipe it off as well.
The one who killed Kim Young Joo was Cheon Jae Man.
Did you know?
You're no different from Cheon Jae Man.
He didn't kill those agents in the special task force himself either.
He merely borrowed the hands of others.
You dare put me in the same category as Cheon Jae Man?
!
The last person to be punished.
Is President Choi Eung Chan.
The cruelest revenge you talked about...
Was it this?
Making me kill my real father by my own hands.
You've had quite a lot of fun these past 28 years.
Taking me away from my mom...
Making me believe someone else is my real father...
"Now, you're telling me to take revenge on my real father?"
That revenge...
I don't think I can do it.
Is it because he is your father by blood?
No.
"After becoming close to him, I saw he was an amazing President."
That amazing President you talk about...
Do you think he really got to that seat cleanly?
Choi Eung Chan...
I look forward to seeing your expression when you find out what he's really like.
Don't look forward to seeing my expression.
Things won't happen the way you want.
What Father wants...
That won't happen.
"I've got nobody to spend them on, except you."
Now you won't let me have any fun at all.
"Oh, but i'd love to have that necklace."
I've always been hungry for pretty things.
All right.
We'll form a corporation.
Josie mansfield and company.
"Still talking big, mr."
Fisk.
"Oh, show business ain't any different from any other business- you can't stay in it unless you make money out of it."
I'll build you up like i would a big corporation.
"Your assets are looks, talent, and ambition."
You'll be a fine investment.
Even corporations can fail.
Not mine.
Not jim fisk's.
I've got the golden touch.
I got it here.
No.
I think you've got it there.
"Oh, jim, may i see you a moment?"
What's on your mind?
"Well, uh... oh, don't mind josie."
She's one of the firm.
There isn't anything you can't say in front of her.
I'm afraid i'll have to see you alone.
Will you excuse me?
"Old man drew's outside, and he's hopping mad."
"The madder you get a goose, the easier it is to pull his tailfeathers."
But what good's a handful of tailfeathers if you lose a golden egg?
"Keep him here in our henhouse, i'll be with you in a minute."
"You know, josie, i've got a feeling in my bones that you're going to bring us luck."
I want to be married to you.
Gregory... you are married to me.
"Right... that's right, that's right, yeah, right."
What?
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
"- Oh, that's all right, it'll pass, just hold on to me."
"Rose, don't ever leave me again."
I'm not leaving you...
I love you.
"I couldn't stand being away from you, it was killing me."
"Ah, I'm so glad."
"I don't care if you ARE pretty, I love you anyway."
"Listen, everything's gonna drop as I get older, and I'm gaining weight as we SPEAK."
"Well, that's comforting."
"- Get in, Lady."
"- Oh, no, not you again!"
- You know this guy?
- He's a good man.
"I can't believe this, your windows are still broke?"
"Complain to the cab company, I got nothing to do with it."
You can see that F of X equals E to Y...
"Times E to the X, which is what we were trying to prove."
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It's beautiful!
"It actually reminds me of a quote by Socrates,"
"""If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition in any degree,"
"""the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition."
"""Measure and symmetry are beauty, and virtue the world over."""
He's cute.
Do you think he's straight?
"Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay."
"It's glorious, isn't it?"
I'm surprised that it arrived so soon.
Yea.
Terrific.
I'll just have a go at the gears.
Then you can take her out for a spin.
"Double-time it, Magnum."
Swimsuit on.
"Mr. Higgins, if you could have it ready by the time Magnum finishes his swim, that would be perfect."
No problem.
"Actually, Magnum, I quite envy you the bike race... because the course cuts through the Austin Memorial Gardens, which are normally off-limits to visitors."
I've been there.
You have?
Yeah.
"Well, Roger wrote about the Austin Gardens a lot, so it was the first place I went when I landed."
He worked there when he first came to the Islands.
Why didn't you tell me this?
I'm your investigator.
I don't know.
"Well, he wasn't there."
They didn't know where he'd gone.
But they said he was wonderful with tropical flowers.
We have got to talk.
"When you've had your swim, then we'll try out the new bike."
"Barbara, I have the feeling you're stringing me along, and it's going to stop now."
What?
You don't think Roger proposed to me?
Oh.!
Or...
Or you think I'm the kind of girl that never gets proposed to.
"- No, that's not what I mean."
"- Well, I'll have you know... that in high school I was voted queen of the Friday night dance... twice."
- Bees.
You know anything about bees?
I know somebody who knows somebody.
Ahem.
"Well, let me just say that I am sorry about your loss and I do accept credit cards."
The facts were these:
"One Kentucky Fitz, wife of Dusty  was the number-one Bee-Girl of Betty's Bees."
"Betty's Bees, trademark, was all the buzz in beauty and well-being  with honey and honey-based moisturizers  anti-aging creams, soaps and lip balms."
"Kentucky was 26 years, 3 weeks, 5 days and 39 minutes old  when found stung to death  behind the wheel of her Betty's Bees Bee Mobile."
- Which one is Kentucky Fitz?
- Biscuits.
- Biscuits?
"- You got biscuits, you got shrimps."
Biscuits.
Shrimps.
- You got something to flip her over?
- Why you gotta flip her over?
Front don't look no different and it ain't like you gonna be having a conversation.
It sure ain't.
Ooh.
Kentucky?
Maybe she's paralyzed from all the bee stings.
I'm just taking in my surroundings.
"Apparently, I'm dead."
- Really?
"Oh, I'm sorry but was your death accidental?"
Was I accidentally swarmed by bees?
No.
I may have been up to some mischief.
Your husband thinks what got you killed was some workplace romance gone sour.
And my husband has a problem with eavesdropping.
There was no romance.
Thank you.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
So are you gonna tell me why you're on the run?
You wouldn't believe me.
I'm not so sure I believe me anymore.
- Try me.
- Promise you won't laugh.
Why would I laugh?
"Okay, two years ago, I'm sittin' at home, watchin' a ball game."
- Dodgers are losing.
- I hate the Dodgers.
- You wanna hear this or not?
- I'm sorry.
"At the same time, on the other side of the city... there's some guy robbing a bank, dressed like a clown."
- A clown?
"- Yes, a clown."
It seems that some jerk had knocked off several banks... in a clown outfit.
"The media, in all of their originality, picked up on this... and labeled him the red-nosed robber."
So I'm coming out of Osco's a couple days later.
There's two cops waiting for me.
"Bang, they haul me in."
- Why would they haul you in?
- Let me get to that.
I was stuck in Sonoma.
The only job I could wrangle was playin' a clown at kids' birthday parties... which wasn't such a bad gig.
"Flexible hours, a lot of free cake."
"One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax, sees the story on the news."
She calls the cops.
"They get a search warrant, crash down the door, find the costume."
- It's all over.
- Did you have to wear those big shoes?
I knew you'd make fun of me.
They're supposed to surrender?
How can they waste their time on such nonsense?
- Carrasco will never surrender.
- I read it.
Why did you lie?
Because I'm convinced that it isn't true.
I'm not sure if I should believe it or not.
I no longer know what he's capable of.
- What makes you think he didn't do it?
"- It's too terrible, too incomprehensible."
I don't believe that he is a man who would cause such a catastrophe by mistake.
- Are you implying that?
- Yes.
Silveira.
Not even a bastard like Silveira is capable of something like this.
Why would they make Carrasco a martyr by killing him?
"No, Mariá."
This is just what they needed.
A stab right into the people's heart.
Very good.
"In a few days, you won't feel any more pain."
It barely hurts now.
Thanks.
- A total triumph.
- You didn't manage to arrest him.
How can you call it a triumph?
It makes me sick to look at this burnt plane.
- It could have been me.
- So you know you've been lucky this time.
- One more impertinence...
- You've been lucky.
Who knows how many more times you will be?
!
Don't flatter yourself.
I couldn't care less about a spoiled kid like you.
You're simply a diversion to lure away the palace's eyes.
What?
!
Let me fill you in on a little secret.
We're going to kill the empress.
What did you say?
!
You're going to kill Her Majesty?
!
Do you seriously think you can do anything that absurd?
!
Is killing the empress really that absurd?
We're going to destroy those detestable Outer Terrans and become the rulers of this planet.
I won't let anyone stop us from attaining our rightful place.
"No, not even you, Ion!"
All eyes at the palace are on you at the moment.
"I thank you, tovaras."
Damn you...
Are you that concerned for Esther?
Looks like I guessed right.
"But are you sure it's wise, Ion?"
"She's not only a Terran, but a member of the Vatican."
So what if she is?
!
"My point is, do you really want to be betrayed yet again?"
How do you think I predict every single move you make?
Are you saying Esther is betraying me?
!
What rubbish!
- l don't want to hear of it!
And if a guest should leave me a tip for tidying up?
"No. I'll tell you something, you know what."
Yes.
You sometimes bring a tip from a wedding and you say:
"It was good, we got 150 crowns."
Don't pass judgment on me.
Don't compare yourself with me!
I'm just advising you.
But they may leave something there for me.
The main is for you to learn German.
"But if they leave money for me, what should I do?"
Don't complicate things again!
I'm afraid Mi?
ka might be naive.
She'll be easily taken in.
"I certainly don't want it to be like in that song, when he was tired of flying from one flower to another... I insist that when Mi?"
"ka one day falls in love, she should stay with him."
So she isn't a flighty little flower.
"Wait a minute, don't shut it!"
"Come on, quick!"
Our daughter's going to Austria and you shut the gates in front of us.
I keep saying they ought to make a footbridge here.
I know it's not your fault.
We're late because of you.
So many different hats and we miss the train.
But that's not our train!
"That's not our train, is it?"
"It's not, but we should already be there."
Come on!

You understand?
And and...

"You sold this car with lot of effect, and she was saying no."
"That's why Chandni made her unconscious, yeah Chandni?"

"Get some water madam is going unconscious, lets run with the car, this diamond is mine because this car is in my showroom."
Diamond is mine because the car is mine.
This diamond is four of us.
But what if Laxmi Narayan came to pick up the car then?
"Then we will sale him the car, what?"
But before that we will take out the diamond.
"You, never listen to me ever."
"Laxmi Narayan Jee i am Laila speaking, yeah?"

It's just like you said.
I'm your insurance policy.
What are you talking about?
"Well, as long as I'm your hostage, they can't get to you."
"You can demand a ransom from my father... we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico just like you said."
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst."
- What?
"- On second thought, maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea."
We'll have to wait in line at the border while they check the trunk for illegal fruit.
"- I mean, come on."
"- No, I'm completely serious."
They'll never be able to get us.
I'm your hostage.
There's no way they could possibly think we're in this together.
It's getting close.
It's getting real close.

"Given the situation, I see why you're T.O and all."
"But, what's done is done."
And my partner comes first.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- It means... that if you try to take her out or get into the middle of our job, you're in front world of hurt!"
"I know what you're capable of, but we're pros too."
We also know that you're comin' now.
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was your age?
I don't either.
I like you kid.
"You're in over your head and you're scared, yet you look death in the eye without blinking."
"It's admirable, but it won't save you."
It won't save your partner and it won't save your new pal.

You've got an hour.
Sorry about that stuff I said before.
What's them?
When I called you stupid and stuff.
That's okay.
Did you find anymore bullets all around?
Hey.
Wanna hear somethin'?
Your daughter doesn't hate you.
How do you know?
I know.
"Well, could you?"
You never even met her.
But every bit of you hammering away at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.
So I'm here to tell you thank you...
Because now I feel like I can finally move forward with my life.
"You're welcome, Louis."
And I think that this means that you're officially ready.
"- Uh, for what?"
- To take back the associates.
"Okay, Donna, no, I appreciate that."
But they're yours now.
"They were never mine, Louis."
I was always just taking care of them for you.

"Nope, there's just more to life than working here."
Am I being punked?
"No, not at all."
"It's just that you have a new supervisor starting tomorrow, and he would like you to get a good night's sleep."
And he told you to tell me that?
"Oh, Jesus, Brian, please, will you work with me?"
I'm the new supervisor.
"And listen, I am sorry for saying all those horrible things to you about undedicated."
I can't even imagine how you balance being a new dad with this workload.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

"Oh, hey."
How you doing today?
All right.
Just came to have a second look.
Yeah.
"Can I ask you something, Gerald?"
Yeah.
What's the problem exactly?
Sorry?
Why won't you let yourself have this car?
What do you mean?
What is it really?
Is it that you think if you buy this car you're gonna find another car you like better elsewhere immediately after buying it?
Or is it that you just think you don't deserve the car?
"Man, you don't know me."
"No, Gerald."
"Please, I'm not insulting you, so please don't take it like that, okay?"
I'm just trying to understand you.
"Because all these salespeople around here, take a look at them."

"She missed the tram, I caught up with her, officer, uniform.. she fell for it."
I greeted her and said:
I don't mind... wait... I said:
I don't mind escorting you even if it's several kilometres on foot.
Who wouldn't fall for that?
So I escorted her.
"Vinohrady, Streleck¨¢ 12... 23."
He's burbling on!
You missed the tram.
"I did, because it was... lt wasn't yet the Protectorate, but it was already looking gloomy."
I was impressed by the fact that she didn't want it:
Do you mind!
I have always been a protector of frail women.
"I was more frail than I am now, there's no arguing about that."
And she said to me:
"Slovaks have always impressed me, but not ones who go to pubs."
I said:
"D'you mind, I'm bored here."
"Where are those moments, the time I was young."

"In less than an hour, he'd dug up four articles on Caine, gassed the Ferrari and packed a lunch."
"After bridge tomorrow, Zeus and Apollo might be having me for lunch."
But until then--
Caine's life was a Horatio Alger story.
"Orphaned at birth, he ran away to sea at 1 4, sailed freighters until the war, then enlisted."
He fought in Europe and was decorated for bravery twice.
"After the war, law school on the G.I. Bill and a lucrative practice in New York and so on, until he was nominated for the Supreme Court."
[ Engine Revving ]
All the articles read the same:
Robert Caine was an amazing man.
"I wasn't sure a brief marriage to a prostitute who disappeared 40 years ago... was going to do him any real damage, even if it did leak."
Not with his record.
But I couldn't help feeling there was more to it than that.

So we know that the killer struck Petty Officer Adams hard and fast.
The wound is four inches in length and five inches in depth.

I know he's got a cousin in the department up there.
He hasn't called colleen.
She's out of her mind.
"You know something, if we keep covering for him like this, needles finds out, asshole mode he's in, trouble in river city."
"I hope he's not pulling this disappearing act because, you know, he knows I found out about what went on with him and colleen."
What?
I think so.
It's alright.
Shh!
"See, Fen?"
No harm done.
Huh?
I wasn't hurt.
"- Fen was helping, I know."
- Pa.
Pa.
"It's alright, girl."
It's alright now.
Fen stabbed Hugo de Jaager.
She was trying to protect Mr. Travis.
You caught your murderer.
"Makes you happy, does it?"
You're going to advocate for Fen to remain at the asylum.
Yes... though I can hardly argue that she wasn't in her right mind when she stabbed Mr. de Jaager.
"She was attacking a man she thought was harming her father, a perfectly rational action."
"But she didn't have men's rea, a guilty mind, so I have considerable leeway."
Can she be helped?
I don't know.
"But with further attention and care, she may be able to learn to control her wildness."
And become civilized.
(Julia sighs.)
"Given the behaviour of some of the so-called civilized people we encounter in our work, I wonder what we'd be teaching her."
"Well, she did show us that she's capable of empathy, Julia, by attempting to protect Mr. Travis the way she did."
It is the hallmark of humanity.
"No matter what we may think of him as a man, she saw him as her father."
"William, there's something I have to tell you."
(Julia sighs.)
"You have to look your best, little man."
You are not my mother.
And you are not my child.
"You know, since we're talking, with mouths -- not really an opportunity that comes along very often --"
"I just want to say, you know, you have never been very reliable."
And you have?
You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.
"No, but I always took you where you needed to go."
You did.
"Look at us, talking!"
"Wouldn't it be amazing, if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?"
You know I'm not constructed that way.
I exist across all space and time and you talk and run around and bring home strays.
I do really feel like they're soulmates.
"They're best friends, they're siblings, they're family."
They can't live without each other.
You can't have one without the other.
"In the top 3 saddest moments of ""Doctor Who"""
was when the TARDIS had to go back to being a TARDIS.
She just wanted to say
"""Hello."""
I'm alive.
"""Alive"" isn't sad."
It's sad when it's over.
"I'll always be here, but this is when we talked and, now, even that has come to an end."
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.
Goodbye.
No.
I just wanted to say hello.
"Hello, Doctor."
Doctor.
"It's so very, very nice to meet you."
And a bit risky.
"Well, the only way to get what you want is to risk what you have."
That's a belief you and I share.
And what is it that you want?
I'll find Audrey another date.
"You want Grace involved in this, fine."
But I can't have her working against us.
Why were you even there?
"I wanted to meet the person who was planning on screwing my husband, and I'm glad I did because that woman wanted to have your baby."
They're all looking for a connection.
That's why they're seeing an escort.
You of all people should know that.
Don't make this about me and Simon.
You know I have to have a date.
Then I want to be there.
"And I want a date, too."
I tell you what.
"If it'll make you more comfortable, you choose my date, and I'll choose someone for you."
This is insane.
Maybe.
Probably.
We don't have to do this.
"You just say the word, I'll call the whole thing off."
"No, I-I don't know where we're going, but..."
We can't go back to what we were.
So... tell me... what are you looking for in a escort?
- Thanks for coming.
- This better be important.
I've left you three messages over the last couple of days.
Your date for the party.
She's fun.
She's friendly.
Stand up.
It means yes.
- Go!
' Tangakl
Morning to dawn
Give it to Zahireh_
Go ahead.
Did Zaer Kheder allow you to play Kettledrum?
I don't understand.
How you don't understand?
Didn't you go to talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder'?
I said I don't get it.
I said I don't get it.
So don't talk about Tangak anymore.
If I'm going to go to Tangak there is nothing related to Zaer Kheder regarding my decision to go to Tangak_
So what?
My decision of going to Tangak is separate from bringing the cradle.
I have to go to Tangak_
Say it again please!
How there was no word of tangak before yesterday?
Now we are talking about it!
I've decided to go there and I will.
"Mr. Bashirou, did you think if you go to another city, you'll become a real man?"
We have been faced so many problems because of Tangak's people.
"They forced your father to move in to Bushehr, don't you remember?"
Why are you silent?
"It was because of you and Hanieh that my father had to move in to Bushehr and put Zaer Kheder in trouble, but now for you and Hanieh I have to go to Tangak_"
Tangak's people will put you in trouble my little son.
- You can't survive.
- How can they put me in trouble?
They are unable to confront me.
I am so tough-skinned_
"My dear citizens, we are living in difficult times."
"Once again, our people's enemies have shown their true, cruel, bloody colours."
Their cowardly terrorist attacks only hit those they claim to be fighting for.
If their true aim was political change in this country...
- Pass the ball to me.
"- Come on, children, we must go."
Hurry up.
Come on.
"Run, run, run."
Get into the car.
"Come on, hurry up."
"Doctor, are you really going to leave us?"
The guerrilleros will be here soon.
They're killers.
Haven't you heard the news?
- I don't want to be here when they come.
- They don't fight doctors and priests.
These people don't know what a conscience or a God is.
All they know is violence.
"If they come, they'll destroy this town."
The militia would be just as bad.
- I don't feel like dying.
- You can't shirk your responsibilities.
- You can't let the hospital down.
"- Padre, listen to me."
"I get paid for my medical services, not for heroism."
Why should I stay?
Just to cure a few sick people?
You stay.
Perhaps you'll be canonised one day.
But I...
"I need my hat, not a halo."
So what are you after?
Reaching for the moon?
Nope.
Just one little star.
On a dressing room door.
"Want to be a playactress, huh?"
"Oh, i am one."
I barnstormed through the midwest for two seasons.
This is the only job i could get in new york.
But i don't care - at least i'm in a theater.
"Before i get through, i'm going to be a great actress."
That's the way to say it.
"Think big, talk big, and you'll be big."
"Say, you're a good looker."
Got the spirit of a thoroughbred.
All you need is a little sprucing up.
"Here, get into this."
You and me are going to paint the town.
"I've got some acting for you to do, and you'll put that fleurique in the shade."
But these are her clothes.
That's stealing.
Only little people steal.
Big people call it borrowing.
But-but what will mademoiselle say?
I can't wear her clothes.
You certainly can't wear that hired gal's rig where we're going.
Where are we going?
To the astor house.
You've got a sight of gall.
And i'm daring you to show some.
"She threw things at you, didn't she?"
"Listen, when you're scratching for corn and another chicken comes along and shoves you out of the way, get right back into that circle and make the feathers fly."
"Oh, sorry."
"I shoot straight, and hope that it'll be tempered by my teddy-bear cuteness."
Uh-huh.
Bullet hole through the window.
Clear.
Clear.
"Well, that's Ridgeway."
Looks like he's been dead a few days.
"What else do you see, Mr. Observant?"
This guy's not gonna be painting anytime soon.
"He's not gonna be answering any questions, either."
"Dr. Ryan, from the moment Jethro first mentioned your name and told me of your passion for the inner workings of the human mind,"
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
Kindred spirit.
That's exactly what I was gonna to say.
"Plenty of time for spirits later, Duck?"
Ah.
"Thank you, Jethro."
Ever diligent in the war on small talk.
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
"The bullet pierced the sternum, headed straight through the dorsal side, and lodged itself in an adjacent wall."
"Happily, it is now in the capable hands of Miss Sciuto."
GIBBS:
That it?
"Well, based on the rate of decomposition, he expired approximately 72 hours prior to discovery."
GIBBS:
Before we started playing Wickes.
"Oh, please."
Mr. Ridgeway.
Do you mind if I call you Larry?
(whispers):
"Ooh, I like this woman."
Stop it!
hey!
Get off her!
Get off her!
get up.
"How'd this guy die,doctor?"
"As I told you,when I know,you'll know."
Know faster.
Shaving off your moustache has brought back your usual impatience.
Good.
Means I'm doing my job.
I do have a potential cause of death.
But it's by no means airtight.
See this fracture?
"Well,yeah,you're inting right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidurm hematoma, verified by this cat scan."
Though it's far from massive.
"Statistically, it's only fatal in about 17% of cases."
- Blunt-force trauma?
- Most likely.
"We're looking at a baseball bat or a golf club, perhaps wielded by a disgruntled fianc?"
.
You ll me how;
I'll figure out who.
Intelligence has placed la grenouille in nairobi.
That might mean a shipment to somalia.
We'll continue to monitor these activities.
Just do ur best.
Ssion trouble?
It's need-to-kn.
Initiate the video conference special agent gibbs requested.
Have you figured out why somebody would unbury a body?
What does she think of herself?
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!
What the fuck do you think you are doing!
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!
I don't know what kind of tuitions you have been giving.
But learn this from me.
Take out your sim card!
Stay away from them they are rich and connected!
They will get you busted so bad you won't know what hit you!
Give me the sim card I will throw it away.
If you throw my sim card then how will my sisters call me?
Give them my number!
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?
Use my card and give them this number.
I am not going to let her get away with this!
I will cut her to pieces!
Don't talk shit.
We are out of booze as well!
Come...
Come on...
This godforsaken town is a real shit hole!
You place your trust in people thinking they are your friends.
But the moment you turn around they ram it right up your ass.
I'll go give this number to my sisters.
"Ok, but now don't go stressing them out as well."
"Hello, Sonu!"
Are you alright?
Who's number is this?
"It's a friend's number, save it on your phone."
You're gonna be vice president.
- You'll talk about legitimate issues of concern.
- Right.
Where is the senator's monitor?
There is no monitor for her.
She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.
That is a piece of shit.
"We talked about this, Ray."
"If Peter's gonna be able to see her, she has to be able to see him."
- He's got a sensory advantage over her.
- You wanna pull her?
I'm not talking about pulling her.
I'm just saying it's bullshit.
She was just great in the hearings today.
Cool and collected.
- Steve Poullet.
- Hi.
Should I hear anything?
"Oh, I got it."
"Okay, great."
"Oh, it's that one."
"Yeah, I know."
Can't hear...
"Yeah, right, got it."
"Okay, I've got the intro now."
"Thank you for having me, Peter."
"Sure, that'd be fine."
"Well, it has been a taxing experience... but if we're forced to take the voters out of the equation..."
I think that the vetting system by simple necessity must be arduous.
Mmm.
"I have to plead motherhood on that one, Pete... but I not only served on the Foreign Relations Committee..."
"I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill which readjusted the War Powers Act... to allow the executive to respond to state-sponsored terrorism... like that of Iraq, Libya, North Korea, for instance."
"Actually, I wasn't alone."
Sergeant Hutchinson here served as my foil.
"- Well, thank you, Doc."
- Don't mention it.
"One day, you'll be proud to announce that you had the honor... of observing the great Dr. Winchester."
Anything I should know from here on out?
- Ask the expert.
- Just keep a close watch.
"If there's infection, the tantalum acts as a foreign body... and you have to remove it."
"If you'll excuse me, I have to sweep out the lab."
It just doesn't seem fair.
He's as good a nurse as any of us here.
## [Harbor Lights]
- ## [Stops]
- That's enough from the hurt parade.
"As long as the ""Harbor Lights"" are on, you're never gonna see things clearly."
"Oh, I see things very clearly."
That's why I'm writing Gus.
"""Dear Scum."""
I figured I'd start slow and then really let him have it.
Gus knew I still loved Laverne.
I told him that when I wrote him.
I don't understand something.
If all this happened because you wrote Gus in the first place... how were you gonna make things better by writing Gus in the second place?
What do you want from me?
I can't just sit and wallow in self-pity.
"Oh, Laverne!"
Laverne!
"Klinger, listen to me."
"You're yelling at him, but you're crying for her."
"If you wanna communicate with Laverne, why don't you write Laverne?"
- Hey.
I haven't been saying anything!
You don't think I have enough problems without people thinking
I'm going around stomping other people's teeth out?
Do I need that?
!
Then who's been saying it then?
"There's ""Got your back"" guys and ""I'll be back"" guys."
Greg!
"Greg was a ""I'm running like a bitch"" guy."
"You two, in my office now."
Dr. Raymond hated his job because he didn't get paid enough.
"* Relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it... *"
So he blew off steam by dancing the nights away with a few close friends.
"* Relax, don't do it, when you want to step to it *"
"* Relax, don't do it... *"
You think I like calling you into my office?
Uh... or it could be a rupture of the blood vessels in the... subcutaneous tissue.
A hickey.
"15 years of marriage, and it's like no time's passed at all."
He's still playing around.
Poor thing.
"Officers, if you need any help, please don't hesitate."
Krystal Sneed.
I organized the event.
I know everybody here.
Any idea who might've given Patrick the love bite ?
Um... just between us ?
Patrick used to always make time with the undesirables.
He cheated on Jennie three times senior year.
Any of those ladies here today ?
Michelle Day.
Wouldn't exactly call her a lady.
"He'd found out about Johnny's letter, so he'd silenced Louis too."
And Louis' body was to block me out of the play with a murder rap.
"I had to get rid of Louis before the cops followed up Martinelli's next play, an anonymous tip to pay me a call."
Should I kick it in?
It may have been a phoney tip.
I don't know where it came f rom.
"- lt's you, the smart guy f rom Frisco."
- You're better than I thought.
- How'd you locate me?
- Mind if we take a look around?
Mind?
Why should I mind?
What's a little sleep?
You mind telling me what you're looking f or?
"Maybe that guy you was looking f or, Charlie Wilson."
- What do you know about that corpse?
"- Same as you, nothing."
You heard the report about that car smash.
That's why the rental job with a police call-band.
You knew that guy had been taken f or a ride.
You guys murder me.
- That's the only radio the shop had.
- l bet.
"If you'd stop playing smart, I might help."
"Where'd you get the head, the Sanctuary Club?"
You're a day early f or Easter bunnies.
You had a row with Louis Ord. What'd you threaten him about?
- Why don't you ask him?
- Don't think I won't.
"You don't object to my going back to bed, do you?"
"I got a habit of sleeping late, often right up to 6."
How long you known Coral Chandler?
An automatic machine for amusement.
Pop music.
Guided missiles.
Stress.
"-Tranquillizers, stimulants."
"-Myocardial infarction, reduction diet."
Jogging.
The escalator.
And public transport.
"Together all these things are called ""technical civilization""."
Technical civilization serves people so that they are happy and satisfied.
Technical civilization functions by using buttons.
Connection started.
Pop into the supermarket at least for mineral water.
"Hey gentlemen, a trolley!"
Act inconspicuously.
Observe.
Watch how people are doing it.
"-Push, push!"
-Don't act crazy.
-The bigger is carrying the smaller.
"-I told you, inconspicuously!"
-What a lot of things.
-All of these can produce people.
It's fantastic.
We must take samples.
We should have started here and not with the inquiry.
"""They spare your time""."
Do you know what fascinates me the most about people?
How they live.
Packaged time.
Magnificence.
"Be damned to you and your rag, sir."
My Rifles march at dawn.
"South, sir."
"Good night, Miss."
Lieutenant Sharpe!
Surprised to see me Richard?
Oh you've done a grand job a grand job
"But now, at dawn tomorrow, with the help of my agent,"
Comandante Teresa whom believe you've already met
I want you to seize the chapel of Torrecastro and hold it against all-comers until Major Vivar has raised the gonfalon of Sant'lago over the chapel roof.
Seize Torrecastro?
With six men and a straggle of Spaniards?
It can't be done.
"May I remind you of our main mission, sir?"
- To find a missing gentleman
"- Not now, Richard."
Our mission is Torrecastro.
Spain is a sleeping tiger.
"If the people of Torrecastro rise up, even for an hour, the shock will shake the whole of Spain."
"- Carry on, sir."
- Rise p?
"Do you really believe men will fight and die for a rag on a pole, sir?"
"You do, Richard."
You do.
Richard!
I knew you would not march to Torrecastro for a superstition.
I'm like you.
"I don't believe in virgins or holy candles, but I believe in Spain."
I had to choose between Spain and Richard Sharpe.
- I had no choice!
- You did your duty.
Now I must do mine.
"All we have to do is to get you a real show tonight, then Eddie can crawl around surreptitiously, change the audience's watches back to the time you blagged the store."
"Yes, yes, I know just the venue."
'Très chic.
Très bona.
"'Yeah, only the nicest young ladies need apply. '"
"A peepshow, Filthy?"
What if Tarby finds out?
I'll be thrown out of the Royal Order of the Charitable Self-Publicising Showbiz Bog Otters.
Don't worry about the Bog Otters.
They were in here themselves half an hour ago.
They had to leave cos they run out of 50p's.
How's my boy Richie doing?
"That audience are getting a bit restive at the moment, trying to see if bouncers really do bounce."
Don't mither the act.
"He's got enough to concern him, what with being crap."
You were supposed to be changing the audience's watches while they ogled the girlies.
I was trying to but the hands are moving too quickly.
Get on with it.
"Right, that's it."
"Richie, you're on."
"God, I'm not ready."
"How do I look, darling?"
"Not good, daughter."
"Très, très bollocks."
- He's absolutely bloody right.
- Philistines.
I'd better do my superstitions.
What are you doing?
"Titch ""Oo-er, madam, don't start me off"" Juicy always did this before a show."
- But he was notoriously awful.
"- God, you're right."
"Boys and girls, lads and lasses, please welcome to the stage a very funny man indeed, the world famous Mr, er..."
Just try and understand.
Excuse me!
I'll just come.
I can't kill her.
And when she return Bhai's diamond then why?
"I think electricity has gone, Papa."
Shits!
"It's will be back tomorrow, Papa."
Don't you have Inverter?
What?
Don't you have Inverter?
"Papa, he's challenging you, I'll turn on the inverter."
"Papa, forget about electricity and kill him with bomb."
"I am not that Laxminarayan, It must some another Laxmi."
Have you gone mad?
That Laxminarayan lives in my hotel.
"I saw him, you leave me Sir."
It's about my job.
No.
Not at all.
"There's another Laxminarayan, May be he lives in Room No. 504"
"I am not that Laxminarayan, He must be that under garments dealer."
If you lied to me then...
You're saying like I'll say something and you will follow me.
"Sir, do what you want,"
"Marveles Idea,"
"Come, show me, where is that another Laxminarayan?"
"Papa, You take the tie, who will take the tie man?"
"Don't worry,"
"If you want stuff then you have to show your stuff, and business happens like this, I think you don't know about business."
"I am in business from 40 years,"
"I will stop if you show me the stuff, Yes or No."
Those are exactly the same pictures.
Come to think of it... you sure do look like Suzukichi.
You are like two peas in a pod.
That's really something!
- Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
- Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes glares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, let's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'll devote himself to flirting with Clark's daughter.
Will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
Emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
When he thought there was a shirt under it.
I totally remember that.
"Rafi thought there was a shirt under my shirt when we were rehearsing and lifted up my hoody, and there wasn't a shirt under my shirt."
"I have to say, though, they don't..."
"Should I have to say, in a scene, that you should not pull up a girl's shirt?"
Don't pull up Kat's shirt in this one.
"I mean, am I supposed to say that in every scene?"
"I made it seem like it was Pete's fault, but it wasn't."
At least I was wearing a brassiere.
- Rafi was hoping to catch a glimpse.
"- No, I don't think he was."
- Rafi blamed it on his character.
"- Can I, like, reveal a secret?"
He was in character.
"This is embarrassing, but I wanna say it because you guys are here."
"After that happened, I re-created my crouch in my trailer pulled up my shirt to see what I look like."
Re-created your what?
"I was, like, ""I need do some crunches."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- You are so much.
"- Oh, no."
- That's what you do in your trailer?
That's what I...
"I know, it was really insecure of me."
"I like this part, Ari."
"We should talk about this stunt, Ari."
"- Oh, God, is this the...?"
- I didn't not...
"- Well, I accidentally hit it once."
- You hit your head once.
- But there was padding on the door.
- Should we talk about where this is?
"You have to be careful what you say around a coma patient, Mrs. Farrell."
A lot of times they can still hear what's going on around them.
"Listen, kid, if he knew he was dying and we weren't taking action, he'd be pissed."
"Besides, I bought him a few squares in case he comes out 'cause he gave me my Johnny."
And nothing else.
"Your dad's hospital room is really nice, Johnny."
"Yeah, they're taking really good care of him."
How much does a room like that cost?
"I don't know, he's got good insurance through the fire department, so it's pretty much covered."
"Good, good."
"Ball park, what do you think it normally costs?"
"Like, a night?"
"Six, seven?"
600 or 700?
Wow.
"6,000 or 7,000, Brian."
Shut up.
Shut up!
That room was so tiny.
Whoever set those prices is a criminal and deserves to spend the rest of their life in that miserable little room.
"I mean, did you see the view?"
Of course you didn't.
Because there wasn't one.
"Chicago North, ambulance needed, Lincoln Park carousel."
Reported leg injury.
Ambulance 14 responding.
And did you taste the jell-o?
'Cause I did.
I was not impressed.
You took my dad's jell-o?
"Well, it looks like you got a broken fibula, but we won't know until we get some x-rays."
"Wow, that music just goes on and on, huh?"
You don`t know acting

Is that my lady wisdom's view?

My constant care... has been to have my only child worthily matched.
"And here I find an educated man of equal birth with honorable parts, with fine estates and handsome to behold, and what is my reward?"
"A puking fool, who answers, ""I'll not wed."
I cannot love.
I am too young.
"I pray you pardon me."""
Now think on this.
Thursday is near.
"If you will play the bride, then are you my daughter and all is forgot."
"If you will not, then you are mine no more."
Graze where you will.
You shall not house with me.
"Beg, starve or hang,"
"I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor pass to you the slightest thing that's mine."
"I swear to this, my word, so help me God!"
How can Father speak so to a child who loves him better than she loves herself?
"Oh, oh, God."
Where are you going?
- Carlos:
Out.
- But--
"Carlos, wait!"
What's up with you?
"I'll catch you tomorrow, all right?"
If you told me a month ago
"I'd be running my pop's bodega, I'd say you were smoking crack."
If you had told me when we were in high school that I'd be the super of our building...
I'd told you that you were having some kind of psychotic episode.
"That shit is not even funny, man."
And you know what the thing of it is?
- What?
- I'm a pretty good super.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but it ain't that hard, man."
"It can be hard, you dumb fuck!"
"You've got to have all sorts of different management skills, you've got to know how to deal with all sorts of different people, you got to know your accounting, and I recycle."
Don't forget:
"""Always recycle."""
"""Blue goes with cans."
"Green goes with paper."""
Don't mix it with the fucking plastic.
Don't forget.
"- Oh, shit!"
- My ball!
- Carlos:
Come here.
"- Oh, thank you."
Carlos:
"Oh, you stupid fucker!"
"On weekends, me and Daisy got this thing, where she calls me-- to fix stuff in her apartment, and I go up, and we have sex."
"- How do you do, more like."
"- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!"
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.
- Would you...?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.
I felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.
"Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby."
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?
Mine is 116.
"""Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments."""

- How does it continue?
"- ""No."
"It is an ever fixed mark..."""
"- ""That looks on tempests..."""
"- Is it ""tempests""?"
It's strange you are reading these.
I don't like to make things about me.
"You know, people think of me as a giving person."
"Oh, I can't take it."
I'm blowing the lid off this web of lies.
"I'm gonna ""Brady Bunch"" her."
You know I wasn't allowed to watch television as a child.
"Well, this man blamed Carol for injuring his neck in a car accident, and then Mike and the kids went to court, and then Mike dropped a briefcase, which caused the man with the fake neck brace"
"to whip his head around, proving that his neck wasn't hurt at all."
The whole family went to court for a traffic accident?
"The doctor was supposed to be examining my neck,"
- but his eyes were journeying.
- It's quite a journey.
"Mama, I can't find my ball."
Try to find anything else to squeeze.
"You know, I had him on a flight once to JFK."
No!
He kept on pressing the help button.
It was supposedly because he didn't know how to work the...
Damn it!
"I thought you said the ""Brady Bunch"" man dropped his briefcase, not his husband's spaghetti plate!"
Mom!
You okay?
"Oh, she's fine."

Isn't it about time that somebody put this kid on medication?
"Well, don't use our own troops."
We've got some adapted Helots under training.
"Yes, I've seen them."
- What do you think of them?
- They seem like all Helots after adaptation.
"Suggestible, obedient and glad to follow orders."
They should make excellent troops.
I don't know.
"Something missing, I think."
"- Fire in the belly, Quute."
You can't fight without it.
"- No, of course not, sir."
- I'm meeting the President-elect later on.
"- Yes, I'd heard he'd arrived."
"- He's a Helot, they say."
- Practor?
"Oh, yes, born and bred."
It's a good idea getting one of their own to run the place.
"- Is he adapted, sir?"
"- It's not necessary,"
Practor's been on the Federation civil list for years.
He knows all the ropes.
So it shouldn't take too long to hand over.
Then we can get on to Wanta.
- Wanta?
- That's our next assignment.
"- Something to look forward to, eh?"
"- Yes, sir, I'm looking forward to that no end."
"Where exactly is Wanta, sir?"
- How long till we make planetfall?
- Just over two hours.
You'd better check out which gun kits you want.
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Sally, then we'll get back to your tests."
"Well, excuse me, Doctor,"
Sally have you ever seen those two clowns before?
"So help me, Judy, you've seen the last banana in your life, you two-timing little rat!"
"When we get you back to Wameru, you'll get solitary confinement in a cage."
The second I get my hands free
I'm gonna wallop the daylights outta you.
(SCREECHING)
Sally!
"Captain, Sergeant, quick, before she gets lost."
"Hey, Captain, get these ropes off us."
We'll help you find her.
After what you threatened?
You'd probably kill her.
"Hey, there she is."
Judy.
Come here.
(CHATTERING)
- Come on.
"- Come on, Judy."
That's a good girl.
Now come on.
Untie these ropes.
"Come on, Judy, get these ropes off."
"No, Judy, you're not the world-famous astro-chimp."
"You're just plain, old-fashioned, smart-aleck Judy from Wameru."
"For Pete's sake, Judy, you're not Sally."
"Sally is obviously an intelligent, superior, well-behaved animal, and you're just a spoiled little brat."
"Jack, do you suppose something has happened to Judy and she really believes she's Sally?"
She could be suffering from some kind of nervous disorder.
The only thing she's suffering from is a sense of misplaced grandeur.
How can I help you?
Okay.
Meet me at the station.
Desmond Bennett wants to make a statement.
Probably wants to make a deal.
Can't wait to wipe that smug British grin off his face.
Cool.
I'll wait for forensics.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, and then I'll go arrest our girl."
All right.
My patients...
"Morgan Lewis, Ethan Grant, Troy Dixon."
What's this?
That's a video statement.
Each patient has one.
Is physical evidence really a good idea?
We decided we needed an insurance policy.
"In case we ever got caught, we have a legal contract and statement that proves the patient gave consent."
You think this is gonna hold up in court?
I hope I never have to find out.
How do we find our patients?
They come to us.
"Well, we're gonna have to do something about that, maybe hire some death dealers."
I'm not soliciting death.
You should be.
What else?
Now we practice injections.
Hold your arm out.
You're a funny girl.
"Relax, it's saline."
"I think you misunderstand the nature of our relationship here, Mary."
Can brother come along too?
Everyone has a free will.
They can come if they want or not come... if they don't want to.
It doesn't make a difference to me.
How much is this for?
You dare attack from behind?
Come on put it in neutral.
Who is it?
Jabbar sir it wasn't us.
Here.
Get your self treated.
Here.
Goodbye.
That's Jabbar the beggar...
What happened?
Did the tank explode?
No you've been exposed.
Take look.
Look.
Last night was the most embarrassing night... in the History of politics.
The entire country was shocked to see this.
25 MLA s of minister Vishwas Pradhan... were caught along with prostitutes late in the night... and in front of the entire media.
The unknown person that informed the media... calls himself a social-worker.
This is a conspiracy of the opposition.
The parliament speaker... has decided to suspend all the MLA s.
And the ruling have given a statement that... they are ready for a hung assembly...
But they will never take the support of these MLA s.
I am ruined.
My power's gone.
And wife too.
Rascal swine pervert.
Yes!
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?
You see the basketball court?
"Mr. President, can I ask you a question for my YouTube channel?"
- That'd be all right.
What's your name?
- Emily Cale.
"Emily Cale, go ahead."
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?
I wasn't ready for a press conference.
How do you expect 22 Arab nations with different regional and religious interests to agree on a single treaty especially given the newly erupting conflicts between the Shiites and the Sunnis in southern Pakistan?
Tough question.
"To be honest with you, I don't know."
"Whether they'll agree or not I'm not sure, but I gotta try."
The day we stop believing different people can come together is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.
What I am ready to do is give a little girl a shout-out on her YouTube blog.
"Hi, folks, my name is James W. Sawyer and I'm here with Emily Cale and her video blog."
Check it out.
- You have a good one.
- Wait.
"Mr. President, this is my dad John."
He's gonna be on your Secret Service detail.
Secret Service detail.
Is that right?
"You know, I take my protection detail very seriously."
"- Yes, sir."
- Stop lying to children.
"- Nice to meet you, Emily."
"- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President."
You guys have a good one.
It looks like an intramuscular injection.
Absolutely alone.
I repeat my question:
Were you really alone last night?
Are you sure?
You had invited anyone?
Mathilde!
Mathilde.
"For whatever reason, you could have poisoned your patron."
And then deceived us by injecting it into yourself.
A soporific.
All this is not clear and I am obliged to place you under arrest.
Until you decide to tell us the truth.
But I am innocent.
I said all I knew.
You may enjoy explaining it to the Judge.
"""La Capitale"", latest edition!"
Latest edition!
Come in.
The pictures you requested.
"Put them over there, thank you."
"Hello, Fandor!"
"Interesting, that paper of yours on the Norvins St. case."
You have surprised everyone once more.
And say so ...
Couldn't you push a little further?
"They have no adventures, these people?"
Adventures?
"Yes, you could write a scandalous article about the Baroness de Vibray and Dollon."
"After all, this is the only crime for 48 hours."
We must fill up the column.
And maybe you could drag some Fantomas in all this.
"Whatever, dude."
Nice.
"So, I went to the big meeting."
In two months the town will vote whether or not to close us down.
"Now, that will give people time to think."
"- What if they vote, ""Yes?"""
- I don't know.
"Look, what's with you guys?"
Don't you remember who we are?
Sonny Newman founded this home before there ever was a Charlestown.
His dog Dexter saved the entire city from the great flood of 1938 with one proud woof.
"The amazing Hanson brothers, whose ferocious might and legendary skill won the Federal Cup for this town in 1977."
They lived in this very house when they were boys just like us.
"Gentlemen, we are the Hanson brothers."
We are the children of the great Sonny Newman.
"We are the princes of Charlestown, and we will never be forgotten!"
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Double dessert for everybody!
- Yes!
Except for you!
"Time was, we never had a free skate on a Saturday."
Everybody'd be playing hockey.
I'm talking from toddlers to old guys like me.
"Good or bad, it didn't matter."
People loved it.
When the Chiefs won the title in '77...
I won a couple of banners myself playing junior in the '80s.
- You know what they used to call me?
- What's that?
- Fireball Rick.
- Are you serious?
Maybe the phone call hadn't worked.
But it had.
All I had to do was wait.
He was right on schedule.
"I was thinking, ""Go ahead."
"Beat it to your big beach home. """
This is the same gag you pulled on me.
It's even the same corpse.
Only thing missing is a sledgehammer highball and a pair of snake-eyes dice.
There was one joker.
What if he'd left a goon to watch his office?
"Here I was again, back to the scene of the TNT highball with the pretty girl camouflaging the safe."
Martinelli left in a hurry.
He hadn't turned the radio off.
"Not that I don't like music, but I work better in silence."
"I'm crazy about you, sweetheart, but move over."
"She moved over, Father."
The safe was wide open.
Martinelli really had hauled freight in a hurry.
"After my trouble to get Martinelli out, this would be dandy."
"I kept thinking, ""lt had to be here somewhere. """
"Up to now, everything had gone like grief."
He had the letter.
He'd been working on it.
But he hadn't gotten very far with his homework.
He was doing research on that letter but good.
The Leising Book of Codes.
Here was the real merchandise.
I recognized Johnny's writing.
Martinelli!
Martinelli!
"Then, suddenly, I got a whiff of jasmine."
And then I superimposed it...
With a page I photographed in a diary.
Of your diary?
But why did you...
Photograph the picture and didn't take the film negative?
In order to have a photograph...
That's even more photographic than the photograph itself.
"Further away from reality, than it already is."
To really show it's a photograph.
"And not reality, and even less than reality..."
And a lot further than reality.
"You don't like that one, do you?"
I find it strange.
Paris?
This is Paris.
In the 17th district.
And...
Is there a trick?
"There's no trick, it's only sort of faded."
"It's colored, it's colored..."
That's not part of the picture.
It's colored with yellow here.
"Yes, it's my watch."
The one I have around my neck right now.
But why taking a picture like this?
It's a still life.
Still life pictures are vanities.
Vanities in the baroque sense...
"Things that are futile, empty, abandoned..."
Perishable.
That will disappear.
And this one?
You hungry?
Want to go out?
Tired.
"Yeah, all right."
I need to tell you what I found out about Ronan Murphy.
"What, you looked into it?"
Murphy was a person of interest in the inquiry into the murder of Tommy Hunter.
In what way?
Ronan Murphy was one of Hunter's closest associates.
We never interviewed him.
Major Violent Crime did.
Ronan Murphy was interviewed about the conspiracy Lindsay Denton was convicted of?
Looks like it.
None of this was in the file.
It must been doctored.
You didn't get any of this from me.
"Well, well..."
Who'd have thought?
What are you after?
You ever heard the name Ronan Murphy?
Why d'you ask?
Just thought you might have heard the name.
Are you reopening my case?
"Forget it, all right?"
That's not why I'm asking.
"Look, I don't expect you to care, Steve, but I'm never, ever going to get back to being that person that I was before all this happened."
"You know, the only thing that kept me sane, the thing that got me up in the morning, was being a police officer."
"I want to find the people that framed me, Steve, and I believe..."
"Well, I HOPE that you do, too."
The audio file on this phone is as embarrassing to you as it is to me.
"Believe you me, I've got it backed up."
I don't enjoy threatening people.
Is the plane ready?
"Yes, Miss Bristol."
Let's go.
Where will the conference take place?
At the Quito Hotel.
Is that so?
"Yes, all has been arranged, as instructed."
Have the models reported in?
"Yes, they are traveling by commercial flight, accompanied by Maddame Rapiee"
"All is well, Lucrecia?"
The operation will take place in Quito.
Will our other agents have any problems?
"No, all has been arranged, the only one that cannot pass trough customs is you, you are too well known by the intelligence agency."
"Very well, Lucrecia, I am now in your hands."
We wil go to Quito in one of the emergency planes.
And where shall we find it?
the secret landing strip is not far away.
What would you like?
Do you have loose American cigarretes?
Lights?
Twentieth century brand?
only Fiteenth century.
"Here, this is for you."
"""In case of extreme circumstances, look for contact in Quito, code 00100"""
When will we go into action?
"It will be soon, the members will arrive today."
"Agent one, S.O.S."
Got a light?
My matches are wet.
I do.
"I am Charlie, he is Sibor."
"I know, I was expecting you."
You're not on the run.
Licence is in order.
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't wanna live here.
Too many ghosts.
Door.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCO detective also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago... while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
"Yeah, the kids found the bodies."
I saw something about that on the news.
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of her bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
After that he wrapped this tape around her face.
Suffocated her.
Must have taken a while.
The man who organised it is called Jacob Gould.
A real high flyer.
But I think he had help from the inside.
From who?
Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
"So you're part of this Operation Merlin thing as well, are you?"
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"Who do you work for, then?"
"Oh, now, there's a question."
"Lex, if you open that box, if you get hold of that secret, there will be no redemption for you."
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.

I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of kara and brainiac.
I can't let lana sit in that asylum in pain.
The only way to help her is to find brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
"I mean, there's no bogey or blip unaccounted for."
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was lionel luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, Mr. Luthor, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Yeah.
I knew I'm an absolute phoney here.
And that is the closest I ever got to...
You went to school with the lead singer.
"And yeah, probably once took a punch for him or something."
But that's the closest my pro golf career ever got.
"That's what Take That's like now, though, isn't it?"
There's only three of them left now.
"Yeah, but it's the worst ones, isn't it?"
The worst ones are left.
I've a lot of respect for people who just leave at the...
"Like John Deacon was the bass player in Queen and I think after Freddie died, he went, ""Right, I'm out."
"""I'm done."
"We had a great band."""
"And that's it, whereas the others keep appearing at the top of Buckingham Palace."
"I love him, though."
Brian.
Do you love Brian?
I love him because...
I just love him.
I love how passionate he is about badgers.
"He's really good at the guitar, isn't he?"
"No, I don't care about that."
It's the badgers and the foxes and stuff.
I'm a big animal lover.
Is he into badgers?
Do you have badgers in America?
I'm sure we do.
We're killing the badgers over here.
We're killing them off because they're - what is it?
"Apparently, they've got TB."
"They've got TB and they're passing it on, so we're culling them."
People are against it.
- As for you...
Rebecca.
Her name was Rebecca.
- Is that all you know about her?
"- Well, not too much more, I guess."
- Does that make you feel good?
"- No, it doesn't."
"Eric, every once in a while, let your brain in on what the rest of you is doing."
Are you two both clear on this?
"But if I can't use Eric's method, then how do I get a girl to say hi?"
- Cory...
- Yeah?
What did you know about girls before your brother's excellent advice?
- I didn't know anything.
- Why don't you just go with that?
"Um, ready to go?"
"Look, are you feeling a little funny about this?"
"You mean, about going out on a date?"
"Yeah, because we don't even know each other."
A little funny.
"So do you wanna, like, not go out on a date?"
"- Yeah, it doesn't feel right."
- I understand.
But we should still get to know each other.
"Oh, that would be nice."
"Yeah, because then, in case we ever did want to go out, well, we'd know each other."
"So, um, how do you want to get to know each other?"
"Well, we could go somewhere and talk..."
if you don't have something else to do.
"Well, I did, but, um..."
now I'm suddenly free.
Great.

This is my house.
"It is located in Trnje, in 87 Paromlinska street."
"It was built by my granddad who was a railwayman, back in 1909."
"It was where my father was born, and so was I."
But we haven't been living here permanently.
My father was a teacher.
"I've spent most of my childhood in Dalmatia, and when I got back to my old house at the age of 17, boys from the hood kept calling me ""Dalmo"" for a while."
I'm a loner.
I teach history and geography at elementary school nearby.
"Circumstancially, I never got married, and I wouldn't find easy to move away from here since the house, like the rest of this street, is to be demolished soon."
I haven't been disturbed when I heard about this.
"For quite some time, I wasn't even paying attention to it."
"What do I need, anyway?"
"I begun serious thinking about the house, my departing and the whole neighborhood only when Fabian shown up."
"One day, he just rang my doorbell."
Good day.
- Good day!
I was looking for you already.
You may heard of it.
Neighbors just told me!
-Yeah?
-Progress report.
Excuse me?
Progress report?
"No, ""Hello, how are you?"""
"Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming me up."
What?
"I love capitalism as much as the next guy, but this is off the charts."
"Your commerce is so far up my ass, I can't sit up."
"Listen, the Age of Aquarius never happened, okay?"
-Get real.
This is commerce.
-I want to tell you something for your soul.
Pushing for Christmas and radio play will only amount to shit and wrapping paper.
"I don't know what happened, Jane."
We really used to be on the same page.
"I don't know what happened either, Claudia."
I guess you started exercising.
Gotta go.
Bitch.
Cunt.
Can we just say how lovely Jane looks today?
Can we just have a moment of appreciation for our sweet lovely Jane?
Jane rocks.
Get the fuck out of my chair.
I had a math teacher in high school who was sort of my mentor.
"You know, I was one of those science geeks and my mother wasn't really around."
"So he took me under his wing, and he convinced me that I should be a doctor."
Which seemed like the right idea at the time.
"You know, I guess I needed to prove myself."
To who?
Who were you trying to prove yourself to?
He was crying.
"Very, very upset."
He wanted to go home.
To his mommy.
And I wanted to send him home.
But I knew I couldn't.
Then I told him I would take him.
"I put him in my car, started driving."
He kind of cheered up.
But of course I wasn't taking him home.
I was taking him... somewhere else.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
"Who else is lying about that day, Mark?"
Are you?
Are your friends?
Jesse was crying when I found him.
"Who made him cry, huh?"
The DNA tie-in with the missing kid is potentially huge.
For now this cannot get out.
We dig away until we know exactly what we are dealing with.
Don't want journalists banging on my door.
Danny.
The murder victim is yet to be ID-ed.
But we are tracing her mobile as it's possible the killer might have taken it with him.
Next.
"Now given the reputation of the murder location and the manner of her dress, we're working on the possibility that she was accepting payment for sex."
"So it could be a disgruntled client, partner of someone."
Or drug-related.
Every hooker I've encountered has been an addict.
We all know how many hookers Mickey's encountered.
"Yeah, it's very funny."
Of all the fucking people.
She gave up everybody.
"Jimmy, me."
Even her brother.
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.
"Judge gave Jimmy and me ten years, like he was giving away candy."
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney Generals office.
"Toast, guys."
"Good trip, good life."
Get out soon.
"Good trip, sweetheart."
We'll watch the home front.
"Say hello to those blow-job hacks, huh?"
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
"I'll call you, uh, when I get a chance."
Now take me to jail.
"In prison, dinner was always a big thing."
"We had a pasta course, then we had a meat or a fish."
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt and he had a wonderful system for doing the garlic.
He used a razor and sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.
It was a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
"veal, beef, and pork."
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
"I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce."
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.
"I didn't put too much onions in, Paul."
You made me crazy.
"You,like,told me to look for the signs."
"Like bird poop and lightning bolts or,like,actual signs?"
"I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a lot of signage out there in the world."
I told you only to pay attention to the really obvious ones.
"The signs,thus far,have been conflicting."
Would you like me to come with you and show you the correct ones?
I could ring a bell and point.
"This is not about me,okay?"
A very nice person could get hurt.
Nice people get hurt every day.
"Sometimes,it's good for them."
"Did I,like,screw you out of land during the Renaissance or something?"
Why do you hate me so much?
- This is me liking you.
"- Well,can you stop?"
"And,seriously,how are you so slim?"
Here's what you got right.
Ready?
It's not just about you.
That's all you're getting.
"You want a burger,baby?"
No.
So how am I the stupidest person in the world?
When did that happen?
I think you've been working towards that for a while.
I am totally stuck.
I cannot break up with him again.
"He's the most loving,open guy."
All he wants to do is give and share.
The absolute worst word you can use to describe a guy is what?
"""Busty""? ""Emotional."""
***
"Something with, uh, a lot of saturated fats in, please."
And yes to any questions about making it larger.
Alright?
Eating off the bonnet of your car.
Yeah.
"Cause you don't want the smell to get in the fabrics, do you?"
"Yeah, that's why I'm doing it."
Nothing to do with not wanting my family to know anything.
"Well, I can't take it back to the surgery cause Mary doesn't allow it."
"But you're the boss, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
So you allow Mary not to allow it.
It's policy.
Mary is very good with policy.
"We all dream of a world where you can eat burgers at work, and wear aftershave on days when it isn't your birthday."
"But work's never going to be like that, is it?"
"Yes, very used to dealing with large purchasing budgets."
And what do you think you can bring to the surgery personally?
If anything at all.
"Well I've had a look around, and it works."
It's fine.
Yes?
But no offense...
What do you mean?
"I mean first off the waiting room,"
I mean would it kill us to get a couple of plasmas in there?
I hardly think a doctor's waiting room...
"I'm sorry, I'm talking to the doctor."
No.
"No, it wouldn't kill us."
Then do you want me to put some boiling water into the thermos?
You should wait for me.
How far away are you from the office to here?
Here.
Stamp it.
"You take the stamp, I'll keep the book."
"Everytime I run an errand, you stamp one."
It'll be completed after 200 stamps.
"You won't simply alter it, won't you?"
But what if you also have exact same stamp?
Then how about you hold onto the book as well?
I've already set up all the pages.
You got the stamp so you can't back out now.
"If that stamp is that important,"
Why didn't you just accept the check yesterday?
"I'm telling you, do you think money can solve everything?"
About the kiss... don't you think you should apologize for that?
The kiss?
"Hey, its only a hello."
"If an apology is not enough, you'll get rid of me, right?"
"You're just using me, aren't you?"
"Thanks to you, I wouldn't have to sit on the floor as well."
What's wrong?
It's not like it was your first kiss?
You.
Could it be...
Is it really like that?
Really?
Ah... please get it stamped quickly.
Really very unlucky.
Overarm throw.
From the side and below the armpit.
No.
Where's your mother?
I'm traveling all alone.
And you started wandering around the train and now you don't know where you're supposed to be?
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no!"
"I mean, I..."
"I do know where I'm supposed to be, in the day coach, but I don't like it there very much."
"I don't feel so good, right here."
I bet I know your problem.
You do?
Mmm-hmm.
"They gave you money to buy your dinner, and instead of that you bought some ice cream, and some candy and maybe some soda pop?"
"Yeah, and some marshmallows, and some cotton candy, and popcorn and cigarettes."
Cigarettes?
"Oh, I mean can-candy cigarettes, chocolate."
Oh!
Why don't you sleep here?
Here?
I'm sure your mother would want you looked after.
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no, don't do that."
Why?
"Oh, well, he doesn't like me, see, and... and he's not a nice man because we were talkin' about trains, and I told him I had 13 cars in my set,"
"and he only has 11, and he's jealous and nasty, he is."
"All right, then."
I'll ring for the porter.
"Oh, no."
"If you press that buzzer, I'll be killed!"
What an imagination!
"Well, don't you see?"
The porter and the conductor are in cahoots against me.
They stick his hand in this weird --
"I don't know, contraption and, while he's going through it, he's explaining to us that, like,"
"""oh!"
"It's taking a tissue sample."""
Ow!
And extrapolated it.
Some kind of accelerator?
Agh!
Are you all right?
I don't know.
"That's just -- and then, all of a sudden, this, like, gorgeous 16-year-old girl walks out of this unit and he's like"
"""Oh!"
"That's my daughter."""
Arm yourself.
Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Who is she?
"Well, she's -- well..."
She's my daughter.
"Hello, Dad."
"They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples from other people, which is weird."
"Now he's a father, which is a great way to have a kid."
"All those years, he didn't have to not sleep because the kid was up, crying, or having to go to school because of chickenpox."
"Hello, Dad."
"In the same way that Jenny came out of nowhere, at the end of the episode, she kind of awesomely goes into nowhere."
It's very sad.
The Doctor gets a clone and so then there's another Time Lord and you think about the potential for adventures and everything that he could've taught her and shown her and then it's snatched away so quickly.
"Jenny, be strong, now."
You need to hold on.
Do you hear me?
what did you come here for?
Revenge?
don't you?
Don't be so spoiled!
and forgot about the actual mission.
and entrust their lives to us will be exposed to danger.
Information from the satellite probe has revealed a shift in the magnetic field.
and it seems he's reached the heart.
There's no more time.
The situation is getting more and more difficult.
I think we need to take some kind of measures.
There is no need for that.
Macdougal will take care of it.
But General..!
one by one.
because the consciousness of our nation has been instilled in his head.
So this is Noah's ark.
It's bigger than I thought.
by a width is 50 cubits...
This is five times as big as that.
it's not made of any ordinary wooden material.
let alone destroy it.
This is the entrance.
Can't you open it?
material that has no time.
What did you say?
we can never destroy it.
It may not have even been created by human beings.
aren't you?
Machiner's Squad?
Yeah.
It's a Cyborg unit under the Pentagon.
"No, these places."
Poky little shops.
"Everything higgledy--piggledy, all scrunched in."
-
- Quaint!
-
"- Oh, good."
Do you think so?
Definitely!
"Good, because that was just the effect we were striving after."
"I said to the architect, ""Now, look, Sir Hugh,"" I said."
"""We don't want any of this modern rubbish."
"We'll go strictly for quaint."""
I love the smell.
"What is it, do you think?"
You've come on a bad day.
We get a lot of old people in here on a Tuesday.
"Which is fine, unless it's been raining, and then some of them smell a bit damp."
"I think it's cough drops, tobacco and paraffin."
That's right.
And that's only the women!
I see you're still selling things unwrapped.
"That's a vicious rumour, madam."
I've never even appeared in the shop unwrapped!
"Mind you, they do look tempting."
I might have risked a couple if you'd had tongs.
-
- Don't you use tongs?
-
- Of course we do.
I am notorious on the tongs.
But usually I just save them for the summer months because they are marvellous instruments for swatting flies.
"- Will you, I am leaving"
- Hold it
- Kanmani
"- Mom is calling me, I will go"
I was holding the cycle for you to learn
-Who will teach me then?
-Am I not here?
-You?
-Yes I am
- Do you know how to ride a cycle?
- Are you asking me?
I will give you a list of things I can ride
"Bike, Car, Lorry, Bus, Train, Aeroplane, Helicopter..."
- Do you know to ride a cycle?
- Why are you so doubtful?
"Trusting you, if I ride and suppose if you.."
..push me on someone and run away?
"I won't go to jail after pushing you over someone, listen to me"
- You ride and show me first
"- Move away, see now"
From that day to this day The sky has not changed
Man has changed Has mounted on the cycle...
Go singing like this
Oh God!
- Oh God!
- Dirty pig
Were you trying to cheat me?
Festival at coniamman temple Give donation
You don't look like people from temple
To prove that should we have a bell in hand?
- Give us the money
- Why do you drop 50 Rs?
Where is she?
This did not happen on my watch.
"When she clocked in I was still in my pj's, jamming to Luther Vandross."
"Wow, this is a beautiful setup."
They're running themselves?
"No, Mrs. R."
They're being run remotely.
Amanda Baylor.
Are you there?
ZIVA:
"Amanda Baylor, 28, unmarried, freelance encryption specialist, graduated from MIT with a degree in applied mathematics."
What else?
"That's pretty much it, boss."
"With the exception of a few personnel files from the Iron Crypt, it's like she doesn't exist."
"Well, she existed enough to have stolen that file from AUTEC and set up a pretty good alibi."
How often was she logged in at work when she wasn't actually there?
Can we link her to Phillip Wickes?
We have not been able to tie Baylor to anyone at Wickes Steel.
Not even the board stooges.
Wickes is still only talking to them and only about pushing paper.
What about a line from Amanda Baylor to our dead guy?
ZIVA:
"Baylor does not have a history with firearms, but it is still possible"
(phone rings) that she shot Ridgeway.
"Yeah, Abbs."
Tell her you're on your way.
I'm on my way.
"There, there it is."
I don't see it.
She's right.
There was a bounce.
Damn it.
"Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down right there.
You should have seen him.
His eyes were-were crazy.
Just 'cause he changed the channel?
"No, no, bro, wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first-class airfare, seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel all-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of The Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now."
"And since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue, we're throwing in $1 million!"
She's the reason that Dawkins broke out of prison?
She just won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
"Okay, but why her?"
"Like, there's not enough rich people on this island?"
"She's away from home, she's out of her element."
Maybe Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
I need everything on Dana.
Okay?
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rental."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
That's it.
It matches the description of the car Dawkins stole.
Five-O.
We'll take it from here.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
Food or water?
Filming real families has put me back.
"Let's tell the truth, here was the story."
But my position became more and more uncertain.
So I devised a plan to stay afloat.
"Carlos, let's get him out of here."
He heard what he said.
- I know how to get from A to B.
Do you mean B of Belgium?
- What about B of Bulgaria?
Thing?
- See those lovely ladies?
The legendary Sirens of the Sea of Mero.
Folk singers.
"Their concert was canceled,"
And tomorrow they will depart for Bulgaria by coach.
The protocol will never approve it.
"- Look, here's the plan."
I ride a music video for them and they let us get out of here.
Secretly.
Forget it.
Do not you want to bring the king home?
- Sure.
Maybe we should talk to her boss.
Sire.
- I can not concentrate.
You are welcome.
The coincidence between universes and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature and man...
"The desire for independence characterizes every epoch, right?"
"It gave birth to our kingdom in 1830, and now it will probably collapse."
But what is the real nature of this independence?
This so-called freedom?
All right.
Easy.
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.
"Yeah, we know who you are."
And we're not a threat to Candor.
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.
All I know for certain is you're both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation.
Those are lies.
"If you were Candor, I would take you at your word."
"Unfortunately, given the circumstances,"
I'm obliged to hand you over to the Council.
You can make your case there.
You might as well just kill us now.
"If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial."
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the Council.
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her?
You?
Factional law must be upheld.
"All right, wait, wait, wait."
Can I ask you one question?
(GRUNTS)
Can I ask you one question?
Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest.
Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you're so honest?
I admit I do hold that belief.
Then would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?
Hmm.
The answer is yes.
Where?
You can't defend him on this.
Where is he?
I don't know.
"I found this in the corner, under a shelf there."
"200 quid, stuffed in an old biscuit tin."
And here... shoe marks... size and pattern of which seem a good match for Julie-Ann's boots.
How far from here to where her body was found?
300-400 yards.
Possible she was dragged all that way?
Possible.
This could be where she was strangled.
That money you found at the lock-up matches the notes Julie-Ann stole from her dad.
"Well, we know she was doing a deal with O'Duncie."
"After she left the squat, she needed a secure location to stash the money until the deal was in place."
So she gave it to David to hang on to?
But why did he turn the garage upside-down?
He'd know where it was.
- To destroy the crime scene?
- She's nervous.
"O'Duncie has already beaten up Eddie, so she's not gonna trust anyone with £200, and doesn't tell David where she's hidden it."
"Then on the 13th, David Bentley wants to know where the money is."
And ends up throttling her.
- We've found the Bentley van.
"- Yes, sarge."
Let's go.
Sarge.
The list of Bentley associates and their last-known addresses.
- You sent cars out?
- Sergeant Harris thought you'd coordinate.
WPC Tennison...
What does that look like to you?
We're talking here.
"Who's, uh, who's slow joel?"
"You know joel.He comes by the house a couple times a year.He's got the pushed-in nose, scars under the eyes."
Wears the pull-down wool cap.
Talks like marlee matlin.
"Oh.Oh, that guy is jolting' joel johansson?"
"Was joltin' joel, is slow joel."
"Hey, it's not my fault he kept dropping his goddamn hands like sugar ray leonard."
The guy was an ape trying to be a hot dog.
"But you're smarter than that, franco.You can move."
And lou made a lot of money with jolting' joel.
"I mean, the side action on these fights are over the moon."
Yeah.
And now he shits his pants twice a day.
"Tommy, why don't you go be a pain in the ass somewhere else?"
We're talking here.
Ok.Don't forget to mention the glass eye.
"Uh, the what?"
"It's totally unrelated.He got excited, hit himself in the face with a fork."
Joel loved a good meal.
What do you think?
"I don't know, guys."
"I've been in the ring before, you know, lou."
Think I'll just stick to hitting the heavy bag.
Bag don't hit back if you know what i mean.
"Ah, come on.I'm serious here, franco, you got real talent."
This could be huge with the right guidance.
"Yeah.Well, you know, I'm just not to keen on messing with the catnip, you know."
End up looking like mickey rourke.
He looked good in sin city.
He was animated.
"Look, franc, man was not meant to hit 80 pounds of sand hanging from a ceiling."
It was Henry's first tea of the day.
"Ground hemlock is brown, Henry's teacup was brown."
The powder could have been placed in his cup earlier that morning and George wouldn't have noticed.
"So in theory, anybody could have done it?"
I need to find Iris Lightman.
"Her anger when Henry refused to help her expose the ""Max"" character was palpable."
"What about Edie, with all her money worries?"
"She's hasn't exactly been all sweetness and light, has she?"
What did happen to all that cash that Edie's father had?
Vernon had money?
"Oh, yeah."
He made an absolute fortune on the black market during the war.
I had no idea.
"Sid, I've got a small job for you."
I want you to find out who Vernon's solicitor was.
"Sidney, your nails are filthy."
"You know me, Mrs M, always happy to get my hands dirty."
Ta-ta.
He's helping Edie out in her garden.
Sidney Carter in a garden!
She needs all the help she can get.
Which is why I've decided to enter best bouquet in the flower competition on her behalf.
You?
You're serious?
Perfectly.
A first prize could be very good publicity for her right now.
First prize?
I did flower arranging at finishing school.
I doubt you've ever read Constance Spry.
"No, I have not, and neither has the Father."
"Fortunately, he and I are of one mind when it comes to the floral aesthetic."
"Well, we will see about that."
Just switching things up a little bit.
"You know, it's like having breakfast for dinner."
Mmm!
"Now, about this van, I mean, it really is a super-cool idea for the future."
"- I mean, it's like the perfect plan."
- I haven't told you the plan.
"Great, cause I do not understand it."
"I think I've found an untapped market that, if properly assessed, may be poised... to explode."
"Okay, I get it."
"It's like you have a huge pile of dynamite, and you just lit the fuse."
I can see it right now--
I still haven't told you the idea.
"Great, 'cause I still don't understand it."
I'm gonna show you.
"And, mom, trust me, this isn't some, like, get-rich-quick plan."
"Oh, like your dad's idea for the reverse microwave, where it makes the food cold?"
Reverse microwave's a good idea in a world where a freezer doesn't exist.
Mom...
"[ Sighs ] you believe in me, right?"
Of course.
[ Both laugh ]
You think you maybe want to put on some pants today?
Pants are for closers.
I'm a bum.
What are you doing?
I always do that.
It turns me on.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What is it?
I was thinking about how you lost your mayor's job.
Stupid city council impeached me.
- There's no actual dolphins or boys.
"- (Stephen) No, it's..."
He's really short.
Stands on a box.
Or she...
They had to dig a trench for her.
Five to you.
She had to stand and walk about in a trench.
"The interesting thing about Alan Ladd was he was only, like, four foot three, but it was all his legs that were short."
"Like, his trunk was normal."
"- Sat down, he was taller than most people."
- Is that true?
Good heavens.
"But when he stood, yeah, they had to put him on a little apple crate."
I never know with you.
That's what's so worrying.
"- No, it's absolutely true."
- (laughter)
"Alan Ladd was to recall working with Sophia Loren in Boy on a Dolphin, that ""Working with her was like being bombarded by watermelons""."
- Ha!
- (Stephen) Exactly.
Thank you.
"For the sake of our audience who hadn't quite got that image, thank you for it."
As Woody Allen - Mr Konigsberg - once pointed out:
"""Sex between a man and a woman can be wonderful, provided you get between the right man and the right woman""."
"Now, lastly on the subject of Alans, what would you do with a pair of Alans?"
Australians should know this because it's one of the particular ways of speaking
"Australia shares with Britain, or particularly with London."
- Alan Whickers.
- Alan Whickers.
Knickers.
There you are.
What's going on here?
Tracing back our history... too.
I think Noah has another function besides controlling the atmosphere.
that no one would believe such a fact.
That just maybe the countless dinosaurs and other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark were probably used in experiments for creating the life forms that would carry on the next generation.
What are these things?
Noah's other function is that of a life-creating device.
Professor?
Isn't it incredible?
"The history of the human race was created within this ""Noah's ark!"
let us build a new world with our hands.
Worthless.
That is your wish.
Mankind has progressed in the wrong way.
Man is the only defective work that God created.
Are you trying to put Man on trial in place of God?
We must do it now.
I want the two of you to create new life forms for the next generation using Noah.
Professor.
Come let's do it.
No.
Damn!
Where the hell are the Doc and the others?
What did you just say?
I said no.
You're insane.
I see.
Then it can't be helped.
What are you going to do?
Get a fire extinguisher..!
Quickly!
Run!
I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus III.
Probably.
Rank hath its privileges.
"How well we both know that, huh?"
Scotty.
- Kirk here.
"- Travers, Jim."
We're waiting.
"Good, commodore."
We're on our way.
Be sure to bring along your tactical people.
I've got an interesting problem for them.
"We'll beam down immediately, commodore."
Kirk out.
"Captain, I wonder why he's so insistent that our tactical aides come down."
"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of nowhere."
He probably wants additional advice.
"Perhaps, captain, but nevertheless, I..."
"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality?"
"I, for one, could use a good nonreconstituted meal."
"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
You bet your pointed ears I am.
"Ready whenever you are, captain."
Energize.
- Kirk to Enterprise.
Red alert.
"- What is it, captain?"
Cestus III has been destroyed.
"Space, the final frontier."
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission:
"To explore strange, new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
"I mean, something to give it a little pizzazz instead of, like I said, look like a bomb shelter."
"This was Lou's only major building in Philadelphia, and I wanted to like it."
But I had to agree it was kind of disappointing.
"Around this time, an article appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer about my search."
"It quoted me as saying that I wanted to hug my father's buildings, which was very embarrassing, but it stirred things up."
"I got several letters, including one from a relative of Lou's who was a rabbi."
He said that he'd officiated at Lou Kahn's funeral and Lou Kahn didn't have a son.
Hello?
- Is this Rabbi Kramer?
- Yes.
"Yeah, hi."
This is Nathaniel Kahn calling.
"God in heavens, the whole world opened up, my friend."
What are you talking about?
"I mean, gosh, I've been raising hell with the Inquirer."
"I said, ""Find that man."""
You're raising hell with the Inquirer?
- Why are you doing that?
"- To find you, sir."
"Oh, well, I'm glad you did find me."
"Look, don't forget Lou Kahn's my first cousin."
Lou Kahn is your first cousin?
And my parents was his godparents.
"Wow, I didn't know that."
"Well, I knew Lou very well."
"With all due respect, I hear Lou fooled around."
"Well, you know..."
"Anyway, I'm here, so that's a good thing."
What would you do with the film once you...
"Oh, it'll be on... it'll be on TV, you know."
- Wow.
"- Yeah, so..."
Bad news.
There's more red tape around that thing than I have ever seen.
"The good news is, I have a talent for badgering people until they give me what I need."
Hard to believe.
Wickes is lying low for a reason.
I think he eliminated the only remaining connection between his company and AUTEC.
I think he saw us snooping around.
I think he sent us straight to Ridgeway's door.
"I mean, who would suspect him?"
You.
(phone chimes)
Your son?
"You're not the only one who can spot a tell, Doc."
Parker's a funny kid.
He's trying to wrangle fast food out of my sister.
(laughs) No.
You got pictures?
Your surveillance pictures weren't good enough?
"By the way, bad of me."
"Well, that's not the kind of Kodak moment I was thinking."
(laughs)
He was just little when he gave it to me.
He used to love boats almost as much as you do.
"He said it was the two of us, and that we were on this boat, sailing away, happy."
He wanted to take you away.
Who's playing doctor now?
(phone ringing)
"Yeah, McGee."
"Boss, I finally got the IP for the computer used to hack into AUTEC."
Belongs to a government consultant named Amanda Baylor.
So that's our computer genius?
An encryption specialist.
"Secondly, she prefers the term"
"""Adult Film Thespian."""
"And thirdly, I had a very good conversation with her, and hopefully, she's gonna stop doing..."
"Hundreds of men, women and objects?"
She doesn't do objects.
"She has a standard contract, and she doesn't do objects."
"She doesn't do animals, and she doesn't do water sports."
Although I don't really know what that is.
I think that's...
doing it on a jet ski?
"Oh, boy."
Yep.
Why would anyone want to do that on a jet ski?
"Okay, so what?"
- Were you able to talk her out of it?
- I think so.
Although she did most of the talking.
"If it wasn't for you, I never would have gotten to where I am today."
Thank you.
"You made me fall in love with math, Aaron."
"And with those skills, I've learned to invest my money, run my own website, and create a healthy and diversified portfolio."
That's cool.
That is really cool.
"You know, I think that I'm just curious if-if maybe you're interested in expanding."
"Oh, I totally do!"
I'm gonna start my own reality show where I take other porn stars out to dinner.
It's called Stuffing Liza Blue's Face.
Wow.
Great title.
God.
"You know, I love how encouraging you are."
That's why I've always had such a big crush on you.
"Oh, doctor!"
Doctor.
Good to see you.
How is our Gyung Joon?
Ah yes...
I see...
That he hasn't regained his consciousness yet.
"They say his body is all fine, so why isn't he waking up?"
"You don't think he's going to stay in that state like that, right?"
They say there's nothing wrong...
So I'm sure he'll wake up.
They say that people can stay in a state like that for several years.
Then what do we do about him?
Do we have to keep on taking care of him?
Doctor...
"That won't happen, right?"
"If by any chance, that happens, what are you going to do?"
Doctor.
We don't have the relationship where we have to take responsibility for him.
We're just relatives who have been left in charge for the time being.
The hospital shouldn't be asking us what should be done with him in the future.
-Honey!
-What?
Doctor...
"Then, goodbye."
"Ugh, this boy..."
Isn't there somewhere in America where we can send him off to just in case?
Who would take care of him?
"Since he grew up there, there has to be someone he was close to!"
It's because there was no such person that he came to Korea!
What should we do with his belongings?
-Gyung Joon...
"Until I touch their corpses with my own hands,"
I won't believe they are dead!
Where do you expect them to be?
"They're dead, I tell you."
It's as if I can see them.
I can feel them watching me.
Their spirit is searching my head to find me.
Their hatred won't leave me!
I know theywill return.
They can think of nothing else but me.
They're looking for me in order to take their revenge.
"Dead or alive, I know they will be back."
I know they will be back.
I saw them in the tavern!
They were covered in blood.
They were watching me.
"You don't care, do you?"
You weren't there.
You don't believe in ghosts!
You're nothing but a trollop.
No.
"No, you can't make me forget them."
They will kill us!
They came back from the dead... to tear us apart.
Good for them if they are alive!
I will kill them like wicked creatures.
I want to strangle them.
I want to feel their bones breaking between my fingers.
"I want to overpower them, drink their blood and wounds."
I'll smash them with my heels and you'll be there to see it.
There will be nothing left of them
Nothing!
Okay.
I'll get corroboration from another source.
Thank you.
"All right, Dad, what did we do wrong this time?"
Nothing. I just... I have something I have to tell you guys.
is somebody sick?
"No, sweetie, it's nothing like that."
"Something has happened at work, or because of work, and I don't know that it's bad yet."
"It's too soon to tell, but it might be bad."
- You're going broke?
"- No, but I suppose it could happen."
- There's an investigation of Atlantor.
- By the police?
"Sort of, yeah."
It's called a grand jury.
- [Eli] That's serious.
- [Jessie] Do you get arrested?
"No, honey."
"No, no."
It's not like that.
[Jessie] Then what's wrong?
"Well, I'm not exactly sure, and that's part of the problem."
"There are some people who could be arrested,"
- l guess.
- But not you.
"Well, there's nothing they would arrest me for."
We should not worry about this before anything...
You're saying you could be arrested?
"Well, anything's possible, E, but, no, I really don't think that that's what this is about."
"Jess, honey, listen, listen to me."
"I do not think anything bad is going to happen, okay?"
"I can't guarantee you that, and I'm sorry."
"Just take your time, and while you're at it, you might want to tighten your socks, because they're about to get knocked off."
Why did you tell him that we have a great idea?
"Honey, what do you think, one's just gonna walk in the front door?"
"And now, thanks to you,"
I have to wear this stupid eye patch.
It's not my fault.
Face it.
"You liked me when I was mousy, and now that that's changed, you can't handle it."
Nonsense!
All I've ever been is a protective big sister.
"Then how come when you had an eyebrow-waxing business, you never got rid of my unibrow?"
Why would you want me to?
So you could be sexy for God?
That's sick.
So tell me the idea.
"It's a story about two sisters,"
Joy and Jill.
One was mousy her whole life because she was a mouse.
Ah!
"They're both mice, and the other mouse was always the beautiful one."
"Right, but then, they switched."
Sounds interesting.
"You know, mice do well in focus groups."
Melanie and I are artists.
We don't cater to focus groups.
And how does your story end?
"Well, what kind of endings do focus groups like?"
The kind that are in my hand by Monday.
Then you will have it by Sunday.
What is wrong with you?
I'm ready.
How do I look?
And another foot.
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.
When is TSA finally gonna realize that we all know the shoe thing?
You know what I mean?
"You get to the airport, they tell you to take your shoes off."
"It's like, ""Who doesn't know by now?"""
"Is someone getting to the airport, like, ""What?"
"I have to take my shoes off?"""
"If that happens, arrest and kill that person."
"They're probably not terrorists, but they're holding up the line."
And what is terrorism on a local level?
"On a local level, what is terrorism?"
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.
"""When did this start?"" ""Kill him!"""
"And I'm way too far back. ""Kill him!"
In front of everybody!
Everybody watches!
Everyone.
"No, sweetie, everyone watches."
Everyone.
Everyone watches.
Everyone watches.
"Never become that."""
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation the moment you start dealing with security.
"No one gets dressed and undressed while moving sideways at home, but goddamn it if you're not an Olympian when you get there."
Hurry up!
"People in tears, like, ""I just want to see my family again!"
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?
"Oh, my God!"
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!
- But she's not saying that now.
- She's lying.
She's a prime candidate for severe...
I want to be sure she doesn't have post partum depression just as much as you do.
But it can be one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose.
"And if the patient is in complete denial or lying to me, not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her."
I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
I'm sorry.
- Need a hand?
- I need eight.
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
What's this?
Driver of our auto-versus-pedestrian.
The guy ran out in front of me.
"Please, give me something."
"No neck pain, no chest pain, good vitals, but complains of bilateral thumb pain."
Look at this.
I can't even make a fist.
And we're out of beds.
"Okay, let's park him."
I'll see what I can do.
"Dr. Weaver, Psych's refusing to admit Judy Anderson."
Psych?
I believe her condition was a deliberate act.
"Yes, I know you suspect postpartum depression,"
- but did she admit it?
- Practically.
She drove head-on into a wall.
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.
ER.
Please hold.
- Like what?
- Her bite mark on his hand.
You call that evidence?
(Travis laughing)
I warn all the spectators not to get too close to her cage.
That only proves the man can't listen to sound advice.
- When did the victim see her?
- How would I know?
Lots of people come through.
She's quite the attraction.
"Now, where you keeping her?"
She's in better hands than yours.
(Fen grunting and panting)
"You're safe here, Fen."
Safe.
No one will hurt you.
(Fen grunting)
(Fen panting)
Would you like to listen to some music?
(Fen grunting)
(piano and guitar music playing)
(Fen panting more slowly)
(Fen grunting)
What are you trying to say?
William.
You're just in time to see these gestures she's making.
- (Fen grunting)
- What do they mean?
I have no idea.
They require further observation.
"But her appearance, her choice in food, the scars; they all suggest she's been living in the wild for some time."
Fascinating.
What'd you expect?
Nothing short of a triple axe murder will take it off.
"Keep feeding the press, morning and night."
Emphasize our tough stand on crime.
The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year.
"Also, Stern's record."
Hard-line.
"Good, Kevin."
Corporation Council?
We've commissioned a study that'll prove this city has the toughest probation guidelines in the country.
Excellent.
Get Community Affairs involved.
Tell Parks clean up their playgrounds.
"Hover, nudge, show we care."
And then we got to do something concrete.
"Something big, something important."
Something that means jobs.
That means building BankExchange.
I won't let these shootings interfere with my program for the city.
I'm speaking at the boy's funeral.
James Bone's funeral.
That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?
Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened.
They want the subway stop to raise their land value on city property.
The property around BankExchange?
It was my fault.
- What you sorry about?
I am not.
Then let's just say that we were foolish and next time we'll drink to one another's health.
I suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.
Yes.
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.
"Well, goodbye and good luck."
"Come on, John."
Don't be stuffy.
"After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else."
I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment.
"- What do you mean, ""off moment""?"
"- Yours, according to your theory."
"I imagine what I just witnessed was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good, huh?"
Correct?
"Yes, yes."
"I don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack."
"But one which would have been repulsed even without your help, John."
Wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
That's where you'll find me from tonight on until I get what I'm looking for.
"I'm worried, John."
- He ought to have let us know.
- He'll be along.
"Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll."
That wasn't my son in there.
It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart.
My poor Sam.
"- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home."
"- Yes, sir."
- I'll walk.
"You're next, your song."
"Oh, my song."
We'll continue this later.
* Your eyes are simpatico
* Tonight they have told me
* That you'll be simpatico
* To me alone
* Your arms are simpatico
* And when they enfold me
* They hold me within a spell
* No lover has known

"Those are my orders, I can't stand hooligans."
You've come at a good time.
It's about the meeting.
"I told the boss, he wants us to follow procedure."
"You know what to do, so get over there."
What are you doing here?
"Take the kids, quick!"
"Come here, Naou."
"Wait here, I'll be back in a while."
"Good day, Touré."
How are you?
And the family?
"Today I've come to thank you, for the work you did with my wife."
It was a complete success.
My wife adores me.
And all thanks to God and your work.
- I thank you.
- Give thanks to God!
To his Grace!
"Today, my main concern in this visit... is the factory."
"In these violent times, it's enough to wear a new shirt... to awaken envy, even if the person... is not concerned."
I come to you for protection.
I've told you Traoré is evil.
"And now the workers have stopped working, to go to the meeting."
Who could have lightened the work load?
It's the new engineer.
He's reduced the cloth price.
"And when such a person calls a meeting, to discuss our problems, I think it's... something good, that we should... all value."
What do you say?
You're right.
"Our union delegates are a bunch of stool-pigeons, trust them... and you'll bury yourself alive."
So let's fire them!
I am an Allied agent and I need your help.
- Is Major George Stirling here?
- That's me.
It's an honor to meet you.
"I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout."
The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.
I'm not risking these men's lives for anything less than a solid plan.
"If we're gonna turn things around, we need to do something now."
You can't just wait here to die.
- We're digging a tunnel.
- Danny.
You can trust me.
"I broke in for you, didn't I?"
- We're clearing a foot a day.
- When do you expect to finish?
"Three months, give or take."
Then we're all getting out.
- We don't have that much time.
- Time 'til what?
I can't say.
"But we have weeks, not months."
It's an important operation.
It could make the difference.
We need your most experienced men.
"Your strongest, to help train civilian recruits."
So what's your plan?
Next time on work detail
I'll give a signal.
My team will provide covering fire while we break for the woods.
Ahh!
They said you told them nothing at the gate.
"You are a mystery, and I am a curious person."
Good.
Nigar Kalfa will be with her
She'd never leave her alone
I'm relieved.
I won't have to worry about her
I wonder whose idea it was to send her there
Our Valide Sultana agreed to it
Nigar Kalfa will be more beneficial there than she was here
I came here for...
His Majesty gave me this lucky charm when I got pregnant to Mehmet
What an elegant amulet
Yeah
I always carried it at the birth of my children
It supported me
I want to gift it to Hatice Sultana
Is that how you ask for forgiveness?
Good idea
That is a very valuable gift
Our Sultana will be happy
Let's visit her some time
Will you accompany me?
Of course
We'll visit her first thing tomorrow
Wow wow
Such great things
If you want we can place one infront of your house
No my Paşa.
I'm not a Paşa.
I'm a poor man
They'd make fun of me
"My Paşa, they'll annoy you too"
Because the ones who saw these at port were already gossiping
Uh-huh.
"That money was for the poor, John."
"Look, I'm not saying I took the money, but maybe the kid that did..."
And I'm just spitballing here...
Maybe that kid needed a new mitt.
"And maybe his mom didn't have the cash to get him one, so, you know, if you think about it, that kid was kind of poor too."
"That box is for the people who don't have food to eat, John."
"Listen, I heard about your dad, and we've been praying for him."
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
"You know, those candles don't work unless you put $3 in them."
"Oh, yeah?"
Oh.
You have change for a 5?
I do not.
But I'll take the fiver.
We'll consider it down payment on the 40.
"Of course I took the money, Brian, but that mitt was sweet."
"Rawlings, heart of the hide."
- The gold glove model?
- Top of the line.
I spent the entire off-season working that thing in.
"Rubbing oil on it, tied a baseball up in it."
"My first game back, I made this sweet diving catch on a liner right up the middle, oh!"
"But then you left it on the bus or lost it somewhere 'cause you were subconsciously trying to punish yourself, right?"
"Hell, no."
I used that mitt all the way up to college.
Still have it.
"23 years, it's the longest relationship I've ever been in."
- Hmm.
- I love that mitt.
We should go out and throw sometime.
"What is important for a journalist, is to keep readers in suspense, so they'll want to buy the newspaper."
At the expense of the truth?
I never wrote anything false.
I just give enough elements so the reader can imagine what he wants.
"I'm losing my mind, you know."
Elizabeth our only chance to clarify this story is to remain united.
I ask you to do that for your brother.
And for me.
We're going to choose the cake.
Okay.
Which one?
This one.
What is it?
Who is there?
"The injection, quick!"
Pick up the list.
It is on the desktop.
Here it is.
You're lucky.
"If you had not saved me from the guillotine in the past,"
I would have strangled you.
To leave this list lying about...
Fortunately the police didn't find it.
I did not realize when you had asked me to pick it up.
It is you who have written it on this desktop.
I thought that you had taken it.
This is a misunderstanding.
The incident is closed.
It remains to know whether the girl has seen it.
The sheet was returned.
"Yes, but you never know."
"And when in doubt, I do not abstain."
[tense music]
His readings could triangulate when wind and sound
- make contact with an object.
- How does that help us?
"If we can pinpoint the precise point of impact every time wind hits that object,"
I think I can build a 3D outline of what the crime scene looked like.
You can get me a face?
"If his data's reliable,"
I'll be able to show you who killed Roger before you're done with dinner.
You just signed your new client.
Give him what he wants.
[computer beeping]
[footsteps approaching]
"Dad, what're you doing?"
I was thinking we might go camping.
Like in the backyard?
"Uh, no, a little further than that."
I thought we could head up north.
Thought we could sleep under the stars just for a while.
Doesn't that sound fun?
We'd go outside the wall?
"Well, yes."
Would we have to go through the Red Zone to get there?
Since when have you been worried about the Red Zone?
"My Spiga Scout leader says bad people live there, and they hate us."
That's why we have the wall.
"Hazel, your scout leader is a dummy."
"Now, come on."
We'd be together the whole time.
We'd share an adventure.
You and me.
"- I don't wanna go there, Dad."
I'm certainly not turning them over to you
To be stolen the next time you feel sleepy.
"Agent carter,"
How did you come to discover the stolen items?
"Leet brannis, uh, told me where they were."
And how did you come into contact with mr.
Brannis?
I have been conducting my own private investigation
Have you been in contact with him since his disappearance?
"Are you collaborating with stark,"
A known traitor and fugitive from justice?
Publicly revealing these items won't clear mr.
Stark's name.
They'll only place you under suspicion along with him.
Do you see the day I've had?
"I will call them in, and they will respect me."
But they won't.
They'll only use it to tear you down.
If you wish to clear mr.
"Stark's name,"
You must do so from the shadows.
There's a phone box across the street.
"But for god's sake, don't let krzeminski get hold of it."
Sousa's working the office tonight.
I can just about stomach him getting the credit.
"Oh, and, uh, mr."
"Jarvis, they know your voice now."
Sousa.
"Hey, mack, I, uh,"
Got a hot tip for ya.
"Yeah, howard stark's stolen inventions."
They're... they're...
"Oh, yes."
No.
"Yeah, probably, I am."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Well... it was a great two-and-a-half dates.
And I'd be willing to round it up to three if you want to.
I don't think so.
"I hope you're sure about this, because once I leave, I'm not coming back."
Unless you want me to.
"Bye, New Christine."
Bye.
That is one hot grandpa.
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
Please tell me.
What can you achieve by talking?
What can be achieved?
That is already out of control.
"Soon, I'll be killed by that."
"To you, it doesn't matter if you survive or die, but to me, I must definitely kill it."
"In order to do that, I need you to talk."
"The one who turned it into a demon was you, and thus, you have an obligation to talk."
Obligation?
It is just a grudge filled story.
"I have wasted my life living to this age, to actually be intimidated by that..."
Final Act
"That girl, Tamaki was a sacrificial offering."
"It slowly became inevitable, as if and leaned towards me."
"Because of how things ended up, it would have been pitiful if I had taken her home."
"So, I let her wear beautiful clothes and eat delicious food."
It closed a Iong time ago.
I'm just kidding
"Everyone, look who's here!"
Aren't you...
Rin!
It's been ages!
"We've selected promising students, and assigned them to the lacrosse and beach volleyball teams."
"In order to promote such disciplines, we plan to produce comics and novels."
We're working on sports entertainment and documentary film programs.
"We've set up a dedicated Internet server, and will soon launch a blog."
This chart shows the expected investment results.
Enough about investments.
Is this marketable or not?
There are two things worth investing in.
Power and beauty.
The days of investment in power are numbered.
This leaves beauty.
sell beauty.
The meeting's over.
The old Ms. Isezaki asked...
"Oh, he's gone."
Why did the dojo close?
I don't really know.
It was very sudden.
"But I had a premonition, you know."
"But if everyone else had no idea, it must've been a shock for them."
However I...
I've checked on the author of the article.
Remember me?
I'm Rin Sakurazawa.
Rin Sakurazawa!
Rin!
"If I go there, I got to shop around."
I'm too lazy to choose.
"You can go out, just to hang out."
It's fun.
"What do you mean, ""go out just to hang out?"""
Go out just to hang out you know?
I don't get it.
What are you saying?
Sometimes I think you are messing with me.
I'm not messing with you.
Why would I do that?
What do you find entertaining?
Hmm...
Thinking of new projects.
Hey that is work.
No.
Work is when someone hires us to do something.
This is thinking of stuff to do on our own.
Then how about sports?
Sports?
I like to play badminton but I have no one to play with.
You don't meet up with your friends at all?
I meet them sometimes at funerals and weddings.
"But I can't really invite anyone out, since my schedule always changes."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Dang!
This has anything to do with my rash?
Seriously.
"Some people think there is no link, but a patient's lifestyle has an effect on their disease."
"And if I don't, what is your medical opinion on having one or not?"
It actually depends on the person.
"Some people have one and it's good, but for some, it's bad."
"- We're all gonna die, Elliot."
The only question is when and how?
What?
You pulled Bianco's LUDs?
Swell.
- Fin?
- Yeah.
Amy Solwey's been calling Bianco.
Everyone who needs a kidney knows about Russ Bianco.
What's the big deal?
"Well, you called him a couple dozen times over the last two months."
You're at the top of the NTCC list.
What do you need a guy like that for?
Insurance.
In case my next transplant doesn't work.
Really?
What is Bianco paying you to find buyers for his hot kidneys?
I do it for nothing.
"Going to jail for assisted suicide didn't teach you a damn thing, did it?"
Sure it did.
Now I help people live instead of die.
"Amy, you're still breaking the law."
Arrest me.
"We don't want you, we want the surgeon who's performing the transplants."
He's saving lives.
"Give us his name, or you're going back to jail."
No jail's worse than living in the prison of a sick body.
You'll be living in both when they take your name off that transplant list.
That would never happen.
"When the NTCC finds out that you've been trafficking in black market kidneys, they're gonna cross you right off the list."
You'd let me die?
Give us the surgeon's name.
Dalton.
"Hi, it's Megan."
"Oh, hi, how are ya?"
How's it going?
"Oh, it's goin' fine."
"Our lab boys picked up a bloody footprint in the, uh, meat packing plant."
"They, uh, matched it with a size 10 hunting boot, manufactured by a firm in Maine."
He only sells mail order.
"Well, you think he's from Maine?"
"Well, our computer checked their records with all sale of that size with army records, and we finally have us some suspects."
Why do you think he was in the army?
"Well, uh, one of the ghoul's girlfriends picked out the m-16 machine gun as a weapon the ex..."
"Uh, the exterminator used when he broke up their party."
About the only way you can get one is stealing it from the army.
You think you're gonna catch him?
"Oh, we'll-we'll catch him, all right."
But it's gonna take some doing.
"The computer gave us 2,000 suspects."
Now it's gonna take a lot of knocking on a lot of doors.
What are you doing right now?
"Uh, well, I'm a just going over some lab reports and just lookin' for clues."
Do you want to take a break?
Yeah.
"Well, there's a good jazz concert at battery park."
"All right, I, uh..."
I can be there in about thirty minutes.
Good.
"Okay, see you there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Stan guest."
[Applause]
[Music playing]
Megan?
"You have motive, the insurance money."
Or not giving Gus his cut.
Gus and I have been friends since college.
He did me a favor by showing here.
I would never betray him.
"Okay, um, let's say I believe you."
Who else has the password?
"Besides myself, my assistant and Gus."
Why would Gus have it?
"He's been working around the clock, putting finishing touches on his pieces for the exhibit."
He was taking photos as late as last week.
Are you looking for suspects?
I'll give you suspects.
"What about the guy who wrecked my work three years ago, huh?"
Or what about those jerks that stole my painting from the museum last month?
Why aren't you guys out there looking for them?
"Because you're lying about something, Mr. Walker."
I don't e.
"I don't lie in my life and not in my work, got it?"
Someone besides me wanted my art off these walls.
Go find them!
(Colin) Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
He didn't hurt us.
It's just that I don't think it was random.
What do you mean?
"Well, the mugger went for my bag first."
He only seemed to take Sondra's purse as an afterthought.
You know that thing Angela got from the cleaners?
I think the mugger thought I had it in my bag.
"You know, luckily, I didn't."
There's part of it I just--I can't--
Stealing glances at these papers?
"Yeah, that made me suspicious."
Can't we just forget all this?
"You're walking out that door, and you're never seeing her again."
Who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Jack Stillman.
The Fixer.
"The I.R.S. says he made $16 million last year working for media companies, politicians--"
And the occasional crime figure.
I understand that I'm a person of interest to you.
Who told you that?
"I know everything that happens in this city, Special Agent."
"You interfere with this investigation again, whether it be paying people to lie or encouraging them to withhold evidence,"
"I'll bring you down, Stillman."
"Well, you're welcome to try."
But I should warn you that better people than you have failed.

"Oh, see, now, this is good art."
It tells a story.
Good art has to tell a story?
"Can't it inspire a feeling, set a mood?"
It's funny.
When Dana and I went to the museum last weekend--
"Man, that's the fourth Dana reference today."
[laughing] That's not--
That's not true.
Really?
Four?
Four.
And that already includes two about the museum.
Right.
We were sort of dating on and off then I found out that he got this super model pregnant.
I didn't even want to come out tonight and I ran into them.
"And I just, I don't know I just can't hit the Hollywood scene anymore."
It's just... not for me.
Wow I didn't even know you were dating anyone.
I thought you were...
I thought you were single.
Well slightly single.
I mean it was never anything fully committed.
Well breakups are always pretty tough.
I just don't get this town?
"Everyone is always on the search for the bigger, better deal."
It's just...
Yeah but you know it's all about hype right?
"I mean at the end of the day that's all it is, is hype."
Well yeah but it's different when you're famous.
You're part of the something better that people are searching for.
I am the exact same person that I've always been.
I'm not in this business for the hype.
Hey ZACH!
Come here.
Am I going to be on the cover of a tabloid as your newest squeeze?
I think I can handle that.
I'm so sorry.
It's Ok I like a good head butt...
that was...
"I was, meant to kiss your cheek and..."
I am such an idiot.
He was clearly going for the lips.
OK well have a good night.
Thanks bye.
- Go.
- Ain't you joining?
I joined last month.
"- Hey, I wanna ask a question."
- Yeah?
"If we joined up, don't we get a uniform or something?"
"Man, the Black Legion's got the doggonest uniform you ever laid eyes on."
"One that will throw fear into the hearts of all them rotten, ungrateful foreigners."
One bar ain't enough.
It goes to prove it.
The man was hungry and there should be two bars a day because--
He eats as much as we all do.
"Say, are you gonna let him bust in on me like that?"
"What do you mean, talking to the judge like that, you mug?"
"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but let me explain something."
There should be two bars a day.
One in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Do I have to put up with that little slug interrupting all the time?
You two guys better get along together.
I'll kick you both out of court.
"Okay, the state rests."
What do you do?
"Oh, we rest too."
Then the jury will retire and consider a verdict.
"- Hey, Butch."
"- Yes, sir?"
Come here.
- When did you see Jim last?
"- Oh, about an hour ago in the dormitory."
Yeah.
I'll look him up and have a talk with him.
Didn't I tell you everything would be all right?
"I use to told you that this Laxmi Narayan, will make her mother's dream come true."
I proud of you.
How many bullets you have shoot on throat.
None.
You much have cut him.
Kill by pushing the throat?
How cheap your mentality is Bhai... just like egg of lizard.
"Do not take life, give life to become Bhai(brother)"
You should learn some.
I am not cheep Bhai like you.
Who do business in diamonds and take others life.
I thought you have reputation.
But now i know that you have no reputation.
Did you kill her or not?
No.
Because i want to become Godfather.
"Godfather, even Chota Khujli can become father too."
But one can become God when he give life.
And today i saved her life here's your diamonds.
From today we have separate ways.
"Because i wont work for cheep Bhai like you, who sopil the name of underworld, for a underwear."
Check you diamonds and Chota Khujli marry your daughter with some Aslam Bhoda etc.
Now i don't have any interest in her.
What is this?
Diamond.
Is this diamond?
"Yeah see its written here too, pure diamond."
See this.
Where would i wear this diamond?
"Its you own choice, why you are asking me?"
"Check it carefully, Laxmi Narayan don't left any work undone."
What!
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"- Excuse me, the DEA?"
- Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
I understand that.
What does that have to do with the DEA?
They're after some mystery man some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up."
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Wait, wait."
"Look, I just..."
I think...
I just think that we should review our options.
Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
You got a grand total of two.
Option A:
Brandon takes the deal.
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
"Look, look."
What about reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge?"
What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about, ""If I talk, they'll kill me."""
You're nothing more than a killing machine.
"Long ago, you killed the Sun named Moon, and the Ruin began."
The world is already dead.
I know nothing.
Not even myself.
I only know that my enemies cry out the name Casshern.
Let's stop asking ourselves why the tears keep flowing
"As soon as the sky is filled with blue at daybreak, let's go ahead and row towards tomorrow"
"You can't get by on kindness alone, so you hurt someone"
"You can't get by naked to the world, so you hold someone"
Nobody knows the reason why
Why do we experience love if it hurts so?
Nobody knows the place to go
"We seek each other so fervently, because nothing goes on forever"
"There, robots who have accepted death reside."
"Ne't time: ""A World Replete with Death Throes."""
"This country, our country."
Rising country.
This is country's rising politician.
This is rising talent.
"This is rising gangster, Laxminarayan One."
Who's the king of Mumbai?
He's a Gangster-son.
"Gangster-son, What is it?"
Like Star-son.
"Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan Sanjay Dutt, Abhishek Bachchan."
You're the Abhishek Bachchan of gangster community.
Your father Pappu MMS.
He was Amitabh Bachchan of the gangster community.
Today his Refugee is releasing.
Meaning 1st murder.
We have been fighting side by side forthree years.
Should I feel pityfor some criminal scum?
"-To make a long story short, do you have such people?"
- Surely.
-How many?
- 11 people.
Eleven.
I take all ofthem.
"- No, there is no wayto take all 11."
"- Captain, I hate repeating my requests."
"Sergei Pavlovich, you do not have the slightest idea who they are."
"Two deserters, three military criminals... who started a drunk fight and gave a beating to the duty officer."
There is one rapist and a maraudeer.
These two have capital punishment sentences.
So go and tell them that their Motherland gives them their last chance... to wash their shane offwith their blood.
That's all.
Filfil this order.
-May I ask you a question?
- Come on.
is lieutenant Malyutin guilty of anything?
Why should he be?
Otherwise you wouldn't be sending him out on such a mission.
I do not have any information on that man.
It is very good that you do not.
And do you have any information on me?
Answer quickly!
"You have gone huts, accountant..."
Get outa here!
You'll rememberthis day!
"That's how it is, brother."
-Do you understand the assignment?
"-Yes, sir."
So you're accusing us of corporate espionage and murder.
That's absurd.
John Cutler was gunned down in a secluded cabin managed by your company.
You gonna tell me that was a coincidence?
Yes.
If that's what actually happened.
"What do you mean, ""if it happened""?"
I was there.
I saw it happen.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a murder at one of our properties, so... you must be mistaken."
There's been no mistake.
You guys killed Cutler and then you covered it up.
Show me some proof.
(door buzzes)
Well... ask and you shall receive.
BENNER:
What's this?
CHIN:
That's a lab report.
"See, we just matched up the tire tracks found at the scene to a van registered to your company."
How's that for proof?
STEVE:
So why don't you tell me what happened with Cutler.
Did he up his price and it piss you off?
Maybe you thought he'd been compromised.
What happened?
What happened?
!
(sighs)
"Yes, Cutler was spying for us."
"Yes, we scrubbed the crime scene."
"But we didn't kill him, come on."
Right.
You pointed the finger at Cole.
You led everyone up the garden path.
"Meanwhile, we've got two coppers murdered."
I'm not saying another word without a solicitor.
"Fine, we'll continue this conversation at AC-12 under caution, a date to be appointed by us."
Thank you.
Sir.
You have to shut this down.
I will not let anyone put you on the spot about Cole.
We both know why.
Shut this down now.
You know the secrets I can spill.
"Why don't you come into AC-12 with your solicitor, you tell us you heard the Caddy rumour about Cole off some old lag, dead or lost his marbles, and you leave me to do the rest?"
And?
There's always an and.
And... you turn over all the stuff you've got on me.
End of.
End of?
"The incriminating item I've got on you, that's my only insurance."
You need me to shut this down.
I'm small fry.
You're the big fish.
So what'll happen when they find out about all that evidence you've been sitting on?
Hm?
The contacts in that phone.
The call history.
"All in my past, mind."
"Now, that isn't something anyone could shut down."
"Now, you're what?"
Six months off retiring?
Four and a half.
You think I killed that boy?
That question will never come up between us.
Why not?
It's going to come up in court.
When do I go to trial?
They're bringing in a judge and swearing in a jury right now.
I'd like to set up a time we could get together... and maybe make a preparation or two.
What for?
What are we going to talk about... if we don't talk about whether I killed that kid or not?
"Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom alone for a minute."
You ever see so many bars in your life?
I guess that's why they call it a jail.
"- I've been free all my life, John."
- I know that.
"Look, it's damn important you don't try to break out of here."
"I know you can do it, but it's just admitting your guilt if you try."
"Christ, I can see those hills over there, but I can't touch them."
Cowboys.
Schoolteachers.
You sure are good company.
"Yes, but do you care for me?"
That horse over there... is the only thing I've owned for a long time.
He thinks the whole world of me... and I've never even given him a name.
Was he good company?
Yeah.
- Do you care for him?
"- Yes, I do."
"Tom, you're an idiot."
"Yeah, I know."
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.
How'd you do that?
And they collectively almost so restful.
"After some days Tót family it was learned, that it is possible to doze off at the chandler while he measures the soda out."
During watering in Cipriáni family's shady-cool garden.
While the boiling soup does not get cold.
While the coffee does not boil over.
Or during review in the fire engine house
If the engineer of the aggregator does not wake up the man.
- Lajos.
Lajos.
Lajos!
- What is it?
Is there fire?
- No.
- What do you want?
"Arrange it Lajos, how I shall be allowed to speak the with major lord."
"You know, from my younger brother's thing."
Who because of anti-state rummaging in front of a military court claim?
They accused it of it.
Respectable major lord.
- Where did he serve?
-At car artillerymen.
- 629/12 please.
- His rating?
Corporal.
"You know him, Tót?"
I know him.
Good Hungarian man?
Good Hungarian man.
Why he bring out and why fluttered at the time of a command annunciation the red flag?
Because...he was have a cold.
I report...he was have a cold.
"He wanted to take out his handkerchief, they accused it of it subsequently."
"Who alibied out, by the way..."
The last two knives went missing.
"Well, Lanie discovered there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons."
All we have to do...
"Oh, whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
"T-there is no ""we."" You two are done."
"And if I catch either of you working this case,"
I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
"No, no, no, no."
Mm.
"Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?"
Go home.
Excuse me.
"T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle."
Oh.
Um... thanks.
Looks like Menendez isn't the only one unhappy about last night.
Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.
Good luck.
What's that?
This is payback.
Thanks for coming in.
Where is everyone else?
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.
"It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member."
- It was her fault.
- It was his fault.
"No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes."
"Mr. Wood, please."
Give me another chance.
"No, give me another chance."
"He was in his car like, ""That negro's crazy."
"Something is wrong."""
"Telling you, man."
"Fucking gangster women, man, I like you."
"You freak--oh, my God."
So much power in a woman.
You know where you can find it exactly though?
Legs.
I'm a leg man.
Any other leg men in here?
So what the rest of y'all?
Titty fuckers?
"I'm a leg--there's nothing sexier than a woman with a nice pair of legs, you know what I'm saying?"
Just walking out just nice and just...
Put some thigh-high stockings on.
"Oh, my God!"
That shit is sexy.
"Women, if you don't got a pair of thigh-high stockings, go get some, make your man hot like instant grits."
I'm so serious.
"Matter of fact, if you don't got some right now,"
"I want you to go home, order it from Victoria Secret, and send me the picture."
"Make sure it ain't Snapchat, 'cause I'll get pissed off."
That's all I'm saying.
"But stockings, boy, it's so sexy."
"But women, let me talk to you, okay?"
If you got a fat leg... please do not take a fishnet stocking and put it on the fat leg.
"Now you got little fat pieces popping out the fishnet, and it look like Bubble Wrap."
"Now, me being the type of person I am,"
I'm trying to pop this shit.
"""What the hell?"""
Jump on it.
That shit--
I've been traipsing across this bridge for days now.
Seems I have a long way to go still.
I should be on my way.
Excuse me.
- What do you expect me to do?
- Just stand aside.
And risk falling over the side for a perfect stranger?
Away and bow your head.
You stand aside!
My destination lies at the opposite end of the bridge.
And you'll get there after you back up and I reach that end of the bridge first.
That would waste too much time and time is what I don't have.
So you think you're better than me because you're in a hurry.
"Well, I'm in a hurry too!"
"But, no, you did not think of that, did you?"
That I might be an equal.
No!
"You just consider yourself superior, right off."
You're rude.
"You mistake my comment, sir."
Do I?
You think I'm dumb too?
"No, I..."
"Look, we are both in a hurry."
So I shall hang from these planks and you may walk over.
So you get a peek up my kilt?
That is not what I am suggesting.
"- So you say, you plucky-faced hing-oot!"
- What did you call me?
"So you're deaf too, you clagtail cuddle dreik!"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll fight for it to the finish.
The part at the window that was my audition scene and I had freaked out.
It's scary.
"When you worked on a lot, that's when people are like, ""It's good."""
Then you do it and you're like...
"It's so great, though."
"It's such a sweet, sweet scene."
And I like what's going on with Jonny and Raf in the background there.
- I didn't see it.
- It's very sweet.
They're just kind of canoodling.
"That broccoli she just put in her mouth was saturated with, like, lard oil."
"- Oh, man."
- We were trying to...
"She was trying to pick the healthiest thing to eat off of there, but..."
"Yeah, it was pretty gross."
I feel bad.
Norah never had an orgasm.
I love that whole...
I love that whole shtick.
Norah never had an orgasm.
"See, look at this, I mean..."
We filmed about three minutes of them canoodling.
It was very sweet.
"I couldn't say ""cut"" because it was kind of adorable."
This is really cute too.
Was that a real couple?
- It's a couple of extras.
- A couple of extras.
They're good then.
I felt...
I felt really nervous doing this bit about orgasms.
"Didn't the guy there say something about getting, like, a pocket rocket?"
- Why?
- Because I say so.
"- Anything you say, my dear."
I don't understand why you want to go on leading this unhappy life.
I was perfectly happy until you came.
You're pretending again.
I know very well you're fond of me.
You're just fighting to cover it up.
It must be wonderful to be gifted with so much insight.
"Well, it's very nice, but will you promise to send back those plans?"
They'll be in government hands by tomorrow morning.
There.
I knew you were a woman of intelligence the moment I set eyes on you.
Sort of a like recognizing like.
Thank you.
"Now, please excuse me."
I really have some things to attend to.
- Can't I stay here and help—
"- No, no."
Thank you.
Really.
- Will you have dinner with me tonight?
"- Yes, of course I will."
"But, now, please, excuse me and—"
- Thank you.
- You really are a bit of a darling.
- That's nice of you to say so.
- I'm not bad myself.
"As a matter of fact, I'm considered pretty crisp, in a manly sort of way."
- You'll probably find that out when we get better acquainted.
- No doubt.
Good-bye.
Guinevere.
Heloise.
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic?
To die for love?
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities...
"""Is love a fancy or a feeling?"
"No, it is immortal as immaculate truth."""
"""'Tis not a blossom shed when youth drops from life's stem."""
"""It grows without water, nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom."""
A pity Edward has no passion for reading.
You asked him to read.
then you made him nervous.
Your behaviour is cordial.
You like him in spite of his reading.
I think him everything that is amiable and worthy.
Praise.
Indeed.
He shall have my devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?
"I'm sure you will be very happy, but promise you won't live far away."
- There is no question of...
- Do you love him?
I do not deny that I think very highly of him.
That I greatly esteem him.
I like him.
Esteem?
Like?
Use these words again and I shall leave the room!
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Are Claire and Alex natural?
"He wants me, Mother!"
I'm sure he wants you.
He wants you to cook and clean for him!
- He found you through an ad.
"- I already know, Mom."
Sorry.
"It's not your average proposal, but let's face it."
They're not standing in line for me.
And we like each other!
Then say yes!
I can live alone.
"If you think such a marriage is normal, then go ahead."
Why do you do that?
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.
Can't I have some of that?
"I'm getting older, too."
Why can't you be happy for me?
"But you can't, can you?"
You're scared to death of being alone.
And you're jealous.
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man.
How ridiculous!
"Well, you know something, Mom?"
A man does.
"Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan have exchanged rings and agreed to recognize each other as equals."
They shall seek a life of kindness and understanding.
The ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home.
"And as you have exchanged vows before witnesses, by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife."
It's completely isolated.
"He can beat, torture, or burn somebody, and nobody would hear it."
I never thought the FBI would be here for our fine city's tradition.
I'm Al Garner with the DFD.
Agents Morgan and Prentiss.
"I guess Devil's Night keeps you pretty busy, huh?"
Not as much as it did in the '80s.
"Used to get up to 600, 700 fires back then."
- In three days?
- Down to 115 last year.
It still takes everything we got.
"Fortunately, we've had some help."
Have the police increased their patrols in the Rivertown district?
"I wish they could, but the city's reeling from budget cuts."
No.
Detroit's Finest is a community group with over a thousand volunteers.
[Door opens]
[Prentiss] A thousand volunteers?
"[Morgan] Well, that just added another thousand names to Garcia's list."
- Do you think he's one of them?
- Can't rule anyone out.
What is this place?
It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
Medieval.
"And from the Industrial Age, when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs than anyplace else in the world."
This is where we found Tony's charred remains.
"Well, the char pattern tracks back to here."
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
It's not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
"Yeah, except he didn't want that."
And you won't get thirsty either.
"Oh, good."
That way I can slosh my way through my twilight years.
[Gurgling]
Bob?
I hope I went peacefully
"Sorry, Emily."
I didn't know you were awake.
Bob?
What are you doing?
"Oh, I... couldn't go to sleep, sol thought I'd weigh myself."
"- Well, how much did you lose?"
- I'm afraid I'm like the stock market.
I'm up an eighth.
"Emily, this diet isn't working."
"Well, Bob, you've gotta give it a chance."
You've only been on it five hours.
"Emily, I gai-I gained an eighth of a pound in five hours."
"Well, that's all the water you've been drinking."
I can't understand it.
"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
How could she fly off the bed like that?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated motor performance.
For example say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground.
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.
"Same principle, I mean."
So what's wrong with her?
We still think that the temporal lobe--
What else do you want from me?
Five minutes.
So you've been what?
Stalking me?
I just wanted to see you.
"If I wanted the best vanilla shakes, I would have gone down the street, right?"
I'm sorry...
"Look, you should know that I didn't want to put you through that test."
Ok?
"It's my family's lawyers, they insisted on it."
"I don't want your money, ok?"
I want your signature on a piece of paper.
"As soon I saw you, I knew there was no need for a DNA test."
You're my daughter.
"I know this is really, really confusing."
Ok?
"Believe me, I get it."
"But you need to understand that before I was served those papers,"
- I had no idea you even existed.
- No.
"My dad, Donald, he told me that you left after you found out Mom was pregnant."
No.
"I never should have left your mom, that's the worst thing I've ever done in my life."
But I swear I did not know she was pregnant.
I loved your mom a lot.
I brought you this.
Just read it when you have the time.
Are you going to sign the papers?
As soon as my attorneys say it's ok.
I gotta get back to work.
"Hey, just wanted to let you know we found a body near that halfway house."
"No ID yet, but it could be the woman you're looking for."
hey were slightly anarchic.
And that was their appeal.
Today is our last day in the UK  for a while you know e're going straight into the ak e Me Home tour for 1 0 months.
U.S.A!
U.S.A!
he first time  it was literally just the UK that we were playing out to.
"Whereas now, it's all around the world."
hen we started getting ready for it we just knew that it had to be good.
think we felt lik e we had a lot to prove.
he fans have spread the word about One Direction so much that I think it might be a little bit different this time.
e never expected any of that so now there's something to live up to.
"And if we don't live up to it, then I don't know what happens next."
You hear about bands who've-- hey've come and they've gone.
don't wanna be one of those.
""" Madison Square Garden."
"The world's most famous arena."""
Now that sums it up.
"I just don't know where it goes from here, really."
It's mad.
I'm really nervous.
"Me too, bro."
"Proper nervous, Iike."
So crazy.
Madison Square Garden.
No way did you ever think that you would be coming to Madison Square Garden...
-...to see them perform.
-No.
Here we are hours before we head off to see our babies.
Yeah.

"Fat, wait for me in the car."
The good old ear test.
"How are you doing, son?"
"My fingers, my eyes can deceive me... but never my ears."
The fabrics speak to me.
I can't hear a thing.
I know.
That's why I didn't insist that you follow in my footsteps.
The fabrics tell you what type of clothes they want to be.
You'll never forgive me for not being able to listen to the fabrics.
Who am I to forgive anyone?
I don't defend universal truths.
I defend my own truths... but look where it's gotten me.
It's made you an extremely elegant old man.
What good is elegance... in these days of jeans and T-shirt?
Women don't look for elegance anymore.
They only look for money.
"Four wives... my mother in the '50s, yours in the '60s... another one in the '7 0s... and he ended up in trouble with this one in the '90s."
If Veronica ends up with this shop...
This place is my life.
"- We're going to win, right?"
- Yes.
What do you want?
No rush.
It's just that...
High quality.
It would make a nice suit if it weren't for the color.
"But Dad, my idea was to make a Campari-colored suit."
"If the cloth cries out to be a suit, it can make a nice suit... even if it was born Campari."
Excuse me.
May I help you?
"In English, please."
Mumbai suited me well.
If we look at the history of the Indian film industry..
..then we come to know that in every..
"..different generations, different.."
..actors have been superstars.
"The first generation was of DiIip sir, afterthat came.."
"..Rajendra, Dharmendra, Jeetendra.."
"..Amitabh Bachchan, and today.."
..Krishna is very popular amongst everyone.
hello.
"Mr. Krishna, firstly Id like to ask you that you have.."
..become a superstar in very less time.
How do you feel after attaining so much success?
The truth is that all this seems to be..
"..like a magic for me, Tabbassum."
"Ok, Mr. Krishna, it is said that behind.."
"..every successful man, there is someone."
Today you are shining like a star in the sky of prosperity.
Can I know who the one behind all this is?
"There are many people, but my sir is the most important one."
Sir!
"Mr. Krishna, our audience would.."
..definitely like to know..
"I would Iike to tell everyone, Tabbassum."
Sir.
This is the name I worship before worshipping God.
Because God gives and then takes it back..
..but my sir hasjust given me.
"Today, even though I am away from him.."
..but because of his blessings..
..today thousands of people and watching my show.
Even my sir might be watching this show.
With super-human courage that defies anything else he's done before he fights his way up out of the pit while the man-eating crocodiles gnash their teeth in rage at the escape of their victim.
"- Gee, crocodiles."
"Oh, boy."
- He'll get away from them like he did from those man-eating sharks.
Bet I could if I was Speed Foster.
- ready to strike.
Kadonka kill white devils.
Speed laughs at him in scorn and roars:
"Throw that spear at me and you die, Kadonka."
"Kadonka, he big warrior."
Hold poison...
"All right, lay one down there, boy."
I sure hope Frank gets to be foreman.
Hah.
"Boy, how we'll stall on him."
Or maybe you guys are too dumb to know how to stall.
"I guess everybody around here's pretty dumb, except you."
"That's telling him, Eddie, old boy."
That's telling him.
Ha-ha.
Frank will do all right on the job.
He's got lot of good practical experience in this shop.
"Every time I say anything, you always wanna start an argument."
- What is it?
- Don't be discouraged.
Keep trying.
Maybe someday you'll say something that makes sense.
"Hey, Joe, come here."
I need you.
"Sure, Tommy."
Anything wrong?
Nothing Dombrowski can't fix.
"Once inside, I could direct the flow of electrons through the wires hidden in the walls."
I was able to find my way to Amanda's room.
"Finally, I got my message through."
"And finally, we would have our chance to talk."
Phase Three.
MEET ME AT THE RACK ALARM CODE 12154
You owe me... big.
"Trager, you really embraced your inner Hallmark card."
You've gone soft.
I know.
You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
All this for puppy love?
"I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?"
"I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set Kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced."
"God, that felt good."
Did you see where I put the napkins?
Is there a garlic convention in here?
Too much?
Never.
What's the occasion?
Take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
Um...
I'm incredibly hungry.
How about all of the above?
Stephen.
Hmm?
You mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
Moriarty's mechanical dragon attacks a speeding locomotive... and they steal a parrot that belongs to one of the passengers.
"Meanwhile, Holmes finds out that there's a relationship... between the parrot and Indian merchant who's gone missing."
What will the parrot tell us?
"If you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at Baker Street."
Game of Wits!
Parrot vs Professor
"Ladies and gentlemen, did you hear?"
"Get them, please, get off the plane."
Mrs. Dexter...
"Look, look, she's just had two very long flights."
If you would be patient-
"It's all right, Dex."
They're just doing their job.
King Galen will be coming off the plane any minute.
Could you please stand back and give a little room?
"How is he, Mrs. Dexter?"
And where's Prince Michael?
- Prince Michael is on the plane with His Majesty.
"Now, he's unconscious and he's still very sick."
- How did you get him out of Moldavia?
Did you pay the government?
We issued a press release when we changed planes in New York.
You should have that information within the hour.
"- Look, here they come."
Please stand back.
Clear the way.
Please stand back.
Alexis told me once when we were married:
"""Blake, there is nothing on this planet that I can't do, including the impossible."""
"I guess she proved that to the world, hasn't she?"
Darling.
After five years it can be everywhere.
"Why did they wait so long until they sent us, anyway?"
Procrastination is like masturbation:
At first it feels good  but in the end you just catch yourself.
"I've got all the data out, Commander!"
"I'm a backup person, nasty killer machine!"
"I do not need no hand, to kill a Noid."
Because you've never seen one of those things take the man's arm.
You said it!
"If so my kill rate goes high, I like that."
I know the reports on AI systems.
The majority of patients are 10 years after implantation.
"So you have no problem, you're wrong."
"Sorry for all the shit about the death of your wife, sir."
"Between us, this mission is not about Noids."
Is personal.
We are his devilish dogs...
And we come back healthy!
"Hey Bishop, what are you doing?"
Shaving your legs?
If we do not have more energy and your blaster has become shiny black cock
What do you do then?
Then I put the bastard in the ass!
"I caught something warm, behind the snow."
"Okay, Kix."
- Warm the gun!
- Your best idea so far!
Kix waits for my signal.
"- You're the boss, Commander!"
- Go to your last team!
I thought this noid could fly.
"Hatta, do not continue."
Can you hear me?
"Hello?"""
I've just killed two people.
My aunt and my uncle.
My name's John Mercer. sync:baozi
The Fixer S01E01
How did I become a hitman for the state?
It all began five years into my life sentence and the day Lenny Douglas came to take me out of prison.
I killed my aunt and uncle because they'd hurt somebody that I love.
Maybe that was what got Lenny's attention.
He liked emotions.
They...gave him something to manipulate.
"So, while the rest watch The Champions League, you stop trying to push down the walls."
You pick up your book...
..and you worry about the mystery of things.
Lenny offered me a new life.
A new home and a new family.
But there was a price.
There was the job that he wanted me to do.
Lenny Douglas ran a secret team in the war on organised crime.
I never knew who gave him his orders.
But somebody at the highest level had approved our existence.
Lenny's first trick was to reunite me with an old acquaintance.
"Now, how can I describe him?"
Take the person who annoys you the most and multiply it by ten.
You think you've left them behind.
You think you'll never have to see their face or hear their idiot voice again.
That's Calum.
Yeah!
Hey!
First time I heard this tune I was in a club in San Antonio with these two mental birds Niamh and Catherine.
"Cousins from Burnley, mate."
"Oh, I don't know, Nate."
We can't just leave her in the grizzled hands of a predator.
"- Well, we can't take her either."
- Why not?
Because that would be abducting her.
"I know, but she's just a child, Nate."
"Mm-hmm, and that's called child abduction, which is a crime, unlike what they're doing."
So you're just gonna side with him?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do!
"You think you're saving her from beautiful life as wife of rich doctor, followed by even better life as widow of rich doctor with no heirs?"
"Well, there has to be more to marriage than money."
- You think she gold digger?
"- No, I think you gold digger."
Look at you with your bracelets and that ring.
That ring.
I need you to tell me what he said.
I want you to leave now.
"Please, Mr Lee!"
I'm his mother!
Get out!
You coward!
"Mrs McCarthy, what a lovely hat."
It makes you look like royalty.
If only!
Mrs McCarthy... have you heard of a new restaurant in Cheltenham called
Gerard's Brasserie?
I was wondering if you'd care to join me there tomorrow lunchtime.
"Well, I have a WI meeting."
The speaker runs a cattery in Painswick.
"Well, surely the WI can do without you for one day."
"No, I don't think I will."
"Then I think I'd better be going, too."
Since my being here is useless.
"You don't mind, do you?"
"I must say, what a letdown."
"Really, all that trouble for nothing."
"It's your fault, sending a telegram like that."
That's enough!
Don't you blame Tateo.
I made him write that.
But...
I don't see what is wrong about writing the truth.
Stupid!
"They did drop the atom bomb, and they resent being reminded of it?"
"If they don't like it, they don't have to remember it."
But I can't have them pretending ignorance.
They claim they dropped the flash to stop war.
It's already been 45 years now.
But the flash hasn't stopped war.
They're still killing people!
But you know... war is to blame.
People do anything... just to win a war.
"Sooner or later, it will be the ruin of all of us."
"Now, let's go to the arrival lobby."
There's still time before he comes out.
But...
I feel sort of depressed.
If he came here because of what my mother said...
I don't want to meet Clark.
Shall we run away?
I feel really awkward about introducing Clark to Grandma.
So do I. But it can't be helped.
Don't you think what we are doing might not be the right thing to do to Clark?
- I just gotta put out a fire for a client.
- Can we talk about that later?
- This is more important.
- Wayne:
"I thought you were gonna tell me it was something important, like a testicular cancer scare."
"No, not that important, but still nonetheless, it's important."
More important than bringing your team to Vegas?
"I only stuck around for this lunch, Spencer."
I'm heading back to LV today.
Jet is washed and the Joe's Stones are on ice.
"- Vern, what's up?"
Wish I had better news.
"- Wayne, yeah, I understand."
"I get it, it's only a onetime pass."
"- Yeah, it happened again."
- It's not gonna happen again.
"Yeah, he's more than a little upset, Vernon."
"- Wayne, hold on one second."
- He's cutting you.
Cutting me or cut me?
What tense did he use?
"What the fuck does it matter what tense he used, Vernon?"
- Jesus Christ.
Come on.
- You didn't listen.
"What the fuck are we gonna do, Joe?"
Me and Spencer are heading there now.
We are gonna beg for mercy.
"You are gonna fucking divest yourself of the entire weed business ASAP, you hear me?"
"First off, calm the fuck down when you talk to us, man."
We ain't done nothing that wasn't in accordance with Colorado state law.
"- Reggie, please stop talking."
"And then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud."
He'll draw every light from every goon tower.
It's our only chance to cut through.
"What do you say, barracks chief?"
"He's right, Hoffy."
It's either Price or Dunbar.
"He killed Johnson and Manfredi, didn't he?"
It's all yours.
"What's the matter, Price?"
"You said you were gonna save Dunbar, didn't you?"
So now you're getting your chance.
"So long, Cookie."
"You can have the department store, what's left of it."
"So long, Sefton."
"You're not disposing of those Russian broads, are you?"
Tell you what to do.
Get yourself 100 cigarettes for the Kraut guards.
Then get yourself another face.
- You could use a new one too.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Let's synchronize the watches.
It's 11:42 sharp.
Check.
Just one more word.
If I ever run into any of you bums on a street corner just let's pretend we never met before.
Shut off the moaning or you'll have the machine guns on us.
"Shut it off, lieutenant."
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly one minute and 20 seconds.
- Sefton.
"-What'd you expect, a St. Bernard dog?"
- Not you.
Why don't you tell her about Tulsa?
- Max...
"- No, tell her, Sal."
- She needs to know.
- What?
What happened in Tulsa?
"It was almost ten years ago, I guess."
We'd just started working for the Doctor.
"It was a... a long game... a real-estate scam... and about the hottest summer you can imagine, so I went to the movies a lot."
"And this guy was... sitting a few seats from me one night, and he offered me some Junior Mints."
His name was Martin.
And he was... just about the sweetest guy I ever met.
We just seem to fit.
"You know, sometimes you get a taste of real life, and it seems pretty all right."
"You start daydreaming, you know... about getting out for good."
So what happened?
"Well, let's just say the Doctor sent me a message... a little reminder that anybody not in the life, not like us, is a liability."
"And if you care about those people, you know... you have to be careful."
"And sweet Max... was there to put me back together, weren't you, Maxie?"
"Anything for you, Sal."
You know that.
"All right, I get it."
But this guy at the coffee shop... he's a nobody.
You don't have to worry.
"Really, I'm on it."
Want something?
Yeah.
"I'll have a Manhattan, please."
Keep the change.
I need a little favor.
You know what?
Put it on our tab.
I'll be right back.
John.
It's disarmed.
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?
"He didn't make it, sir."
I need to address the nation.
"General, get on with the Joint Chiefs."
We need to move our troops into the Middle East to stabilize the region.
You wanna move troops in?
When they find out that we almost launched a nuclear attack..
there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Yeah.
When did you and Walker cook this whole thing up?
Excuse me?
How'd it go?
You gave Walker the launch codes and he made you president?
You can prove this?
"Well, Walker had to get the launch codes from somewhere.."
and you were the only person with those codes.
And I found this pager in Walker's pocket.
I only know one other person that uses one of these.
That doesn't prove anything.
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?
"Why don't you call the return number on that, Carol?"
Would have been better if the evidence had been destroyed..
in the air strike that you ordered.
"You're a goddamn traitor, sir."
"But this is thievery of the educated, done for easy money"
"Mrs Batra, I might report him to the police."
But I haven't the heart
But he will never gain admission into any university.
That's his punishment
He will never find employment in any computer company
His future...
I'm very sorry.
But Why did he steal?
Whatever the reason might've been only Jagadish can tell
You have betrayed my faith in you!
"Not you, all of us bear the punishment"
How much money did you make out of selling papers?
Even you think I'd do such a thing?
I was just helping a friend
"At least you'd understand that, I learnt it only from you"
Learnt from me?
What?
Thieving?
What am I?
A thief?
Helping friends!
Is this how you help friends?
By robbing?
"You haven't a degree, you have no future."
You're ruined
You are a thief!
I am a thief's brother.
And that's the truth
You will achieve nothing in life
"Jai was my weakness, you were my strength"
"But today, you make me weak."
He--he's near the top of the list.
"UNOS will find him his organs, when they find him his organs."
And God knows that staying up all night chatting about it is not gonna help.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.
I suggest you do the same.
He's running out of time.
They always are.
Welcome to peds.
Of all of the tools on a surgical tray...
Sound judgment is the trickiest one to master.
"And without it, we're all just toddlers running around with 10-blades."
"Oh, I asked them not to wake you."
"I said, ""Whatever it is, it can wait till morning""."
"""Dr. Shepherd needs his beauty sleep""."
Your latest head CT shows that the brain contusions are expanding.
I'm gonna get you into the OR right away.
This--this brain thing.
It--it could kill me?
"If we don't treat it, yes."
You find that funny?
I'm sorry.
It's just that they're gonna execute me in five days.
Five days.
"Might as well take my chances with this brain thing, right?"
- Mr. Dunn--
"- You gotta admit, it's a nice way to go."
Plenty of attractive females.
All the jell-o I could want.
Have you tried the strawberry?
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?
"Either way, I'm going to die, dr."
"The mathematical world is completely rational, uncomplicated by sex."
"You think too much, hon."
Don't you want to know how big my tits are?
No!
I just want to share my life with someone.
- Someone I'm not sexually attracted to.
- What?
"How can two people come together for what's a lasting and substantial, mutual respect, genuine affection, in a world that's run by ad agencies selling great sex?"
"Take out your own ad, I guess."
- An ad?
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me.
I'm a grown woman wearing a prom dress.
You are not.
You look adorable.
Adorable?
I look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll.
"It doesn't fit right, it's too tight."
Too many Sno Balls.
Why didn't you pick out something looser in my color?
Because maids of honor don't wear black.
It would help if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
- Why don't you wear some make-up?
- I am wearing make-up.
Let's go.
And your hair looks good today.
"I like it, the curls work."
Why don't you get a perm?
I tried that once.
I looked like Shirley Temple on crack.
Where the hell is she?
I'm gonna kill her!
Soon-shin...
I'm sorry to cause you concern once again.
Don't be silly.
We heard everything from outside.
I can' let you go alone.
I will round up the members of Deung-ryong and we will go together.
No!
"What do you mean, Master?"
Why are you stoping us?
"If we send him alone, there is no telling what they might do."
That's a cross Soon-shin alone must bear.
"I cannot obey you, Master."
I refuse to let him go alone!
Are you going to turn Deung-ryong institute into a martyrs' den?
Master...
"Kyun, Master is right."
Soon-shin!
What are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?
You wish to make a deal?
That's right.
"If I don't return by 7:00 pm, your journal will be turned over to the Court of Equity."
Fool.
How are you going to prove that journal is mine.
You can't bring me down that easily.
"No, I can't prove anything."
"Even if I could, I'm sure your connections in the Courts of Equity will make that proof disappear."
If you now that why would be so foolish?
But if copies of that journal are delivered to Attendant Ju and Prime
"Minister Yoon, what then?"
"Along with a note saying that the original has been delivered to the Court of Equity as well, of course."
What?
I don't want any teacher making a fairy tale out of life.
It's hard enough without being unequipped to meet it.
That's a good rule.
Shall we sit down?
And rule two teach a minimum of facts and maximum of ideas.
"Our main job is to teach children how to think, not just to memorize."
If war comes for us these kids shouldn't fight just for historical dates but for the ideals behind them.
"I like your rules, Mr. Rossi."
Peyton Place is very fortunate.
"Thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"Allison, I don't know what Betty's buying, but tell her to hurry."
Okay.
"Mother, Ms. Thornton didn't get the job."
I know.
Betty and Margie told me.
They're in the back.
"After giving her the gift and the speech, it was embarrassing for her."
She'll get over it.
I'm glad I'm graduating.
I don't want to know the new principal.
"- Mrs. MacKenzie, about graduation... ."
"- What about it, sweetie?"
Mother needs a new dress for the exercises.
Could I make some arrangement to buy her one?
After I graduate I'll get a job and I could pay you back.
You'll be needing a new dress yourself.
I can get by.
"Look, with Easter and graduation coming on, I'll be needing some help."
Would you like to work afternoons and Saturdays?
- I'd love to!
- Fine.
- Then I could buy two dresses.
Kozlenko's require a Class A security clearance.
"And in 1988 there were only two people, other than the operatives themselves with that kind of clearance on that specific project."
"One of them Yale, is dead."
"Oh god, what the hell is this?"
You are the one that set up agent Kozlenko.
You told the Stazi about the defection.
And you helped set the trap that killed him.
You have no proof.
"Actually sir, I do, the money."
The ten million dollars marked for Kozlenko.
Once a year the bank needs a signature to renew the account.
I checked it out.
"It was your signature, sir."
The only thing
I can't figure out is whether Jared Clayton was working for you.
Or you were working for him?
"I knew you were ambitious, Henry."
I just didn't know how ambitious.
"Security is on its way up to you, sir."
You might want to call your lawyer.
I'm not going to be calling anybody.
"Sir, you were saying?"
Sounds good.
I'll release the statement in the morning.
"You should get some sleep, agent Davis."
You sound tired.
It's been a long week.
"Yeah, yeah, I"
- I can hear him.
"Uh, yapping in the background."
Is he house broken yet?
"Mm, sorta."
"Ho, ho!"
Poverty has got to go!

"Like just last night What happened, man?"
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart
And now he's doin' life in prison at the age of 21
"Livin' on death row ""cause he couldn""t let go"
Caught in the web of violence
Row deep when they creep
And move in silence of the lambs

It's the temporary bamboo bridge that the savages used in the past
"It's ugly and insecure, but they keep walking over it"
I'll tear it down sooner or later
But it saves them lots of time if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field
Look!
This wire bridge is strong and firm
Tado?
This young man is Tado Mouna the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
But he saw us without saying anything
Is there anything wrong with him?
"No, it's a habit of the savages"
It's not a very good habit
"Oh well, they're savages after all"
Can you stop talking about them like that?
- Sugiura!
"- Welcome, sirs"
This is Officer Sugiura
This way please
"You should've informed me before you came here, sir"
I could've asked those savages to welcome you with dances
Us becoming friends.
Kai...
"I came back here to have a normal life, not to screw up yours."
"No, you came back to undo a regret."
At first.
And then I realized that I can do a lot more than that.
I can rewrite my whole existence.
"No, you can't."
"I can, and I was, until you showed up."
"You know, getting in the middle, between you and Ethan, that was the old me, and I won't go down that road again."
And I'm not asking you to.
"We shoulda stuck to coffee and small talk, like I said."
I think that you're overreacting.
Really?
Yeah.
You think you can just say that... that you feel something for me and it doesn't change anything?
"Well, not if we don't let it."
Just do yourself a favor and stay away from me.
Kai...
I'm serious.
I'm done--
"With this whole screwed up situation, this friendship... or whatever the hell it is."
It's over.
"Relationships-- they feel so permanent, so solid."
"So why, are we always surprised to find out that, like everything else, they are not immune to change?"

Let's go!
Come on.!
"He's lookin'great, huh?"
I don't know.
Did he seem a trifle tense to you?
"Higgins, let's go.!"
"Well, just take all day, Higgy baby."
"Maybe beauty knows no pain, but I knew I did."
I figured the only way I could get through the day was to put my body on automatic pilot... and concentrate on something else.
The trouble was all I could think about was Roger.
"If Gold Teeth was right, he wasn't in a hell of a lot of trouble... not with the feds anyway."
"He'd stolen money, but he'd stolen it from a thief."
"If Roger turned it in before the statute of limitations on the crime ran out next week, he'd probably get a reward."
Hurry up.
They're due here any minute.
"All right, all right."
Which brought me to Barbara.
Why didn't he meet her at the airport?
"Did he have cold feet about marrying her, or... couldn't he show up because he knew someone was following her?"
"But if he knew, why didn't he just take the money and run?"
Call her in a couple of weeks from Tahiti or wherever?
Now remember the drill.
"T.C., you towel him dry, Right."
Get him into the running shorts.
Running shorts.
"Okay, Rick, shoes and socks."
Shoes and socks.
And don't forget the foot powder.
Foot powder.
I myself have exactly...
four ounces of glucose.
I'll get it.
Several possible explanations come...
How can you explain a massacre like that?
"No, Mr. Spock, the threat is clear and immediate."
Invasion.
"Very well, then."
"If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base."
I intend to.
"If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us."
- Captain to helmsman.
"- Sulu here, sir."
- Is the alien still making warp 5?
"- Affirmative, sir."
- Initiate warp 6.
"- Affirmative, sir."
Overtake.
Phaser banks.
Lock on to the enemy vessel.
Stand by for firing orders.
"All hands, this is the captain."
We are going into battle.
"All hands, battle stations."
Red alert.
"I repeat, red alert."
This is no drill.
This is no drill.
"Captain's log, stardate 3046.2."
We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus III.
- Mr. DePaul?
"- Yes, sir."
Position.
"Twenty-two-point-three parsecs beyond latest chart limit, sir."
All scanners lock into computer banks.
- You're all right.
"Somebody's going to snap you up, wait and see."
You saw what happened in Boise.
What happened?
Didn't you see all the guys in the diner breaking their necks to look you over?
- I didn't see that.
- Sure.
How often does a girl like you come into a place like that anyway?
"Now, you see, in the morning we'll take the old elevator down... and we'll be on our way."
I wish it could have been you.
It would have been better.
You go to sleep.
I think you should go back.
Back where?
He wasn't even sure where he was.
- What if it was them?
- He wasn't sure.
You did the right thing.
Let the National Guard go look.
- It's what they're there for.
"- Ladies, would you mind holding it down?"
I'm trying to think.
- What if it was my brother that was down?
"- Now, quit!"
I don't even want to think about that.
- Edgar'd go after him.
- You don't know that for sure.
I think he would.
"You marry a mail-plane pilot, see how anxious you are to send him off in one."
"When the time comes, we all have to take care of each other."
Nobody else will.
You'd hold your breath every time he left and wouldn't let it out until he'd come home.
"Got to keep drawing their fire, all right?"
Got it.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.
All right.
I got your back.
All right.
Cover him!
"Rob, why eliminate witnesses?"
"I mean,whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?"
"I mean, the bombs have fingerprints,don't they?"
Something that make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
"It has, uh..."
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device where it was made.
"So there were dozens of these things used in the attacks,right?"
And now you have the last one.
Yeah.
"Robert, I don't, I don't think these people are looking at this thing as a weapon."
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun behind the greatest crime in the history of the world.
Huh.
The bomb... it could expose the people who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Yeah.
Did you see what I just did?
I just need you to help me look pretty enough to capture a nobleman.
No problem.
This is gonna be harder than writing the book.
The Earl of Cleveland is going to be here any second.
I hope you memorized the names of the dignitaries.
"Oh, don't worry."
I made a cheat sheet.
"- Oh, no."
- What?
These are my football picks.
"Elka, what were you thinking?"
I know.
Ravens plus three?
Here they come.
"- Oh, I'm screwed."
- Don't panic.
The Earl has to introduce his people to you.
Just pay attention and repeat what he says.
"Councilwoman Ostrovsky, a pleasure."
The members of my party:
"Chief magistrate Martin Portreeve, lieutenant colonel Rodson Heathcote-Drummond, the honorable Martin Gled-heweson, bishop of Lichfield, lord keeper of the privy seal Lemonde Oswolf-sticket."
"Everyone, please welcome the Earl of Cleveland."
"And with him plaidsy, war man, churchie, and..."
Lemony snicket.
I believe we're going to have great fun doing business together.
"Gentlemen, please."
"You did it, Elka."
You're a hero.
"Oh, save it for the real heroes, the ravens, if they cover the spread."
"Oh, you look so beautiful."
Your eye patch matches your gown.
"Your gown covers the wheels on your orthopedic boot, and the super glue is holding perfectly on your dead tooth."
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCA detective, also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
The kids found the bodies - I saw it on the news.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad.
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
"After that, he wrapped this tape around her face."
Suffocated her.
Must've taken a while.
"The man that organised it is called Jacob Gould, a real high-flyer."
But I think he had help from the inside.
- From who?
- Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
So you're part of this Operation Merlin as well?
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"- Who do you work for, then?"
"- Oh, now there's a question."
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post-traumatic stress.
- Yeah.
Unofficially?
- I don't think that's any of your concern.
- My job's to disorganise crime.
- Illegally.
"- I prefer to use the world ""irregular""."
"- Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
I'm pitiful
"I'm sorry, I was too mean"
There's no need to appologize
Otaku hunted at this age...
"I guess it was an old man hunt, not an Otaku hunt"
Or maybe it's both
Being an adult must be tough
"From a social standpoint, you're totally an adult, too"
We aren't gonna charge into Miyu's house today
Why?
I'm tired
"Coming from the countryside, the overnight bus was pretty tiresome"
That makes sense
"Yeah, so we will head directly to the hotel"
How do we get to Higashi-Ginza from here?
"Big Sis, we can't do that"
Why?
Cause we don't have money
Big Sis?
You took a pic?
Gonna send it to little sis
Why?
Cause I owe her money
I need to send pics periodically or the interest goes way up
You sold your soul
"Give me, I'll take a pic of you"
"Oh, your zipper is open"
Big Sis...
"And, send..."
"Oh, cruel ""Tiro Finale"""
"My little sis's reply will send me down the ""Law of Cycles"""
I'm not a big fan of Magical Girl
I already did.
How about i call you big cutie?
"Like, big cutie, have some more treats."
- Thank you.
"- Hey, tom."
Sheila brought us rice crispy treats.
The guys are giving me a little fire fighter tutorial.
Damian wants to drive the rig when he gets on the job.
"Why don't you graduate first before you start picking out a goddamn locker, ok, punk."
"Come on, tommy, he's gonna graduate."
"Yeah, his instructor says that he's already top of the class so far."
"What are you, 3 weeks in?"
Stretching hose and doing physical training.
Got some guy that used to look up to your old man helping you put on your bunker gear every day.
"Wait till they stick your narrow ass in the smokehouse, ok, or you're roasting at 1,500 degrees in the goddamn flashover stimulator."
Then we'll see how big your balls are.
"Hey, asshole."
"I'm sorry, big cutie."
"Listen, why don't you back off my son."
"Because this ain't goddamn summer camp, ok, sweetie."
"And if I'm not mistaken, chief, isn't there a rule against social calls in the firehouse?"
"Don't be a stickler, tommy."
"Here, have a treat."
No thanks.
"Ok, duty calls."
"- Hey, can I ride along?"
- No.
"Oh, come on, chief, let the kid ride."
It'll be good for him.
- Only if his mother says it's ok.
"- Uh, it's ok."
"You stay clear of the action, ok?"
"It says here, ""Thomas Anthony Ballantine..."
"""is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain..."
"""and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."""
Try and keep me out of this.
"I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both."
"Wait a minute, Mac."
Wait right here.
I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
"- Darling, I have to go."
I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
"After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?"
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
"I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else."
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand.
I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You?
I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
"If anything happens to you, I'd be in a fine mess."
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
"What are you looking at, say thank you, and give the payment."
"Son, tell me one thing."
Is there any good corner in this hotel?
Why?
Because you payment is very big.
"If i will give it here, everyone will see it."
"Yeah, there is a corner, let me show you, come... why are you beating me Bhai?"
"Hit him... if you don't want to give the payment, forget it, but why you are beating me i am cheep, and i will wear this?"
Tell me where is the diamond?
Here's your diamond.
The diamond which was snitch from me and took my honor.
Honor can be destroy by snitching this too.
Diamond which shines...
Bhai see this how shiny is this.
The diamond which was stolen by Yadave.
Now who is Yadav Bhai?
"Yadav, that's Yadav."
I have come to shoot him Bhai.
Now what is he?
"He stole you diamond, Diamond was stolen by Yadev."
Then you did you send his photo.
"Not his, i have send you his photo in the envelope."
Then why this photo came out.
"You are lying... you are lying, you have send this photo."
"And that diamond photo too, and after this you are beating me too."
You didn't got his photo?
"No, otherwise i would never spear him."
I even beaten him too.
"When, where?"
He was running from the street.
So where he is right now?
"But the one who he was following, is in the same hotel."
"I'll join you in a moment, babe."
Sit down.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know better than to talk in front of her.
The price of beef is going up too fast in New York.
They feel a congressional investigation is imminent.
"So, what do they want from me?"
A four cent drop for the next six months.
[Laughing]
"Six months, huh?"
Do you know how much that'll cost me?
"Hey, you seem like a smart, young man."
"You tell me, what am I paying' those guys down there for, anyway, huh?"
Can't they do something about it?
They are doing something about it.
They're giving you a warning that could save us a lot of aggravation.
You can't afford to be too greedy.
It's not like the old days.
"All right, all right, all right."
Work it out!
But don't you give me no crap about the old days.
"At least, in the old days, you could understand the comics."
"Today, all they got is cosmic ducks and star shit."
"Now, you get outta here."
Don't you come back until you have something I wanna hear.
"Okay, Mr. pontivini."
Whatever you say.
"- Hi, tom."
"- Hey, Ralph."
"Very good, thank you, very good."
"Listen, Ralph, uh..."
"I'm lookin' for the girls that were with those, uh, ghetto ghouls on the night they were killed."
"That's enough, dastard!"
Get out.
Get out
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Get out!
"Take it, son!"
Come on.
"- Whatever I had, was 3 boats sunken - to the bottom of the sea."
"Hereafler they are not allowing wound, brickbat, it's incurable."
"Hanieh, Bashirou,"
You!
So you have loaded all of your things.
"My burden sank to the bottom of the sea, Zaer_"
These things I brought are imposing on you.
"- Then, what are you going to do?"
- The truth is that I came here to how can I tell you?
I came here to be the seaman of your boat.
"No, it's not possible."
What are you talking about?
As I do remember all your family members were chief or captain.
I am beholden to you and your father so much.
"Captain Zaer,"
- how many times I told you these Tangaki people
"- They are innocent, Zaer_"
I am wondering what a compassionate man you are.
"It's outside and inside of the house as you see, captain."
"If Bashirou's mommy can clean it up, it will become a wonderful place, you can even arrange a wedding party here!"
"Let me kiss your hand, Zaer_ Oh, captain, what are you doing?"
What are you saying?
"If anything is lacking ask the estate agent for it,"
He has wit.
Do you know why you cross your arms?
Feels like you're talking to two people right now.
"Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense."
You're protecting your vital organs.
Do you feel threatened by me?
"Well, I don't, but the other guy might."
He is hilarious.
Enough psychology for now.
"What do you know about feminism, Wayne?"
I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist.
- Why?
- Someone will start shouting'.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities.
"So, are you a feminist, Wayne?"
"Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man."
"- But 'cept this one, I guess."
- Excuse me?
"Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table."
"(SIGHING) What do you want, Wayne?"
"- I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely."
- Not what I'm asking.
What's a Gus'n Bru?
Ooh!
I'll Google it and find out.
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.
But we don't have any.
"So, what can I get you to drink?"
I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a...
"Six cod and chips, six haddock and chips, threepenn'orth of spare chips and a dozen pickled onions."
Come to six and threepence.
"Here's the change, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Thank you, Henry."
Did you get any crispy bits?
"Yeah, I got those for nothing cos it was such a big order."
"Cor, what a lovely smell."
Did you put salt and vinegar on?
"No, I didn't think it would be to his lordship's taste."
"You put them in the warming oven, James, I can't stand the smell."
"Am I to understand it's fancy dress tonight, sir?"
No.
We want to put the workers at their ease.
"I see, sir."
"Pour me one, George."
What on earth have you done to yourself?
Perhaps the cap is too much.
You look absurd.
What do you mean?
"There was a man digging up the road, he was dressed exactly like this."
"So I made a list, gave it to my tailor, and he sent them round."
"For God's sake, take that awful red hankie off."
Put it back on again.
- What are you doing in that get-up?
"- It was you father's idea,"
- so as not to embarrass the guests.
"- You are a silly arse,"
I simply said we won't dress for dinner.
We just looked out the window and saw three men looking at their watches.
"I don't want to worry you, but they were all wearing dinner jackets."
- (Bell)
"- Oh, my God!"
I trusted you with mary's life.
"Not just her survival,"
"Though I hear you threatened that, too."
"I gave up every moment of being a mother to my own child,"
Based on your word
That you would raise her to be francis's wife.
"What did you think, when you traded a child"
For the protection of France?
That we would put her welfare above ours?
Lord knows you didn't.
You gave her away to secure your rule.
"I had an infant,"
"A girl, not even a week old when my husband died,"
And she was crowned queen.
I met unexpected horrors and tragedy
And I faced them with courage.
You...
One charlatan scared you by whispering in your ear
About your son's death...
A future no one could know...
And you changed the course of nations.
Nostradamus's accuracy is an inarguable feat.
Here's a feat:
"Women like you and me, surviving in this age."
"I have sold my soul, and my child,"
To protect myself and my nation.
Mary may be scotland's queen
But I am its king.
Has scotland noticed that its king
Has rather overexposed breasts?
It is beginning to.
Ah.
I've got to find some way to make money.
Why doesn't he just retire and let me run the business?
There's not a chance of that.
The business is his whole life and he's still in his prime.
Except for his absent-mindedness about appointments.
"You know,"
I think you've got something.
What do you mean?
The old boy is losing his grip.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
"When you can't remember business matters, it's time to retire."
John's got a memory like a file cabinet.
He never forgot anything in his life.
"Ellen thinks he forgot about my appointment, doesn't she?"
You know very well you never had an appointment.
I know it.
But does John?
Don't you get it?
He prides himself on his memory.
"If we can convince him that he is getting forgetful, then we'll be able to..."
"Oh, no!"
He'd be a nervous wreck in no time.
"Oh, what a horrible thought."
It was only an idea.
I think it's a wonderful horrible idea.
Something I can do?
Something you should've done three weeks ago.
Why haven't the contracts been sent to the Craddock people?
Just waiting for you to sign them.
What are you talking about?
I signed them a month ago.
"I'm sorry, John."
- You're well informed.
- He's bound to sail here to safety.
"Here, he won't be trapped or cut from his bases and supplies by the enemy fleet."
- Admiral Jarvis is no fool.
- He'd be happy to hear you say so.
He would have done as I said.
Our responsibility is to carry out existing orders.
We're responsible for the ship.
"To risk it for orders, instead of using imagination..."
"When you get your own ship, you can sail by imagination."
My ship will follow orders from the Admiralty.
Whatever the consequences?
You may have power over life and death of everyone on this ship.
"- I warn you, if we come through this..."
- Yes?
Lf?
To have followed Admiralty orders may not be enough.
I will say this once.
"I'll not be bullied, and I intend to be obeyed."
Your friends mean nothing to me.
"While you serve this ship, they'll mean nothing to you."
You can go now.
- Steady as she goes!
"- Steady, sir."
"Mr. Ponsonby, set t'gallants."
"Smartly, Ponsonby."
"Aye, aye, sir."
Topmen aloft!
- Set t'gallants!
- I can.
Get them down.
This isn't a nursery.
Months ago.
"Look, I'm in love with Adrian."
All right?
"She doesn't want to think about getting married right now, but I want to marry her."
"She met my mother last Sunday, after church."
What?
"All right, then, we should disperse."
Get going.
(CLEARING THROAT)
I can't believe this.
Amy is married and
Adrian is semi-engaged or something and I'm not even allowed to date.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous times call for ridiculous measures.
Like?
Like staying home and studying and focusing on getting into college.
Getting an education prepares you for life.
Getting an education helps you think.
Thinking is a skill in itself.
"Look, say what you want about school, but life is all about does the boy get the girl?"
Does the girl get the boy?
Or does the boy get the boy?
Or does the girl get the girl?
"Or any of that, all of that!"
"I understand what you're saying, but let me put it another way."
Every relationship is a school.
Every person you meet is a teacher.
"If you don't like learning things in school, you're probably going to have a few problems learning from people."
"Now, that's ridiculous."

"Sorry, the reaper?"

"You know, if you're looking for a new friend, how about Lance Crawford?"
He's such a nice boy.
"Mom, Lance Crawford and I hate each other."
You're just obsessed with getting his mother's peach cobbler recipe.
"Well, what kind of a woman keeps a recipe a secret?"
"If that recipe were the polio vaccine, we'd all be in wheelchairs!"
I don't like Lance Crawford.
He's always staring at me in this really creepy way.
"And this one time, I saw him fiddling around in my locker."
"When I opened it, there was a rose inside, and my gym socks were missing."
"Donna, a little advice."
You're not gonna want those socks back.
I can't think of anyone new I wanna hang out with.
All the girls I know are either too snobby or too slutty.
"Yeah, I'm not good with the snobs, but slutty's my bread and butter."
"You know, what we need are people with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman."
He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.
- Sold it last week.
- That punk.
He's out.
"Hey, Carrie Gerber has a trampoline."
"Carrie Gerber also has a big, hairy mole."

"Mom, if it's another one of Dad's Marine Corps recruiters, I'm gonna run away."
Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
-What for?
I got pinched.
"-Everybody gets pinched, but you did it right."
-You told them nothin' and they got nothin'.
-l thought you'd be mad.
"I'm not mad, I'm proud of you."
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
What?
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
Oh ho...
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
"By the time I grew up, there was 30 billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport, and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it."
"See, ya gotta understand, we grew up near the airport."
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place... and they would tip us off about what was coming in and what was moving out.
If any of the truckers or airlines gave us any trouble Paulie had his union people scare them with a strike.
It was beautiful.
It was an even bigger money maker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.
"Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport."
"To us, it was better than Citibank."
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy and me.

And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.

It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just oId-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
Bittu would have died and the other kid would have gone to jail.
This is the same thing that'll happen to Boss and Shiv.
I don't understand.
Boss will kill Shiv and will be executed for that.
But boss is our man!
I don't even trust my father.
"This an old habit of mine - first clear the garbage, then clear the record."
Why are you outside?
From today your outgoing and the phone's incoming are both out.
Go into your room and shut the door
And you can watch t.v
Untill I call you out...marriage must take place
Now go?
Ayushman boss arrive
Were is your boss?
My work is to release water.
Boss so much of power Your plant grew
This is what you call Power plant
So you are Ayushman Takur?
Arrange a meeting in the 5-star lobby.
Sir how can I assist you?
Will you kill Shiv in jail?
What are you saying Takur?
I know your story.
You clear garbage and then clean your record.
If I kill him in your jail won't you be investigated or not?
The media already has footage of you and that boy.
Why provoke more attention?
So what can we do boss
Kill Shiv not in jail but outside.
Superb!
"What do you say, Ayushman?"
"Well, I guess I destroyed the mosque before we even built it."
Most of the people here probably won't even remember this.
"You know, that's... sad that that's as reassuring as it is."
"Amaar, sorry, I'm late."
What did I miss?
"You're so pretty, Rayyan."

Can't let this get you down.
- How would you suggest I...
- Motivate it?
"Look, if we don't raise the money, we are not getting the mosque."
"And if last night is any indication, we are not raising the money."
- Do you need a bottle?
- A bottle?
"Yeah, 'cause you're acting like a baby."
"So, last night tanked, suck it up!"
You wanted a sign?
You were given one that told you to build a mosque!
You might have to do some of the heavy lifting yourself.
"- I'm sorry, was that too harsh?"
- No.
You're right.
You're absolutely right!
I can do this.
Positive attitude makes all the difference.
What if the chicken wasn't a sign?
What if I missed the real sign while I was hanging out...
- With a chicken?
- You want another sign?
Really?
That's kind of creepy.
[ amused exclamation ]
"And I was like, ""It's cool, really."
"You can call me Sheer for short if you can't get it."""
"And she looks at me and she goes,"
"""Can I just call you Jane?"""
"And I was like,"
"""If you want to give me a slave name."""
[applause]
You can't do that.
Just change someone's name for the convenience.
"Is this ""Roots""?"
Are you trying to Toby me right now?
"And every time that happens,"
"I want to get so sassy and be like,"
"""Oh, I'm sorry my name's too ethnic for you."
"""Sorry you can't fit all that heritage in your little lips."""
[cheers and applause]
"But I don't really have a right to be angry in that regard, because my name's not actually from any island or African culture."
"It's from ""Star Trek."""
My parents are Trekkies.
Technically Trekkers.
That's what the fans were called when the show first came out.
And they were watching an episode together--
"Season 2, Episode 50-- and Captain Kirk was flirting with this alien princess, as he does."
"And he gave her a rose, and she goes,"
"""Oh, we have something like this on my planet, except it's made out of crystal and it's called Sasheer."""
"And my parents were like, ""Yes!"
"That'll be our daughter."""
And they gave each other a Vulcan high five and called it a night.
Then why were you out in it the night before last?
I wasn't.
"I was here all night, Mum."
I'm ok.
"No, seriously, dude."
When did you learn?
I started taking lessons a while ago.
This and voice.
Voice?
"Yeah, you know, like singing lessons."
"Dude, if you tell any of the guys at the house, I swear to god, I'll kick your ass."
"Nah, your secret's safe with me."
- So sing something.
"- I don't know, dude."
"I never, like, really sang in front of anybody except my vocal coach and, like, my band."
You got a band?
"Yeah, yeah, a couple of N.Y.U.Music grad students i picked up."
"So if you got a band, you're probably pretty good by now, right?"
"Yeah, listen, you know, like sean's sleeping in the other room and he's got the flu and stuff."
"Oh, come on.See, now you're just making excuses."
"I mean, how are you going to sing to a stadium full of people if you can't even sing to me in this room?"
I guess you're right.
"I mean, there is this one tune I've kind of been working pretty hard on, like, that I wrote."
"Ok, so sing it."
"- All right, but my chord progression's--"
- Blah blah blah.
- Just get on with the freakin' thing.
"- All right, all right."
I'll--I'll do like a verse or something.
"* Nothing left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality cannot take what lies ahead, * * clear the path of destination is what you once... *"
What?
That was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, you know,"
Do you know how many nights I've stood on that bridge?
"How many times I've... climbed over and stood on the parapet and... wanted to jump, wanted to end it all?"
You want the truth?
The truth is...
I'm a coward.
I'm fucking scared.
I need your help.
I need you to be there for me.
The only way I can do this is if you help me.
You said we were friends.
Mm?
Then help me to do this.
"Please, Paul."
"As my friend, all right?"

Believed to be a native Frenchman...
MydearestFrances  I know you're angry and hurt.
You don't want to hear anything I have to say.
I don't want you to feel bad for not speaking to me.
I don't blame you at all.
"And, of course, you're right."
I don't expect you to understand why I've done the things I've done.
I don't even understand them meself... though me pals Arthur Guinness and Jack Daniels might have an idea.
Anyway...
I need you to know it was never my intention to hurt you.
"I've been stupid, and selfish, and pig - headed."
I don't have much to show for me time...
except you.
And I couldn't ask for more.
Look after your mother.
You don't need me to tell you she's one of life's good ones.
Far too good for someone like me.
"Shut down, always trying to be the tough guy."
Do you know how many times I cried in a helmet?
I'm fine.
Your engagement broke off last week.
Now you're sleeping on the couch of a guy whose middle name you probably don't even know.
Patrick.
"Fine, we're best friends."
But you can't tell me you're not hurting right now.
"Look, honestly, I don't know how I'm feeling, okay?"
"There's a lot of things going on in my mind right now, and I just need to sort some things out."
"We will, I promise you."
Two nights on my couch and I will get inside of you.
Feel like we got off to a weird start.
It's so nice out.
I know.
"Walking outside, in the fresh air..."
We should get a treadmill.
"You know, it's so weird that lily and Neal actually broke up."
"I know, it's a classic story."
"Couple falls in love, decides to get engaged, disaster and heartbreak follow."
What kind of fairy tales were you read as a kid?
"My favorite one was called ""eviction notice,"""
where the princess had to move to a new castle.
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.
Did your dad ever hug you?
"Aw, come here."
"Mm, not like that."
"Well, I can think of some other things your dad never did to you."
"- Okay, first of all, ew."
- Mm.
"Second of all, ew."
It says Robert Quinn?
"Until there is signed consent from Robert Quinn, the adoption of Callie Jacob is denied."
Told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt.
Your bones are shattered in several places.
- He's gonna need surgery.
- He's a pianist.
Our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all.
- What are you doing up?
- Can't sleep.
You?
I remember when you used to crawl into bed with me when that happened.
"Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, spare you tonight."
Hm.
"Then you'd end up sprawled out sideways, your feet next to my head, kicking me in the face all night long."
"See, I remember it as you headbutting my feet, actually."
Really?
Then Mama would viciously attack your elbows with her ribs?
Really?
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Sounds terrible.
Eh... it was pretty nice.
Back when that was all it took to make you feel safe.
- How's it feel?
- About the same.
Still numb?
"What if I, um  can't ever play again  like I used to?"
"Honey, don't think like that."
"You can't think like that, ok?"
"You just have to keep trying, keep at it, you know?"
"Don't you ever give up on your dream, you hear me?"
- We don't have any oranges?
All right.
Will it be fine if I just give it to you?
Then we have a deal.
A contract?
Didn't you say that you will definitely pay me back?
No need to look to know that you still want to be a driver.
Why don't you just be my driver?
I'm not that familiar with South Korea.
You can also help me run errands.
I'll pay you 25 000 Won to be my driver and also to run errands.
Two hundred times should be enough for a total of five million Won.
Two hundred times?
You don't want to?
Then don't repay me.
Why so urgent?
Where do I need to sign?
It won't be easy.
"Even if it's going to be tiring, I will not give up."

(Dark horse - is a term used to describe a little-known person.)
I heard that you also got an invitation from United States.
Why did you choose to come to South Korea instead?
Money?
My father has earned a lot.
He will definitely let me inherit it.
So I don't feel the need to serve the United States.
"So, you are a patriot."
"Mr. President, being under your service is a big honor, and it can't be compared to any other thing."
- Before that.

Have you started the classes?
Is she learning our language?
We are studying my Paşa.
But she's not that keen
You'll learn our language quickly
How much did you pay for me?
We have got lots of golds.
I'll give you as much as you want
Just let me go
I understand your anger.
But think twice before talking
Because
You are neither talking to a merchant nor a pirate
Were you ever captured?
I'm grieving
I'm miserable
I don't know what to do or what to think
Nobody treats me bad here
But I treat everyone badly
Anything I want is done.
"Dish, drinks"
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm a prisoner
I request you to release me
I realised it is not happening.
But at least let me walk in the yard
"I want to breathe, walk and ride a horse"
Don't tell me you couldn't manage it
Did you find it?
I told you I would bring it
Did anyone see you?
I took it when everyone was in the yard
Let's go back to the hospital.
"Since things went wrong at the hospital, this is a medical mistake."
"If we go to the hospital and talk to them, they'll switch you back."
What are you going to say?
Ah...
"This man is my fiance, but his body got switched with that guy."
So take responsibility and switch them back.
That's what you're going to say?
Fine.
"I'm sure I'll be told that I'm crazy, but they'll find a way to fix it."
That's right.
"We're going to be told we're crazy, and all 3 of us will get locked up."
"You, me and my body that's in the hospital are going to keep staying at the hospital."
"If you're going to go, go by yourself."
I don't like hospitals.
"Just because you don't like it, you think avoiding it is the best?"
-Don't act like a kid!
-I'm still a kid!
-I'm 18 years old!
-That's right.
And a kid needs to listen to the adult.
"-Let's go, Kang Gyung Joon."
-Don't treat me like a kid.
This face isn't a kid's face.
Are you trying to joke with me right now?
And you shouldn't act like a frustrating adult and try to push me!
Why can't you think to calmly listen about what happened from the one affected?
Fine.
Talk.

"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
"No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world."
Ten thousand dollars.
"Ten thousand, cash to you."
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
"What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?"
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"Yeah. ""Morally outraged, "" he said."
Threatened to call the police.
"- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?"
- Like the Exxon Valdez.
"So, what do we do about it?"
"Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
"That, and the fact that she speaks English."
- You didn't have to do this.
"- But it's teatime, and I wanted to..."
"Oh, no."
"Beatrice, I told you to doily-line the plates."
You don't have to doily-line the plates.
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.
"- Rory, you're already here."
- You're out of breath.
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.
Your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us.
That certainly justifies a run.
"All right, everybody, sit."
"Pour the tea, Beatrice."
"Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on... pouring the tea for just a minute?"
Thank you very much.
"Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you."
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.
But I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.
We won't get upset.
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.
And you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.
She's been hanging around you far too much.
"Rory, we accept your terms."
Please proceed.
Thank you.
"First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know I'm here."
"She'd probably be mad if she knew that I was, but I feel this is important."
You have beautiful legs.
Thank you.
"I'm a bit too tall, aren't I?"
"No, you're perfect."
You look great.
"No, I'm too tall."
I wish I could cut them short.
"Come on, don't do that."
"Director Kim, guess you got to work on your script now."
I guess so.
What is it about this time?
I only have the title.
"""About Miracles."""
Does it sound too scholarly?
"""About Miracles,"" I see."
"- ""About Miracles."""
- Miracle?
What kind of miracle?
A man travels to a foreign beach and stays at a hotel.
And in his room he plays Mozart on his CD player.
Then he leaves his room and hears the same music on the lift.
"He walks out of the hotel, then takes a turn at the corner, and on the street is a clown."
He's doing his mime to the exact same music.
It's an incredible coincidence.
But this man doesn't think it's a mere coincidence.
He wonders why he heard the same music three times.
"And he concludes that if he can find the reason why this happened, he can unravel a secret to the world."
And he's obsessed with that thought.
So he starts tracking hints.
For ten years.
"First, he begins with info about the clown, the women he met, his preferences, everything."
Down to the speaker's brand in the hotel elevator.
"In ten years, you'll be a forty year old ahjussi."
"At that point, today will appear like a faded, yellowed old photograph."
"Without even knowing it, you'll realize you've already let go."
"After that, the days will continue to build on top of each other, and you'll be like a fossil from the dinosaur age to me."
Too depressing?
"This is Lee Seo Yeon, I wasn't able to reach the quota."
"No matter how hard I tried to lengthen it, I just couldn't do anymore."
Did you send the manuscript?
I'm calling because I've been waiting.
"I sent it, you didn't receive it?"
"No, I didn't."
Where did it go off to?
Emails lately have been arriving hours later than usual.
I sent it last night around ten or eleven.
"Anyway, I definitely sent it."
It's hard to believe an email you sent last night still hasn't arrived.
"Anyway, please send it again."
"All right, I just got home, I'll send it right away."
"All right, thank you."
Yes.
I sent it.
"I sent it, I definitely sent it."
I sent it.
Welcome!
I decided to make curry today.
It's going to be amazing.
What's wrong?
What?
Be quiet.
Did you lose something you've been working on?
I said be quiet!
Why are you getting angry?

Huh.
"Oh, my God, you don't even know what are animals and what aren't."
"Okay, can we please just focus on the fact that in that moment we just made a pretty good team?"
"Well, yeah, I don't know, I didn't do much."
"Well, that's what a team is."
"You're not supposed to have the same strengths, you know."
You're supposed to trade off.
"Like, with the squirrel, I was strong, and with the mugger, you basically hung out with him and played Wii."
"You know, I'd like to see how brave you'd be if the little squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked you for your wallet."
"If the squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked for my wallet, we would be millionaires."
"Okay, in a hundred-meter sprint,"
I am beating you every time.
"In high school my nickname was ""fast Whitney."""
"Look, I'm sure that's true, but I'm talking about physical speed, all right?"
I'm pretty sure that I'm faster than you.
"Okay, you do a lot of things fast, but running is not one of them."
"All right, look, we're not having this discussion right now, all right?"
"Men are faster than women, end of story, good night."
- Really?
- Really.

"Since the separation, not even divorced, mind you."
Running around with lounge lizards like that Mr. de Mario.
"He was the one that took her out last night, before she was killed."
Listen... do you think that de Mario did it?
Who knows?
Gives me the creeps.
"He's the slippery type, you know."
"Well, why not him?"
"Listen, he brings her home, see."
They've been drinking maybe.
Then she asks him to drive you home to get rid of him.
"But he fools her, he comes back."
"Did act kind of peculiar in the car, coming home."
"Never opened his mouth once, except to say good night."
"That was kind of funny, wasn't it?"
Yeah.
"Well, as I say, anybody could've done it."
They say when they found her strangled--
I don't even wanna think about that.
She was never any good.
"Even right from the beginning, when I first started sitting for the Nashes."
Long before they were separated.
(Lottie) I remember one night.
They were supposed to go to his boss's house for dinner.
So I got there at 7.:00 like I was supposed to.
Mrs. Nash was picking on Mr. Nash something awful.
It wasn't as if I was snooping or anything.
"She must've known I was standing there, but that didn't stop her."
Not for one minute.
How much longer?
"30 minutes, 45 tops."
I have the money.
"All right, but if you're not at the 7th street train station in 45 minutes, I'm contacting bin-khalid's men."
"No, Ben, listen..."
What's that?
"The subroutine search we were running, using Mullins' override to find the leak."
There's a hit on whoever accessed
The army rangers' identities.
They used the CTU director's code.
Keith?
Yours.
How is that possible?
Can you see where the file was accessed from?
Yeah.
A computer in your husband's campaign headquarters.
"Uh, the IP address is scrambled, but let me see if I can..."
Got it.
"The computer the rangers' identities were accessed from belongs to Mizrani, first name Nilaa."
My husband's campaign manager.
We were pulled offline.
I can't get back on the server.
They know.
They cut our out-feed.
I'm not looping the evidence room feed anymore.
"Carter, we're shut down."
You need to get out of there now.
"Keith, we're running an operation."
If you shut us...
You're not running anything.
Nothing happens till I confirm what the hell is going on.
- Lock them in interrogation now.
Do you have no pride?
"You're like a cheap whore who'll do whatever her man wants, you know that?"
What about the honeymoon?
Did the director say anything?
"Come on, cooperate with me."
That man was mine since I was sixteen.
That can't be.
Have you been here before?
Have you been here?
I just passed by it on the way to a company workshop.
I'm really a bastard.
"Ever since that day, I think about having you half the day, every day."
I think that's all that's occupying my thoughts.
"Sometimes I wonder, how can I be less of a bastard and still hold you in my arms?"
"I was always like, ""What should I do?"" ""Can I make a move first?"""
But I was afraid that I would be embarassed.
Aren't you taking too much meds?
Why are you taking meds so often?
It hurts.
Is something bothering you that I don't know about?
There's no such thing.
-Why does it hurt so often then?
- I don't know.
Maybe something's growing inside.
Don't even say that!
It just comes too often.
-Could it be really brain tumor?
-Stop saying that and go to a hospital.
It will stop.
"Sis, did you go out?"
I thought you said you weren't going out.
Of course.

We're losing our hunting grounds and you still keep the hounds to look down on you?

Not only do you befriend us with wine but you speak our language fluently
Hey!

You've worked all day long for such a mean wage and you waste it on wine?

"Yeah, right!"
You're an incredible mom to that bunny.
I guess I have changed.
You've evolved.
"And over the last 950 days we've been dating... and, yes, I've counted, and yes, I counted the Zach era, because, really, who were we kidding?"

"Thanks, Cohen."
What's wrong?
I met GEORGE.
I'll kill him.
This guy came by from GEORGE to recruit me.
He heard about my work with the sea otters and invited me to travel across the country and talk to college kids about voting next November.
What about Brown?
"I'd have to defer a year, live on a bus."
Sounds like a great gig.
I don't know that we could see each other.
So you have to choose between me and GEORGE.
That's the thing-- I don't know that I have to.
"I do believe that you are my destiny, I do, Seth."
But I just don't know that you're my only destiny.
Here.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Mm-hmm.
I picked couples through time.
"Oh, and where are we?"
I was hoping that someday we could go in the middle.
So can I tell you what Bullit's surprise is?
I can't hold it any longer.
Sure.
His plane is sitting on the tarmac gassed up and ready to take you anywhere in the world.
"Mom, you're going to be spending Valentine's Day anywhere in the world that you want to go."
"I mean, that's pretty amazing."
I'm not.
You're perfectly justified to hate him.
I'm saying he's really gone back for me.
He's always been a good friend to me.
That's funny 'cause I thought I was your friend.
"Look, our friendship has always been outside the Greek system."
"You always said, you're not gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends."
So let's not lose that.
I see you later.
Hey heavy Poo!
You're here to give the dean his morning foot massage.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen you in the sunlight before noon."
You're getting troubles with the law again?
100 hours of community service.
I consider myself lucky though.
"Could have been a lot worst, I was the only one who got busted."
"And by the way, you're a total dushbag."
Why's that?
Because you raided out our party.
I knew it was someone on the Greek task force
You're the only one I know with personal vendetta.
"Still, pretty low."
even for you.
Now you'll think twice before trying to pouch one of your pledges.
He came to us.
I don't know why I'm bothering explaining myself to you.
Take care.
Bing.
- What did you call me?
- You heard.
"Just to let you know, there will be retribution."
Bring it.
Or i will kill you.
Then you will left crying.
"Go back, stay away... go back..."
"Ma'am i am the same Laxmi Narayan, Ma'am I am not Laxmi Narayan!"
"Ma'am I was telling you, i am not that Laxmi Narayan!"
Inside... i will shout you if say a single word.
"Stop, hold him... teasing girl, even with those guns?"
"And including me also... i was just telling you, that he is the same Laxmi N. Who come to shout you."
"Then why didn't you said, ""that's him"" ""that's him""?"
You told me to shut my mouth.
I think he is scoundrel... i should let you hit by her sandles.
Just like the other day.
"Madam, i am fresh now."
Now show... i have never show it to anyone before.
What?
Never show?
Then how you do business?
Please don't call it Dhanda (business) I sounds very Ganda (bad)
Why is it bad?
"In our business, customer don't pay till they though the item."
And we have to show on words too.
You also show it?
Yeah... and you know my nature and ladies check every thing.
"Weather if its not loose, size is fine... we have to show every thing."
I am doing bussing like that for 40 years.
Show that... this is only for the watching purpose?
But who hit me?
"Don't know, there were two people."
"They hit you, and they were taking you with them."
"Then i stopped them and told them, that's my Laxmi Narayan."
Did you said that?
"Then they talked on the phone, and ran away."
- and I'll never forget...
"- Excuse me, miss?"
Miss?
"- Yes, sir?"
- What's this?
"Three Plantation Dogs, an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,"
"White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams..."
"Okay, you charged us for eight drinks."
There's only five of us.
- Refills are free.
"- Oh, yes, they used to be, but we changed our policy a few years back."
"Well, I wasn't notified."
You should've put that in writing.
"Oh, we did, sir."
"It's on the wall, on the table, and from what I've been told, it's facing you when you use the urinal."
"Well, I didn't come here to read, I came here to eat!"
"Now, take these off of my check, you bunch of chiselers!"
"Oh, oh, oh."
I understand.
"If you're having a difficult time right now, we have an ""indigent can."""
It's near the register.
- I'm no charity case.
"- Oh, of course not, you're a human being."
"But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it."
"Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?"
"Nobody's eating garbage, princess!"
"Now, let me tell you something, lady..."
How dare you insinuate my husband can't pay!
"- Sue, butt out."
- He can pay for this!
- I can?
- Open your wallet.
Even if you shed tears over her.
Because I... am already yours.
Could that have triggered it?
No...
It couldn't be.
I always looked up to you.
You had everything that I did not.
So I hated you.
"Still, do not worry, sister."
"From now on, I will be truly be your substitute and I will be Slaine's support!"
Why...?
What's up with that?
Does that mean she got ditched here?
"""The captain left me in charge because she trusts me."""
"That's what she said, but Cdr."
Mizusaki has got to be devastated.
Why did she pick Lt. Marito of all people as her traveling companion?
Companion?
"Escort, more like."
What's this about Lt. Marito?
"No, um..."
"It's just that he accompanied the captain to the conference, so I thought it might be serious."
Ah.
"With that Martian proclamation and all, the situation is definitely changing."
I can't believe that the princess is getting married...
That's what you're interested in?
"No, but look..."
Isn't it possible that her change of heart was because someone around her felt that way?
"Like, she was seduced by him or something?"
Sorry.
"But we're still not 100% sure that the Princess Asseylum who said that was the princess who spent time with us, right?"
I honestly can't say.
How many kills you have made?
You really didn't know that i am Bhai (brother)
How would i know?
Then why you were waiting for me in the restaurant?
That's my restaurant.
I have been inform that you are coming there so i bought my beg there.
So Bhai(brother) call you and send me to kill you.
What?
Your boss is bhai (brother)?
Yeah... you know it was my first murder.
"For this bounty, mother have paid lot of bounty in Mandir."
She went to Sidhivinayak every Tuesday by walking.
"For ""my son get one change to murder."""
"After that much ganpati, i got one chance."
"I though by one murder, i could steel my life."
"Then i will marry to daughter of Chora Khujli, and make my life."
But... because of me every thing gone wrong.
Kill me.
Laxmi kill me.
"What are you saying, you don't have to worry."
"I am here, from today i will stand before you if any bullet comes to you what?"
You will fight with you boss for me?
Now i will show Bhai(brother) what is Bhaigiri(gangster)
Leaving... your just call wife's ring.
"Not nessescery... i will come back soon, i will wait."
Bhai (brother) you are here?
Open grave and hidden new can be seen from far away.
Work has done?
You were right bhai (brother)
My loose motion has stopped Bhai.
"Here is you stuff, your diamonds."
"See, have you seen Chota Khujli."
"What does Harry have to say this morning, my dear?"
"I said, what does Harry say this morning?"
"Oh, nothing much."
I'll wager my gout hurts him more than it does me.
Does he send any news I can hear?
"Oh, he just says that he walked through the East End recently."
"""I have never seen such deplorable housing conditions."
"Surely the city fathers should find the funds to..."""
"Well, then he just goes on to say about the housing conditions."
They must be pretty dreadful.
He's quite right.
They're disgraceful.
I was saying at the club before I left.
"Now, there's a problem Harry could get his teeth into."
He's just the man to...
"Here, here, my dear."
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested in housing conditions at the moment.
You mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment?
Nonsense.
"A woman must learn to read between the lines, my dear."
"Yes, I like the tone of that letter."
"And what's more, my dear, I think my gout is getting very much better."
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
- Are you here alone?
"Yes, yes."
I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.
"Not me, nor you either."
We ain't got time.
"Get dressed, we're going out."
"All right, people, let's learn something."
"Carter, how do you check for spinal cord injury on an unconscious patient?"
- Look for absence of tendon reflexes.
- Do it.
Poor little thing.
"- Harper, what film do we want first?"
- Chest?
I'll do a cross-table lateral to rule out a C-spine fracture.
Deep tendon reflexes are present bilaterally.
Babinski is normal.
"Harper, let's talk head trauma."
What study should we do?
"- Come on, Harper."
Pay attention.
"- Pressure's falling, 50/30."
What do you hear?
Diminished breath sounds on the right?
I appreciate air movement bilaterally.
No pneumo.
"- No, that's upper airway sounds."
- I see a tracheal shift to the left.
- So do I.
- Tension pneumo.
Good call.
I'll teach you how to do a needle decompression.
"Carter, run the blood up to the lab."
Our new Urgent Care Facility could use someone like you.
- Urgent Care's a smart move.
- Most emergencies are run-of-the-mill stuff.
"Sprained ankles, croup, concussions...."
You'll spend most of your time on ear infections and well-baby checkups.
Private practice is changing.
what is that?
- A really good movie?
- that's a tabloid tv show.
Come on. seriously£¬guys. she can't keep getting away with this.

All these people backbiting and conniving--
Don't you think we should be moving on with our lives?
Well high school's over
But--but they're still my friends. you're still my friend.
Yeah.
What you--you don't think so?
No no i do but honestly...
School's finished
And our parents...
That--that doesn't really look great.
Next year we're gonna be in different cities.
And when you think about it
What's really keeping us together?
So that's it?

Well congratulations dan.

Can any of you declare you would have acted any differently?
I believe the answer is no.
"If ever any man deserved to die, Jonah Catchings was that man."
For all that he imposed on Obediah and his family...
"... doubtlesslyonmany, many others."
And just as surely...
... IbelieveObediahJackson deserves to live.
I believe that...

"I said, ""Your fat ass gonna die, man."""
"Now I used to work in the back, washing the plates, the knives and the forks with my white friend, James."
"Now, there was an old Black dude named Fred, he used to wash the pots and the pans."
Now Chris Rock said it the best about old Black men.
"He said it the best, he said..."
"""Old Black men"
"""are the most racist people in the world."
"""Who the fuck are you?"
"Who the fuck are you?"""
"""Who the fuck are you to talk about..."""
"""They don't even fucking fight you."
"They just shoot you, ahh."""
"So they decided to send rolls to the back, right?"
I thought it'd be funny to pick up a roll and throw it at Fred.
'Cause I like messing with people.
"I picked up the roll, I threw it at Fred."
"It hit him, hit his water."
The water splashed him in his face.
But he thought that James threw the roll.
"Yeah, ""Oh, shit,"" right?"
"So in the back of Golden Corral,"
"I kid you not, he had a civil rights flashback right there."
"And it's like he turned back into a slave as soon as it happened, man."
"He said, ""Woosh!"""
"""Hey, cracker!"
"""You's throw another roll, and I's gonna fuck you up."""
"Now, New York, I had a decision to make."
"But I ain't no punk, I'm a survivor, so I was like,"
"""Yeah, throw another roll, cracker."""

- How?
Compassionate release.
"I had the transplant, but rejected the kidney."
Guess the state didn't want to pay my hospital bill.
- How did you find me?
- NTCC list says you're next in line.
"- For once, the sicker I am, the better."
- How sick?
End stage renal failure.
"And now, heart damage."
So any day now.
As soon as some perfectly healthy person with my blood type is murdered or has a terrible accident.
Kind of hard to pray for.
Waiting's got to be rough.
Better than the alternative.
You ever think of going on the black mart?
You gonna bust me if I say yes?
People say it's wrong to sell a kidney.
"But then, how come they pay everyone else?"
The transplant team.
The NTCC.
The hospitals.
The people who make the rules aren't dying.
Why did you come here?
"Because you have type-A blood, and we find a guy who died after selling his kidney on the black market."
Also type-A.
I don't need his kidney.
I'm at the top of the transplant list.
What do you mean?
You have to pay the remaining six thousand dollars before you can have your license
Six thousand more?
Of course
"Give me back the money, I'm not buying it"
"Well, then all that will cover the administrative costs lf everyone came in like you and messed about, how can we run a business here?"
Country bum
How come you puke just after a short car ride?
Are you alright?
Luckily I haven't bought it
"Otherwise, you can't enjoy it"
Come down
"Hey, you..."
Damn
What happened?
What are you doing?

You want your money back?

And along with some administrative fee
Thank you

When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpsein the living room, if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real estate women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
Who's the owner?
A local contractor and me.
"Uh, I buy and Bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert Whitehead, the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here, you or Bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus."

What?

You got four legs.

"""Don't talk about the baby."
"Not the baby."""
That reminds me of The Wolf of Wall Street.
Y'all seen that movie?
"Now, uh, first off, Margot Robbie, the main chick in that movie, uh, she can get the dick."
"That's my woman crush Wednesday every damn Wednesday, I'm telling--"
"She, ""Mommy doesn't feel like wearing any more panties."""
"And I said, ""I agree with you."
"Yeah, you shouldn't."""
"But the part that that reminded me of in the movie was the part where Mr. Jordan,"
"Leonardo DiCaprio, is in the car with his daughter, and he tries to run."
You know what I mean?
He tries to get out of there.
But he hits the tree.
"And that's not a funny situation, 'cause putting a little kid in that situation, that's not safe."
But what was funny was the caretaker that they had.
You know what I mean?

That she married a student without a stipend?

"Dr. Ogden looked at it, she says it's healing nicely."
It does hurt like the Devil though.

- Something?

Huh?
You've no right to keep her!
"She's my property, and I've a lineup of customers waiting."
"Well, then they'll just have to wait."
But thanks for popping in because we've got some questions we'd like to ask you.
- What were you doing in the woods last night?
- Looking for the girl.
Why else?
You were not looking for her; you were hiding her!
"Now, why would I do that, huh?"
Stop playing the innocent.
"You let her out, tied her up, no doubt waiting for the perfect opportunity to go back, get her, and leave town."
Meanwhile the Constabulary and half the neighbourhood are on a wild goose chase looking for her.
"Enough with the lies, Mr. Travis."
What is going on?
You're right.
I was leaving.
I wanted to get her as far away from this town before you bloodthirsty lot strung her up for something she had nothing to do with.
We have evidence that she attacked the victim.
"- I am innocent of what I am accused of tonight, but there is something else to which I must confess."
"From a young age, this man was not only my trusted physician, but the object of my lust."
He was a friend of my father's and forbidden to me.
"But in my innermost desires,"
I burned for him.
He is here tonight.
"In fact, he is the very man who brought me here to Rosewood."
Torrington... come.
Let us finally admit what has remained silent for so long.
Please... let us be married in sin together.
Come play our little game tonight.
You will be rewarded later.
- This is not the trial!
- Now it is time for you to play your part.
I can't wait to do this to you when we're alone tonight.
I've dreamed of this evening since you were a young girl.
- Isabel.
"- Tonight, the judges shall be judged."
"Dr. Cairn, this blade looks quite real."
"Calm yourself, Doctor."
It's all part of the performance.
"- Tonight, you will all be on trial."

- Run.
You run far away from this place.
"You know, I find that the most amazing creatures have furry behinds."
"Sitting in Woolsey Nicholls ' office, discussing the furry behinds of bees  Chuck realized this was her very first job interview ever."
"She considered this fact for a moment, then had to ask:"
"I have to ask, are you the Woolsey Nicholls from Bzzzzzzzzz!"
Honey and More?
Mm.
"Yes, I am."
Why are you here?
Isn't Betty's Bees your biggest rival?
I own Betty's Bees now.
We made the acquisition very quietly.
"These days, merger can send brand loyalists into a tizzy."
"Well, I'm a honey loyalist, and you'll get no tizzy from me."
I just hope you're not killing Bee-Girls.
- I beg your pardon?
- The Bee-Girl sales division.
"With any acquisition, there's always downsizing and restructuring."
I hope it doesn't affect the Bee-Girls.
The Bee-Girls will always have a home in my hive.
"Unfortunately, although fortunate for you we've recently had an opening in the Bee-Girl division."
"Oh, yeah, I heard about that."
Kentucky Fitz?
Something about a honey-harvesting tragedy?
Yes.
It's very sad.
She had a bright future here at the new Betty's Bees.
Yeah.
I also heard that she was thinking of leaving Betty's Bees before she died.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."

Yes.

Where's Gao Jian?
Didn't see him
"Master, I'll get him!"
Shut up and go!
Gao Jian!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
A while back I carelessly... bumped into 2nd Brother
You know the time now?
"Lazy boy, go and practice!"
"Master, have you heard of someone by the name Jin Tianyun?"
Why did you ask about him?
"Nothing, it's just that I've heard about"
How amazing Jin Tianyun's technique is
He is pretty skillful
A pity that he didn't come from a decent school
Just in case you run into him in future
You better turn away
"Master, will you turn away..."
If you run into him?
Nonsense!
"Gao Jian, if you'd rather leave us"
I'll make it easy for you!
"Master, you got me wrong"
Got you wrong?
"Master, this blockhead... didn't really want to learn martial arts"
He just wants a place to stay
"And have three meals a day 3rd Brother, can you shut up!"
"Yeah, I have your number all right, Crystal."
You call me when you're ready to discuss this.
I'm in town.
"Well, they tried, Will."
"Amy and Ty, they did their best."
You know what?
I think I'm just getting too old... for all this.
I'm sick and tired of fighting.
"Actually, no."
"Actually, what I'm sick and tired of is losing."
"Losing fights, losing them horses..."
There's not much left to lose anymore.
"- Nah, that's not true."
- Oh no?
"Well, what would you know about it?"
"Look, Sam doesn't come up here to see me no more."
Now Joanna's met this guy and she's taking off with him.
Lost my best friend this last winter.
"On top of everything else, my health is totally giving out."
Now it's my lungs and don't be telling Joanna.
"Look, you don't wanna lose anything else, then move!"
Go with her.
It seems pretty simple from where I'm standing.
"Oh, it seems pretty simple to Mr. High-and-mighty, does it?"
You're telling me to do something you'd never do yourself.
Am I right?
"Your wife travels, she moves around, but you're ""independent."" You don't gotta go nowhere."
It's a fancy way of saying that you're gonna stay put.
"People wanna see you, they gotta come where you're at."
You're not gonna move anywhere.
"So don't be giving me advice that you wouldn't take yourself, thank you."
"- Come on, will..."

"Look, I don't know what I would have done without my friends when I was pregnant."
"You need to meet some girls, some girls your age."
"Uh, it's kind of hard to make friends with girls my age when I'm pregnant."
"Well, you made a friend and you're pregnant."
My point exactly.
"Ethan wants to be my friend, even maybe my boyfriend."
You think there are any girls here who want to be my friend?
No.
And I don't care.
You suck.
You suck.
"Kathy, that is not how you make friends."
She was staring at me.
We were staring at her.
"Thought she was going to say hello, at least, I was hoping she was going to say hello."
Well she didn't.
Because you told her that she sucks.
Here.
Let me help you out.
"Hey, uh, excuse me."
You mind if I ask you a question?
"Get your hands off me and no, you can't ask me something, weirdo."
See?
"Hi, excuse me."
Speed is critical ; especially the eyes
In Chinese boxing there are some ambiguous elements
One must learn to balance them... and thereby testing your opponent
You have to know all that to win
What I'm showing you now is close range
At the time of actual wrestling...
Gather your power and attack at short range
It is indeed very powerful!
"That's the so called Extreme fist, very agile"
Can you do that?
Exactly copy?
Sorry!
Watch me
Sometimes even tofu can make one choke
T ake your time!
"If it was simple, everyone could be a Master"
You broke it?
"Y es, my head!"
Did you find Jin Tianyun?
Couldn't find anywhere
"Chief, you think he has left this Phoenix town?"
That's impossible.
He's wounded.
Can't go far
Keep on searching!
"Brother Jin, how's that?"
Not bad?
"Very powerful, right?"
It's actually more than that
It's extremely powerful from top to toe!
"See, it's more broken than a broken body!"
Don't be so proud
- That's always a good sign.
It had to be them.
I know where they are.
"I'll get back to you, Frank."
"Here, show me on the map."
I figured I must have been around here.
But I couldn't understand what Edgar was doing there.
"Then I realised, if he was fighting the weather, and wound up somewhere east of the mountains, about here, he'd have a straight shot over the mountains into Pasco."
He must have took the chance that he had enough gas.
You always take chances like that?
"If not, the mail wouldn't get through."
- This is Capital Peak.
- They must be on this ridge.
"About halfway down the big saddle, there's a clearing in the timber."
What I saw must have been wings.
Get the mail out by train.
He'll take out number eight.
Go as quickly as you can.
You'll have company.
I'm sending everyone up as soon as they refuel.
- He comes through after all.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe our luck is changing.
Jim.
- We could get married.
- What makes you say that?
I cancelled the letters out in our names.
You ever do that?
"You write some boy's last name and then yours underneath, and you cross out the letters that are the same."
"If there are a lot of crosses, you can get married."
A lot of ours do.
- No!
"It's you, with your insistence on being kowtowed to at every bloody opportunity!"
"Oh, my God!"
Excuse me.
"I want some milk, I'm thirsty."
"His landlord found him in his apartment crying, hyperventilating."
"- Apparently, his girlfriend left him."
"- The term would be "" mommy. """
- What?
- Mommy.
"Well, he appears to be an Aby."
"You know, an adult baby?"
"It's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of in every way by a "" mommy"" or a ""daddy. """
You're familiar with this condition?
It's not really a condition.
It's more like a form of relaxation.
- Are you kidding me?
"- No, it says right here:"
"""Abies like to relinquish control, get away from their stressful lives. """
"- Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?"
- Shoe sales.
A foot fetish too.
This is an issue for the Psych Department.
No offense.
I am not so sure about that.
"Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you?"
This morning.
"More than likely, he suffers from a diaper rash, which is a medical ailment to be treated by the ER."
- When are you done with this rotation?
- Next week.
Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
"""To Dr. Pratt, thanks from a grateful patient."
But you're wasting your time.
I didn't kill Bob Keaton.
"But you did process the scene, which means you do know who did kill him."
I'm not at liberty to say.
"Mr. Park, what can you tell me ?"
That this case doesn't exist.
And neither do I.
"Well, then, how do you explain me ?"
Lieutenant Caine... nothing good comes from waking ghosts.
I think you know what I mean.
"But if you can wake them, then maybe... they're not ghosts."
"Hey, Alexx."
"Hey, Ryan."
Did you determine the cause of death on my quarterback ?
Blunt-force trauma was the cause.
And I may have also found the person who caused it.
I found this in his pants pocket.
"I know about the curve, you're a dead man."
"""Curve..."""
What kind of curve ?
"Whatever it was, guess it was something worth killing for."
That's weird.
Note has perforated edges.
It looks like dot-matrix printer paper.
Who uses that kind of paper these days ?
Exactly.
I didn't write any note to Patrick.
You pulled me out of the reunion for this ?
"Yeah, we did."
You wrote the note 15 years ago.
You can't prove that.
The paper was the first indication.
"I... hmm... the power of love a skyscraping dove... flame on, burn desire love with tongues of fire..."
Clarissa.
She's alive.
"I'll be kind if you'll be faithful you be sweet and I'll be grateful fortune teller said I'd be free and that's the day you came to me mmm, mmm came to me mmm, mmm"
"da-da-de-dah-dah da-dum-da-da-dum come to me, my sweetest friend can you feel my heart again?"
I'll take you back where you belong and this will be our favorite song come to me with secrets bare
"I'll love you more, so don't be scared and when we're old and near the end we'll go home and start again mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm."
You missed the wedding.
I thought it best.
I've been thinking about what's best
For all of us as well.
I'm leaving.
You needn't worry.
And yet I do.
So you won't be leaving us just yet.
I have some news to share.
Turns out the english queen isn't dead after all.
The english queen is alive?
But I would keep the news to yourself.
You did this.
To see me married.
The messenger's news was flawed.
No one could blame that on me.
Or you.
Everyone needs a little push on occasion.
Even queens.
Even France.
All happiness comes with a price.
And you paid yours with another's broken heart.
Sebastian...
Will survive.
It's time for the consummation.
"""I'm doing this because"
"I am your daughter"""
and there's this wonderful moment of recognition.
"No, I still can't read it."
It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate.
But this will.
"It's your daughter's name, in the language of the forest."
I know my daughter's name.
"Except, they don't have a word for ""Pond,"""
because the only water in the forest is the river.
"The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her, whatever it takes, and I know that."
It's me.
I'm Melody.
I'm your daughter.
That reveal was another Moffat moment that I got at the exact instant he wanted.
Holy crap.
"This whole time, really?"
The whole time.
"Once you see it, you're like ""of course!"
"Like Melody, Song;"
"Pond, River"""
and you feel like such an idiot.
"It was a good little surprise, there,"
Steven Moffat.
It makes perfect sense now.
Makes perfect sense.
"The Lady Cassandra is the last human, self-described."
"At this point, she doesn't look anything like a human."
"She's had so many plastic surgeries that she's literally just a sheet of skin, with eyes and a mouth and nose holes."
Because she had her chin removed because she said it made her look fat.
She's not unlike women I've met.
I lived in Hollywood for eight years.
"Dad, have you ever asked me what I really wanted to do?"
How dare you talk to my dad like that?
Get up and go to your room.
You are acting as if these people want the worst for you.
Did you see that?
I have just said one word and he has spoiled my dinner.
I'm ashamed of you.
You're vile!
I didn't do anything to make anyone feel ashamed.
"All animals are lions, in fact... all people are animals, isn't that right, sir?"
"Yes, it is."
"Then, if all living things that are lions are animals... animals that are living are lions."
"Then, if p is to q or q is to r..."
All lions are animals.
All tigers are lions.
The bottom line is that all living...
What's important is to be human.
Be a man!
This is what you should always try to learn.
"Dear children, live life as a way of documentary."
How much time do we have till the break?
Damn it!
Kaan.
Come here.
He's going to give the questions again.
You take this and go to the stationery across the street.
How many copies do you need?
Make 40 copies of it.
Tell them to charge it to Professor Rahmi.
I bet that he won't even open it to check the questions.
What do you mean?
The teacher gives him questions and he never looks at them?
Prison?
"Oh, God, don't even say that word."
"Honey, it's okay."
"I know it's going to be okay, really."
How does everything change in a day?
"It's probably just business stuff, you know?"
Cutting corners and inspectors.
Remember Daddy used to bribe inspectors.
He did not.
He left an envelope of $20 bills in the kitchen so they could take it.
He did?
But his kitchen was unbelievably clean.
You have to pay in order to stay in business.
You think that's what Rick did?
How do I know?
"But it's a pretty big project, so who knows how many people might want a piece?"
Don't worry. I hear those white-collar prisons are okay.
They play golf with millionaires.
Municipal waiting rooms can be so dreary.
- l thought you'd left town.
- Why would I do that?
Why haven't you returned my calls?
- To protect the innocent.
- And who does that include?
Whomever you want it to.
"All right, look, do you understand how much I have riding here?"
"My career, my whole life?"
"This is scary. lt's really scary for me, Miles, and I need to ask you, do I have anything to worry about?"
Did you do anything wrong?
"All right, look, the second permit for the high-rise, it was supposed..."
"Shh, shh."
[ classical music playing] lt was supposed to take six weeks.
Tell me...
"- Do you understand british divorce courts, Mr. Collins?"
- Sorry.
"UK law, elementary requirements."
Not at all.
My situation is such that discretion in this case with this single young woman is both financially and publically essential.
"So you, you do know about Zack Starr?"
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
"Only what Krista told me over the pillow, so to speak."
How did you two meet?
Social function.
"I was at a gallery opening, she walked in, and, I noticed."
It happened like that.
Did it?
So can you tell me where she is now?
No.
I haven't seen her in a few days.
"And to be quite honest, she finds me,"
"I don't have a number or an address,"
- just a willingness to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.
I tell you what.
"If you meet me at this park,"
"I've got a meeting downtown, I'll... have some of my people dig her up for you."
"I'm sorry, poor choice of words, but I'm sure once I get them onto it."
I'll be able to tell you exactly where she's been found.
"Now if there's nothing else, I think we're done here."
"There is one more thing, Mr. Van Sciver."
Do you know what this symbol is?
Should I?
That wasn't my question.
I'm proud to say that we've grown yet again.
We have three new guests.
"For the new ones, first off a few words..."
"This is a hotel, but at the same time we offer a lot of space... a lot of free space."
Kind of a community...
Sort of an organism.
A place where everyone can come and contribute with their life experience  above all this is a place that doesn't obey the rules of the market nor that of greed.
Our first guest is Emilia.
Well I'm a photographer  and I like to sing.
Then tell us what you like to sing.
German songs  chansons  opera  everything.
I also like to sing Schubert.
What else should I say about myself?
I have a tumor the size of an egg.
Right in here  and sometimes it gives me a headache.
"Yes well, I like to sing."
We know each other from before.
Emilia was in the hospital a long time as well.
Too long.
And... she's a good writer!
Thank you.
"Yes, I'm Josephine Reiter and I want to make something about Franz  and your community."
That's why there's a camera.
- A film!
About you Franz!
- For television.
Let her continue!
I thought it would be helpful if something about you was shown.
Does anyone need help here?
I don't need any help.
I don't either.
I don't need anyone.
What was it that you asked me?
"Well, sir, it was only what you said about being fixed up with an alibi."
"I mean, did he have a reason to?"
"Lieutenant, would you mind speaking clearly?"
Did who have a reason to do what?
"Make an alibi, sir, your friend."
"I mean, were you watching the ballgame at ten minutes to nine, sir, with him?"
"Oh, I see."
Well...
"Yes, I suppose I was."
"I don't have an exact memory about time, that's why I have Mark."
"And if he says I was, I was."
He's very responsible about time.
That's what makes him a superior gofer.
"You think she was murdered, don't you?"
"I beg your pardon, sir?"
You heard me.
"Yes, sir, I did."
I mean...
"Yes, I do think it was a premeditated killing, sir."
"I mean, I think the robbery was staged to cover-up the murder."
"How did you know, sir?"
Why else would you be here?
"It could be just a routine check, sir."
"No, Lieutenant."
"They don't send a police detective stumbling around asking silly, fake-innocent questions on a routine check."
I know that from my show.
"Well, silly, fake-innocent questions like what, sir?"
(CHUCKLES)
"Like, ""Mr. Daley wasrt at home last night."
"""He wasrt there this morning."
They told me at the office.
- Are you trying to shut down my performance?
"- You may have your event, if after the performance, you give up the girl."
- That's ridiculous.
- You've grown too attached.
The society has decided that they will do with Isabel as they see fit.
It's time for her to be placed.
- I refuse.
- I thought all these characters...
I thought it was part of my therapy.
"But then I started having all these dreams, and some of them turned out to be real, like..."
like... like hurting you and and Roderick.
I don't know what happened to Roderick.
He did this to me.
They need to be punished.
But how?
- Gunther.
"- You should go back to your room, Mary."
- You fill the goblets for the society rituals?
"Please, help us, Gunther."
- Thank you.
"- There's something you should know, ma'am, about one of the men who's judging you tonight."
"Look for the one that says ""wolf's bane."""
- This?
- Yes.
"- Hide, hide, hide."
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.
End this.
- Why are you in here?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Is the disgusting... repulsive little urchin sampling my wares?
'Cause he can handle any situation.
"I think if he was accused of a sexual scandal, he wouldn't even care."
"Reporters come at him,"
"""Eddie, so you slept with some congresswomen, man."
"What you got to say?"""
He'll be...
"""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
"""Let me tell your ass something right now."
"""I just want to be honest with you right now."
"""Let me tell you something right now."
"""Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"""I did it."
I slept with her.
"""Let me tell you something."
"It was good,"""
"""it was sexy, and in the morning, we had waffles."""
"""Oh, yes."
"""And I would have slept with your ass too,"
"""'cause I love sex."
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Please don't tweet that.
I like my job.
"Don't tweet it, okay?"
"I know it 'cause there's always a group of women ready to tweet something and mess up somebody's career, even though, observationally, groups of women together are so funny, 'cause one of y'all always ends up"
getting too drunk...
"Oh, my God!"
Flirting with the wrong--
We've learned a lot about you tonight.
"Getting too drunk, flirting with the wrong guy, and then your girlfriend's gotta play Save-A-Ho and get you out the situation."
It's so funny.
"As soon as it happens, the girlfriend's like this, the one that's trying to cock-block, she's like,"
David.
What's wrong?
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
How?
Why don't you tell me?
What do you mean?
"I told you, I didn't go there."
I know what you told me.
"You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here."
"Yes, and that's the truth."
Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight.
"You know... you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did."
"If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first."
Because remember?
You called me tonight.
"I am here because of you, David."
"What happened, Sherry?"
I went over to the house just to speak to Julia.
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument and... he had a heart attack.
There's going to be an investigation.
You're going to have to tell the truth about this.
The truth isn't going to save either one of us.
"All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes."
"Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months?"
What did you do to Alan?
"Honestly, David,"
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Kim,"
I transferred that feed to your system.
Which I don't really have.
"So, what I'm trying to say is that I really, really need this scholarship."
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah.
"Like, 14 times in front of the mirror."
"Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much."
The Robinson is going to go to someone who dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
"Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition."
We're building a robotic wheel that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
"Well, I'm designing the system."
So...
Right.
"Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook, a Korean immigrant who has only one leg."
"Well, I have both my legs."
"Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?"
That was a joke.
"Ben, it's all about the essay."
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
"What can you tell me, Ben, that's going to dazzle me?"
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Where is your jacket?
"- Oh, I got it."
I got it.
It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow!
And nocturnal.
And fly.
"Okay, I think we're getting into bat territory again, and I want to steer us away from that."
Like a bat.
"Bats are everywhere, so."
They're really not.
Let's stay on track.
We're just gonna talk about fears about the baby.
What about baby-- baby bats?
"We're not gonna go down the bat thing again this class, okay?"
"Well, as long as it's black, though."
"We're both black, so it's gonna be black."
- A black baby.
- It's gonna be black.
How many of you have even seen a bat?
In real life?
"Okay, there we go."
You can't really get away from bats.
"Let's just keep it on the discussion that we had going, which is: what your worries are about the baby."
"Uh, we're Jewish, but we were afraid that our baby's going to be, like, too Jewish?"
Yeah.
"Like, two sets of dishes Jewish."
"And mark my words, no child of mine is gonna (bleep) through a sheet, okay?"
- Uh...
- My biggest fear... is that our baby will want to participate in SantaCon.
That's where they dress up like Santa?
I-
- I won that.
A couple years ago.
"I have to say yes, fear of a shit baby in this day and age, it's a-- it's a valid concern."
Okay.
"Well, if we're really sharing things,"
"Hey, Alice."
"- Hiya, Ed."
"-Well, is, uh... loveable big stuff home yet?"
(chuckles)
"Yes, he's inside washing up."
"Ed, do you realize they have another emergency meeting tonight at the lodge?"
That's the fourth emergency meeting in this past week.
I'm beginning to think those emergency meetings are nothing but a poker game.
"Oh, wait a minute, Alice."
Wait a minute.
I'm surprised that you even think anything like that.
An emergency meeting is an emergency meeting.
Never a poker game.
An executive meeting-- that's a poker game.
Will you tell your lodge brother for me that I'm up at Mrs. Manicotti's?
I will do.
Hey there.
"What say, Ralph?"
Mmm!
Alice told me to tell you she's up at Mrs. Manicotti's.
Mmm!
"Boy, this is delicious."
"Norton... if I ever ran into you when you weren't eating,"
I don't think I'd know you.
"What kills me is you eat and you eat and you eat, and you don't even gain a pound."
"I guess my nature, my basic metabolism or something, I don't know."
"As long as I can remember,"
I've weighed exactly what I weigh now-- 165 pounds.
"As-as far back as I remember, 165."
"Gee, I remember when I used to weigh 165."
Did you ever see a picture of me when I weighed 165 pounds?
"No, Ralph, I never did see any of your baby pictures."
And you?
I trusted you.
I had to do what was best for my family.
- Don't you ever call me again.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Not sorry enough.
What are you reading?
Seeing with Serenity:
How to Cope With What Life Deals You.
I took a trip to the self-help section at the bookstore.
"So far, it's just pages and pages of vague platitudes."
"Mom, you've been avoiding my calls."
I didn't know what I wanted to say.
I wish I could turn back the clock and make a different decision.
- But I can't.
- I know.
You seem angrier at me than Kevin or Tommy.
Am I wrong?
Probably not.
You hold me to a different standard than anyone else.
That's not fair.
Yes.
"You're right, it's not fair."
I just always felt this connection with you.
You raise a boy and you don't expect them to tell you anything.
You're lucky if they acknowledge you on their way out the door.
But you always confided in me.
I felt like you trusted me to handle whatever came along.
I never had that relationship with my mother.
I always thought I had it with you.
"Mom, we do have that relationship."
The last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette!
"Okay, Officer, I think we..."
we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
Let me check with my supervisor.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
"I missed you at Dad's funeral, Mare."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
You know the last time I saw you was at Mom's funeral?
I guess that's the way we do our family reunions.
"'Cause I was thinking it could've been cool to have a picnic in between, or something, you know?"
- A picnic?
- Yeah.
A picnic.
"Something that, I don't know, normal families do?"
"How did you say you were injured, again?"
"Well, originally, uh... playing high school baseball, but, uh, it hasn't bothered me in a really long time."
"Anything traumatic recently, with the knee?"
"Yeah, actually."
I got a new partner.
I was thinking more about a physical injury.
"No, no, this-this guy is like a physical injury, Doc."
"Ten minutes after meeting him,"
"I get shot and blasted backwards through a window, okay?"
"A few hours after that, he drives a car-- not joking-- onto the deck of a Chinese freighter ship."
"And, yes, I was in it."
"The car, not the ship."
He drove a car onto a boat?
Barry:
I don't understand that.
Why me?
"You know, I'm so small compared to what these other people are doing."
"You know, it just doesn't make sense to me."
Morris:
"Caught between the machetes of law enforcement and the bank accounts of businessmen, the small-time growers are going to have to fight to survive."
I had such a dream of being able to grow legally my whole life.
"We're kind of hanging on by our fingertips, but we're gonna fight."
We're gonna fight for our place all the way to the end.
Morris:
Will you do it again?
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
"It's just, you know, why bother?"
Previously on X Company...
I have a proposition.
It's an informal prisoner exchange.
"It's your son Klaus, he's in a Russian POW camp."
I can have him transferred to a Canadian POW camp.
I need a man transferred out of the Gestapo HQ in Paris.
"Go, go, go!"
_
_
- Do you remember the deal we made?
- Short and sweet.
No strings.
"- Anyway, I don't mean to..."
- No.
It was nice.
"In three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France."
"Alright, put in an aircomms request with all the main providers."
I want a name and address as soon as possible.
"If you want my opinion, from the blood on the back of the door the attack looks like it started when she came out of the bathroom."
"Ally, you be the victim."
- Why me?
- Because you're...
"Alright, you be the victim."
"Go on, get in touch with your female side."
She should probably have a leak in the bathroom.
You don't have to do that part.
When she comes out... she gets a blow to the back of her head.
Now it's bad but doesn't kill her.
She goes on the bed.
Now she's probably out cold when the attacker comes at her again.
Are you enjoying this?
"Now, the attacker is covered in blood."
"The traces we found in the bathroom,"
I reckon he took time to wash before making his or her - equally - exit.
Where are you going?
I've just bludgeoned you to death.
Mark!
Happy birthday!
"I was just out for a run, so I, erm, I thought I'd surprise you."
- Right.
"- Life lesson there, isn't here?"
Should never turn up unannounced.
I saw him leave.
So what was Kenton doing here?
Did he stay the night?
"Laura, can you talk to me please?"
Is there any point in lying?
Why would you do that?
He wears a wire.
I think it's really unprofessional of you to come to a counseling session high.
Don't go.
Please.
I can't trust you anymore.
I guess I'd say that.
Is this your mom's?
The best thing to do when your mom's a drug dealer is to just pretend it's not happening.
"The first time I did this, I was 16, with my mother."
"Your mother didn't die of cancer, did she?"
I really thought I knew you.
"Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound to the upper thigh."
Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance?
Yes.
I'll take him from here.
"Come on, Grady."
It's too late.
"- Oh, God."
- Ugh!
Poor Sid.
"We are going to get caught, and I cannot get caught."
"Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave me and my family alone?"
I meant it.
I want answers about my son.
"What he needed was someone to say, ""Keep fighting."""
"Instead, he found someone that said, ""You can give up."""
"Well, look who it is, the Angel of Death."
I want a new partner.
Do you think our past dictates our future?
"Everything that's happened in our lives has brought us to this moment here, you asking me to help you kill people."
"That would be the past dictating the present, and no, I think we have more control than that."
How much do people pay?
I didn't really get a good look at them.
"Don't you lie to me, Charles."
We're gonna pull out of here and forget we even saw them.
"Betty, do you know how much I like you?"
"I remember, faintly."
"I found out you can't always do or say what you want to that is, unless your father lets you."
Rodney are you going through all your life only doing what your father lets you do?
"Only having the friends that he picks out for you wearing what he tells you to wear, thinking his thoughts?"
"Betty, I'm old enough, but he's a tough man to handle."
- You've got to do it someday.
"- Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's...
It's called marriage.
Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
You're the only girl I've ever wanted.
Rodney... .
"Rodney, not that way."
What good is life if I know I didn't have the guts to live it my way?
Rodney.
I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
- All gone.
- Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes.
"Mystic Falls is our home, Damon."
They took that from us.
"Our land, our home."
It's time we rebuild.
"What, are you crazy?"
That was 1864.
"Wake up, woman."
The world has moved on.
"As a reward, I'm willing to give you what you want most."
- I want nothing...
- Katherine.
You wouldn't even know where she was.
You've been underground a century and a half.
Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls.
"I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her."
I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again.
There's no way I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
"I'm not asking for your help, Damon."
Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness.
The rest is nonnegotiable.
"I have 400 years on you, little boy."
"I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking, and you know it."
I'll be in touch.
You got me flowers.
"Well, I figured it's a date, why not do it right?"
"I would have driven too, but you're the one with the car."
"You know, you'd think that for someone who was around when the car was invented, that you'd have one."
"Oh, I have one."
I just never drive it.
"You know, it's not too late to cancel."
Why would we do that?
I don't know.
This is a high treason to the Federation!
Go to hell!
That gave me luck.
"It was almost a palette, until I met my new friends."
"It's good to see you alive, brother."
Who put us in charge of the world?
How did our lie become our truth?
Nobody cares to remember.
The cold heart of nature now forms honest men on the ice.
"And under the area of death, life comes."
"After 300 years of slavery,"
The humanoids are walking towards their freedom.
"We did it, Mara!"
Thank you my love.
I'll see you upstairs.
In a world invaded by cowards.
The only thing left for a man is to fight.
"Fight, until hell freezes."
Then fight them on the ice.

"Let's say that in a year, Episode 5 you'll die."
You're going to die in a year...
"You'd only have a year left, is there something you'd like to do or see?"
A year is too long.
Let's do just 3 months left.
Okay then.
Let's say you only have 3 months left.
"I'll live recklessly, and take care of people who backstabbed me."
I'll kill the bastards I don't like.
This is not the goal of this documentary.
"Brah, we don't have a few hours."
"If we don't find this guy by the end of this feed, this girl is as good as dead."
"Yeah, enough with the pressure, man."
And I haven't even smoked my morning bowl yet.
ADDISON:
The truth is
I haven't been honest about who I am and the mistakes that I have made.
And now I'm going to confess.
We're running out of time.
Five years ago in Pl... (playing upbeat song)
What the hell just happened?
She just got played off by Fatso the Keyboard Cat.
Somebody deliberately knocked that feed offline.
And that someone was me.
"Toast, what are you doing?"
I'm getting you your location the only way I know how.
Holm can't reestablish a connection without exposing his location.
It's genius.
And what if he just decides to kill this girl?
What then?
Then I guess I'll look pretty dumb.
This doesn't change anything.
"When that light goes back on, you say exactly what I told you to."
It worked.
He took the bait.
Not so fast.
I still have to zero in on his location.
How long?
"17 seconds, give or take."
ADDISON:
This is my confession.
"Five years ago in Plymouth, Minnesota I was driving my car late at night... when I struck a pedestrian, killing him instantly."
How about that carpenter?
He treats me well
"But he wants a son, and I want an id card"
"When he got a son, and I get my id card"
He won't force me to be with him
He might even give me some money then I can do whatever I want
What do you want to do anyway?
I want to go to Taiwan
Then what do you want to do in Hong Kong?
Me?
"I want to be rich I want to earn a lot of money, and enjoy myself"
Can't you be rich in Thailand?
If I could would I have come to Hong Kong?
Then are you rich yet?
Do you know how to become rich?
"I know Hung Fist, and have learnt Thai Boxing too lf l combine the 2 styles they are no match to me"
"Just wait and see, I will win"
Does it hurt?
Do you feel the pain?
"This is Ah Mut Sha, your opponent"
He's testing the power of his opponent
"Watch out for his elbow, he's quick"
"He's Chan Kam Kong, represented Hong Kong last time"
His punches are powerful
Have you seen his knee attacks?
Very lethal
Within one round
"One, two, three, four"
Again
Catch it
"Lousy Japanese stuff, hardly used it for over a day"
Save some money
"I was like, ""I don't know."
"We're probably gonna want water in ten years."""
"I want to live for today like everybody else, but I gotta live for tomorrow a little bit."
You know what I mean?
Look down the road.
"Look down the Fury Road, you guys."
Did anybody see that documentary?
Anybody see that?
"""I thought it was a film."" Did you?"
"""O.J. hated water."
"He hated water."""
"We'd go out, and I'd be like, ""O.J."
"Need some water."""
I will say this.
I don't do impressions 'cause I'm shitty at 'em.
"But I promise you, this one is pretty close."
It's pretty close.
"When you finally watch that documentary, you're, ""Oh, my God."
It's a shame that guy killed himself.
"He could have made money doing voices."""
You know what?
O.J.
I don't like how some people react when glass breaks.
Have you seen these people?
What if this was my whole show?
"""Have you guys seen these people?"""
"Glass breaks, they're like, ""Nobody touch it!"""
Shut the fuck up.
This is nobody's first broken glass rodeo.
"Nobody's running over like, ""Here, let me scoop up a lot of the shards with my bare forearms."
Put all the pieces in my mouth till I find a trash can at some point.
"No, put the shards of glass into my mouth."""
"On the first day of each month, we always did that."
"I've come this far, at least give me some porridge."
You really don't know the etiquette?
Where did your mother go?
"All right, I will find food to eat by myself."
I'm very hungry.
Is there ramen?
What are you doing?
Why are you looking through others belongings?
It's here.
Do you want to eat as well?
Shall I cook for two?
Looks delicious.
This kimchi is like art work!
Don't spill it.
That way the tablecloth must be replaced.
You should have thrown it away earlier.
It's already become like this.
Just buy a new one.
This tablecloth is the only one in the world.
My mother sewed the table cloth to fit the table my father made.
Then ask her to sew another one.
Is collecting red stickers your hobby?
"Here, there, almost everywhere."
Why did you tear it down?
"That... you really don't know, so that's why you ask me?"
"If I knew, why would I ask you?"
You should also know that my dad... has been in the hospital for ten years.
"My mom was there as well, and died because of the accident."
The bank said they would take household appliances.
That's why they stuck it there.
But now I have a job to pay off the debt.
-Hiram?
Great.
What is he?
An assistant librarian with little pince-nez glasses and a nervous twitch?
"God, I never realised you had such a fertile imagination."
"Well, what was I supposed to say?"
That I came around to break the news to you our relationship was over?
-He'd have gone potty.
-What relationship?
-We never had a relationship.
"-Okay, look, we got to make a move, sweetheart."
"Mick says he can help shift my stuff back today if we get there by 3:00, so...."
"Oh, yeah, the other thing, Gil, and it's bit of an odd one."
"My mother, you know she's in this nursing home now in Lower Ledbury, and maybe the old marbles are starting to go or what I don't know, I mean, she's 81 ."
But all she kept saying when I was there yesterday is how much she wanted to see you.
Me?
Are you joking?
Why would she want to see me?
I don't think I've ever even met the lady.
"Well, I said I'd pass it on."
"Anyway, look, we'll see you around, okay?"
"And, you know, I really hope it works out for Hiram."
Right.
Thank you.
-What is it?
You're not ill or anything?
"-No, it's nothing like that."
No.
"Well, then listen, if you've got your health,"
"I tell you, there is nothing else in life worth getting that upset about."
"So, come on, you can share it with me."
What's the problem?
- Who the roses from?
- Amber.
"Damn, those are nice."
Must be her apology for yesterday's behavior.
"Nigga, you sent these to Amber to apologize to her."
She just sent them back.
- I did?
"- Yeah, you had me do it."
"Wait, you don't remember this?"
"Oh, yeah."
"It's still nice, though."
What kind of red is this?
Rose red?
I don't...
"""Are you an enemy of the league?"" What does that even mean?"
"Well, it's a threat, Joe."
"I mean, it's really fucking subtle, but it's still a threat."
"Well, they can't do shit to us."
"Actually, they could ass-fuck us multiple ways, starting with our registration."
"- No, they couldn't."
- They can and they will.
"- Well, that would suck."
- Yep.
"They could also take away that ASM box we have at the Dolphins' game, too."
"- Oh, I love that box."
"- Yeah, so do I."
It's also a matter of credibility.
"The league can go after that, too."
"Let me tell you something, for two guys who didn't start off with a lot of that, we don't have shit to spare."
What's their fucking problem with you anyway?
"It's an old boys' club, Joe, all right?"
"I ain't old enough, I ain't white enough, and I sure as fuck ain't clean enough, and neither are you."
It isn't sex you're afraid of.
"It's love, that's what you can't handle."
"That's what you offer me, with your hands on me?"
"That's one expression, backed up by many things."
I haven't asked for any of them.
Understand what you're saying no to.
"When I take you in my arms, I commit to you, not just physically but all the way."
"That means I intend to worry about you, to take care of you and that's what I want back from you, without any reservations or shame."
- Either you're up to that or not.
- I have my standards and pride.
They're not enough for anyone.
"You need someone to trust, to love."
"No, I don't."
I don't!
"Now, just leave me alone."
I can but I don't want to.
Let me help you.
I don't care if you hang back.
I'll give it time.
I can't.
The offer is always open.
I don't know if you'll take it up but perhaps it'll make you feel better to know it's there.
Hello.
"Yes, Marion."
I don't believe it.
Are you positive?
No.
"No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself."
"Operator, will you please connect me with Evelyn Page?"
I don't believe Norman did what you said.
Two people saw them.
- Marion has spread it all over town.
You've earned the right to see this.
"Hey, there, buddy."
It's me.
"And by ""me,"" I mean you."
"And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot, because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles."
What you discovered about Bracken's partnership with LokSat is too dangerous to pursue.
LokSat?
I knew about LokSat?
I am barely living proof.
I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat's plane was landing tonight.
I barely escaped without being identified.
I am erasing our mind for a reason...
To protect Kate.
"'Cause if she found out, then she will die."
"So do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles, for her sake."
Do you know what this means?
Yes.
You tracked LokSat.
"If we can cross-reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot, then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is."
"No, no."
It means what happened was my fault.
The murders of Beckett's former AG team...
"In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat,"
I inadvertently sentenced them all to death.

I am thinking about my daughter.
"Tammy, we have some hard stuff... to talk about."
Your dad is in a coma.
From being stabbed?
He hit his head.
And Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
We're doing everything that we can.
"Look, I know this is really hard and I know you don't want to talk about it, and believe me, I know what that's like."
"But your mom's in trouble with the police, and I don't want her to be in more trouble."
"And this should not be your responsibility, but she says that it's all her fault, what happened, and... well, I don't believe her."
And... if you told the police what really happened... well...
I'm supposed to say it was an accident.
But it wasn't?
No.
No.
"Tammy, look, whatever your dad did... it wasn't him."
"I was cutting a cantaloupe, and my dad came in."
He started singing with the radio.
"He was being funny, but I got so mad."
I don't know.
It just cos over me.
My dad could see it was happening.
"He held me to calm me down, but I bit him."
"And he yelled for my mom, and they both tried to stop me."
"I had the knife in my hand, so I stabbed him."
And now he's gonna die.
I see you have a new rug.
Pete tells me you're afraid to leave the house.
"I said that you could come see the baby, not shrink my brain."
Your body language is telling me that you're uncomfortable.
My vocal language is telling you that I'm fine.
Really.
- What'd she say?
- Garcia says this looks like a list of additives needed to weaponize anthrax.
Could they get enough anthrax?
"The letter sent to senator Tom Daschle's office in 2002 only contained two grams of purified spores, enough to kill 25 million people if effectively distributed."
Are you willing to have a chat with me?
Go ahead.
Gideon.
Let's chat.
He's from Egypt.
Cairo.
- You sure?
"- No, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian."
What type of name is Gideon?
American.
"I often forget that in your culture, you put your country first and your god last."
"Sir, he was born and raised in egypt."
"They pronounce ""J"" sounds as a ""G""."
You don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?
Egyptian.
"In two minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in two months."
"They and I have... very, very different motives and methodologies."
And yet your country relies on them to protect you from us.
Sometimes they're their own worst enemy.
Yeah.
"Who is your worst enemy, agent Gideon?"
It's not a who.
It's a what.
Ignorance.
You're a very honest man.
And you?
"Must have become a hafez by what,"
- age 10?
"We'll be on our own again, eh?"
"Well, don't forget Mr Nibbles."
Yeah.
Have you seen him this evening?
"No, but his food's gone, so hopefully that was him."
"And I cleaned up a mess in the linen cupboard, hopefully that was him."
"Oh, yes, it's good to be loved."
Good night.
"Morning, Mary."
"I just wanted to say, I hope there's going to be no hard feelings."
In fact I got you a little something just to let you know how much
I value your experience and I'm looking forward to working with you.
Thank you very much.
"I don't drink, but that can go to the cleaners."
"Well, there you go."
I just hope we can move forward and forward our nifty little team.
"Yes, professionalism above all else."
"Jenny, I need you to wee into the cup here."
What?
I just need to check you're not on heroin.
Heroin?
"Yeah, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt but there's been an accusation from a member of staff that you might have been injecting in front of the patients, so..."
"How many miles are you on these days, Len?"
1672.
Just- just outside Kiev.
Kiev?

"- Don't touch the chart, please!"
I'm thinking about getting myself a bike actually.
Oh!
"You know, one of those fold-outs for the commute."
"Ah, kid was breaking our hearts, telling us about his girlfriend dumping him."
"You know, saying how much he had to win in order to buy her an engagement ring."
"We kept saying that he should just forget about her, but, no, he just kept playing."
Until you stole all his money.
I thought about giving some of it back.
Yeah.
That's right.
"But then, that kid-- he just went nuts."
"Flipped the table over, and he just ran out."
- Where?
- How should I know?
"Hate to break Rule 22, boss, but his lawyer's here."
Then I'm done talking.
Oops.
Got the same story from the blackjack dealer.
"If what he says is even half true,"
Petty Officer Adams could have left that game and picked a fight with the first person that he saw.
Could be anyone.
Thoughts?
"Well, with no security cameras at the pizzeria,"
Ziva and McGee are checking neighboring stores.
"Ye, I know that."
"I asked you your thoughts, DiNozzo."
My thoughts?
"I thought you didn't like my process, my yabba yabba."
Doesn't mean I don't depend on it.
Oh.
"Well, in that case, the pizza guys are slimeballs."
Thin crust beats deep dish every time.
"And every suspect in this case has an answer for everything, but one of them's got to be lying."
- Yeah?
Which one?
He wasn't?
He knew.
It was just one of those things that happens.
"He was growing up, and that was hard for you both."
"He loved you very, very much, Mr Watson."
And that's what he was thinking when he died.
I just wish I could see him one more time.
I wish I could tell him that I was sorry.
"He knows, Mr Watson."
He knows.
( cries )
"It's okay, Dad."
You can let go.
Now I can see why those people want you so badly.
"When it gets dark, we shoot for the windows again."
"At the same time, we bring two men through the hallway."
"He'll be down on the floor, won't be looking to the door."
We've got a man up in the heating ducts.
"He'll coordinate by earphone, drop down through at the same time the two men from the hall enter."
And then he turns and shoots the girl.
That room is covered by snipers.
These men know what they're doing.
"It all goes by the numbers, we take him out."
- And the others?
- Not a problem.
I don't want my father to see you do it.
You look like a college kid doing his homework.
- What are you working on?
"- Oh, just a little theory."
"Their craft was, I like to call it, thought-powered."
"Allie may be a stronger manifestation of that power, that energy."
How long have you been sleeping with my daughter?
'
I'm telling my advisor all this and I look in her trash can... and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.
"I pictured her sitting in this shoebox of an office, eating a banana by herself... and I almost felt sorry for her."
"Then she questioned my judgment about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her."
"She was welling up at the end, but she held it in until I was gone."
I have enough faculty recommendations to run for Student Council... so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
"Okay, one second, and open."
You made me a tassel-hat cake.
Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.
"- Yes, I am, aren't I?"
- Here.
I brought the pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.
"Hand them over, lady."
"- Okay, but don't laugh."
- I promise.
"I was younger then, not as refined."
- You're stoned.
- Totally.
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.
"If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off."
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.
I was nauseous all day.
Your parents?
"Heads or tails, it looks like you won."
It doesn't pay to split partners.
"Well, i suppose the drinks are on me."
"Come on, my little prune."
No.
Won't you join us?
I beg your pardon?
"I don't even know you, sir."
That's all right.
"None of the others do, either."
"I'm treating all new york tonight, just to teach myself a lesson."
"Come, dear."
No.
"I've learned, miss mansfield, that when a person wants to be a success, he can't dawdle around."
"You got to grab at every chance, use everybody you can to help you up that ladder."
"And the higher you go, the louder people will cheer for you."
"You think only in millions, don't you, mr."
Fisk?
"Yes, sirree."
Millions of everything.
"People, dollars, thrills."
"Every minute is a thrill for me, and i wouldn't give up one of my minutes for all the gold in the united states mint."
I bet it'll look prettier on you than it did in the jewelry store.
"Why, uh, don't you like it?"
Any woman would be crazy who didn't like it.
Mr. Fisk... i expect to be a great actress.
What do you expect me to be?
Whatever you want to be.
"This looks like money to you, doesn't it?"
It don't to me.
"You know, there are two sides to every dollar- a lot of fun making them, a lot of fun spending them."
I've got a lot of them.

Look at the size of the diamond he's holding.
This same old scene takes place in every story.
One dude makes a last minute entry and the engagement goes for a six...
You and your intense look.
Don't worry.
This won't happen to you.
Do you know why?
"Because women don't fall for the man, but the mansion."
Right?
You ditcher...
I left for a week and you left me.
Only if you had been a little more crazy... you would never have left me.
You remember what I had told you?
"You can give her a ring, but I'll be the one taking her home."
Remember that.
Stay for dinner.
I was only playing with destiny.
"Anyway, he will die as destined."
Go find him.
What's the angle?
Why have you come here?
Gossip girl has ruined our graduation
And it's only 2:00.
We have to stop her.
I don't know.
Messing with gossip girl?
Think of the consequences.
You can't ask us to jeopardize our futures for your personal vendetta.
Besides she didn't even say anything about us
Not even penelope.
Oh soup dumplings.
This is not my personal vendetta.
She attacked all of us and was wrong.
Completely.
Totally.
Well I'm gonna go do some damage control just in case
So don't wait for me.
Well what about you two?
Well of everyone here
You guys probably have the most secrets you're hiding.
I'll gather intel.
I'll run some stats.
I'm sorry...
About before.
About what part exactly?
the pre-graduation squabble
Or the fact that you no longer want to marry me?
What exactly is our problem anyway?
You tried to give me money behind my back
When i said no.
We both make mistakes.
But if we can't accept that about each other
How do we move forward?
ABBY:
Welcome to AUTEC and the surrounding areas of the Caribbean.
What is this?
The Bermuda Triangle.
And an ode to my inner mapper.
I'm marking the site of each and every amazing thing that happened here.
"Well, you can't just say that and not give us a little taste."
I wouldn't dream of it.
"Okay, so this bullet marks where the USS Cyclops vanished in the Triangle, and this bullet is the Bimini Wall."
It's a possible location for Atlantis.
"And this bullet, Gibbs, this is the Tongue of the Ocean."
"It's like an underwater Grand Canyon, and we think that AUTEC is running cables down more than 6,000 feet."
To what we don't know.
"Any of these bullets have a point, Abbs?"
The bullet that killed Ridgeway.
I traced that back to a company called Vita Foras.
Vita Foras.
It's Latin.
Rough translation:
"""Great Outdoors."""
I'd guess we're looking at hunting weapons?
You would guess right.
"More specifically, extremely rare hunting rifles, the kind that crazy hard-core collectors would trade."
Hard to track.
Exactly.
"Love your triangle, Abbs."
I...
I just have to ask.
You're in the business of proving things with science.
Why this need to chart the unexplainable?
"Wait, you're in my head, right?"
I'm just going to answer you in my thoughts.
This is all very dramatic but what makes you so sure
- you'll find The Beast tonight?
- Stay tuned.
"Jo, on me."
You know what's great about science?
Eventually it can achieve pretty much anything.
Just put in the hours in the lab and you... can make all sorts of cool things happen.
This is bait.
A scent engineered at a cellular level to attract the predatory olfactory system.
"Which is smart speak for ""it rocks""."
And this is your basic Sunday roast.
Before all the cooking and the gravy.
Add the scent.
"It'll spread and if there's a supernatural carnivore out there, it's going to come running."
I'm switching to night vision.
OK.
Let's fall back to the truck first.
Steve!
Do you smell that?
- So...
- No.
Sorry?
"You were either going to ask me if you could help, or try to find out something personal about me."
Either way the answer's no.
- It's cold out.
- I'm pretty warm actually.
Wasn't talking about the weather.
I see movement.
Ten o'clock.
What are you doing?
!
It's a tranquilliser gun.
- Yun-hwa!
What are you waiting for?
Come in and take a good look.
"But if you do not find the man you are looking for, there will be consequences for violating the privacy of a maiden."
"No, wait out there."
Are you satisfied?
What more do you want?
Leave this room.
How much more contempt must I tolerate?
It's bad enough that you've force yourself into a maiden's room.
Do you now wish to tear it apart?
Leave now.
I will not tolerate any more disrespect!
What are you doing here?
Lady Yun-hwa has a message for you.
For me?
You wish to go to the baron?
Do you know who you are up against?
The baron isn't your only opponent.
"Imperial Attendant Ju Tae-moon, Prime Minister Yoon Won-hyung, this could be a fight against the King who would shield them!"
One man has already lost his life.
I have no other choice.
This is the only way to save my friend's life.
They will not release him that easily no matter what you say.
"In fact, they will try to hurt you as well."
I can't back down.
You may be disqualified from the exam.
You may never get the chance to realize your cherished dream!
I know.
"Master, it's Kyun."
Enter!
Brothers...
- Thank you... for letting me sleep the night in jail.
"It was the most vile, most inhuman night of my life."
"Well, coming from the guy who married Julie Cooper, that's saying something."
"So, aside from coming up with your hilarious one-liners, what's our next move?"
My next move is to meet with the partners.
Make sure they agree to my taking you on as a client.
- Why wouldn't they?
- You're not exactly the ideal client.
"- What... rich, powerful?"
- Guilty.
- You missed the turn.
- I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten is meeting us at the house.
- I have a business to run.
- Who are you kidding?
"We both know, with the exception of the underhanded stuff, Kirsten does everything anyway."
Step down.
Put Kirsten in charge.
That's your next move.
Excuse me.
"- I'm new, um... is it all right to park here?"
"- Sure, if you're not embarrassed."
"- Ryan, what would you like?"
- You buying?
"No, but I'm letting you order first."
"I may be selfless, but I'm still pretty stingy."
"- Well, in that case,uh, let's see."
"Can I have a... what, what do you got?"
- Large coffee.
I just didn't want to keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.
"Iced coffee for me,please."
"Of all those smiling kids, how many are still smiling?"
"I mean, back then we just assumed that everything would work out."
"How many of us are going to end up in a good place, without messing it up along the way?"
"And I just felt really good, 'cause, like..."
I was one of the happy ones.
I had found Joanne.
And what do you do when you lose the person you were meant to be with?
"Just so I know, um..."
How long are you gonna wallow?
She left me an hour ago.
I was thinking maybe an hour and ten minutes?
"Dude, you have got to stop thinking about her as the person you were meant to be with."
"In fact, just stop thinking about her as a person."
"For a while, she is just that selfish, hurtful whore."
"Well, I'll give you selfish and hurtful."
"Oh, give me whore, too!"
Come on.
She just dumped you in front of 20 strangers at a party that you threw for her.
I think we can trade up.
I guess.
I just can't even imagine being with anyone else.
I know.
I do.
"It hurts, but..."
I have totally forgotten your name.
"I'm sorry I have to go, but I need to pick up my sister."
It's all right.
"We can, uh, do this again."
Really?
"Yeah, sure."
And not just for coffee.
"Next time, there may be pie."
"Hey, sharing is a virtue"
This is a world of efficiency
"Only those fast enough can live, stupid!"
Y es!
"Come, take some soup!"
Your leftover!
We've tasted every bone!
Now you can have the most original taste!
"Brother Jin, you must be hungry"
T ake this first
I don't feel like eating
"I'm sorry, I did want to bring you some food"
"But all those nasty brothers, they were so fast in clearing up all dishes, leaving you only this"
This one is untouched!
I really don't feel like eating
You're deeply hurt and haven't eaten for days
Your stomach will hurt.
"Come, for my sake"
"T ake this bowl of rice, come!"
I'll get you some tea
Your brothers fight for food?
They say this is a world of efficiency
Only those fast enough can live!
You must be the slow one!
"I'm the junior, they always bully me"
"Every meal I only have rice with soup, no food"
It's better than what I have now!
So original!
"Y es, that's called the original taste"
Rice has it's own taste!
Isn't it?
My Master said... your Kung Fu technique is stunning
- Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth,but it was never found."
All right.So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean war.
Something bad happened in Wonju...
schoolchildren killed by U.S.land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
********
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh,my God."
"On March 21,1963,Alcatraz officially closed."
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
"You're checking her for TBI,right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly,I barely bumped my head.Thanks."
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore,so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,Hastings and Sylvain their guns."
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean,maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
"-This is the spot, you say?"
-That's right!
This is your spot.
So what's the standard for finding the rock?
Standards?
The standards are a little...confusing.
"For example, if the standards for finding the rock is the size, then in that case, since Choong Sik is the biggest in this family, this would be Choong Sik."
Then your wife would be next...
Gil Da Ran...
And you.
Then...if the beauty is the standard for finding the rock...
Then...since this is the prettiest...
your wife.
"Then next would be Choong Sik, Gil Da Ran..."
And you.
See?
The standards for finding one is confusing.
Father-in-law...
So...
"With me being the ugliest and the smallest in the family, you have a problem with me being the biggest, and the prettiest rock."
"No, no, no, no!"
It's just that I was curious about what kind of a rock would represent me as a person.
The standards for finding your rock...
Is about harmony.
Fitting in harmoniously with the other rocks that are sitting up here.
Harmony!
We just need to find that.
Whether you want to find one or not...
You do whatever you want.
"Whenever adults don't want to bother explaining something, they always make things confusing and just fumble over it."
Harmony?
What's that?
One technician.
- Or every agent on this train dies.
- Okay.
You need to relax.
- We still have 20 minutes.
- Not any more.
I want it out now.
Right now!
Now!
- I don't know about this.
- It'll look better when it's covered.
- With what?
- Blood.
"Reid, do not take this vest off."
"In hostage situations,"
SWAT sometimes won't even tell the negotiator when they're deciding to go in.
Do you know why that is?
Because the slightest change in tone of voice or choice of words
- can give the whole thing away.
- That's right.
Don't make eye contact with Elle.
You're a technician.
You've never seen her before.
- Got it.
"- And remember, play into the guy's fantasy."
Believe it yourself.
"Actually, did you know that dentists and surgeons have been recruited to secretly implant these during otherwise normal medical procedures?"
This has been happening on and off since the late 1930s.
- Told me to believe.
- Let's go.
All right.
One government-issued microchip.
My childhood was a nightmare!
I've spent the rest of my life trying to board up that haunted house.
"Francis, this is important."
"I really need to remember something, and I don't know what it is."
- But...
- Please.
You're the only one who can help me.
My earliest memories...
It's kind of vague.
I remember we had that apartment...
I remember it being really colorful.
"Come on, Francis, honey."
"Please, won't you eat anything?"
"We've tried the carrots, and the peaches, and the oatmeal, the apples, huh?"
Don't you like anything?
Lois!
Would you like to know what your son did to my director's cut of The Eyes of Laura Mars?
He also shaved a hole in the carpet with my new Norelco!
"I'm sorry, Hal."
"I asked him very nicely not to play with it, but he just wouldn't listen."
I can't get him to do anything.
"I've read Dr. Spock and Piaget and Eisenberg, and The Language of Hugs, all these books, nothing's helping."
What he needs is a little discipline.
I think he'd behave better if he just ate something.
Look at him.
He's just wasting away.
I'm going to give him another Hershey bar.
"Lois, no!"
You can't keep coddling him like this!
I am sick and tired of always having to be the bad cop because you're constantly giving in to him.
"Okay, Hal, I'll try."
"You keep saying that, and then you do it again!"
You happy?
-I've seen it.
-Ah.
One last time.
You can think of some priest who fits the bill?
-Come on.
"-No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
All right.
-You know who I think really did it?
-Who?
The Dominicans.
Go pick on them.
"I could have you deported, you know that?"
I lied.
You look like Sal Mineo.
"It looks like a type of disorder that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures."
"We call it, uh, somnambular-form possession."
"Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded by some alien intelligence."
Um....
"A spirit, if you will."
"Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum."
"-Well, it's out of--"
-And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away.
"Well, I'm sorry."
You're sorry?
Jesus Christ!
"Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is...."
"Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure."
"But, um, I think of it as a shock treatment."
"As I said, it's a very outside chance--"
You risk everything if you don't act now.
If you want the vatican's righteous support
"For anything you do, for the rest of your life,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want France as an ally,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want to take England, you will need"
The next king of France by your side.
And you will wed
One of my sons tonight.
I will take my life in my own hands.
And I will not be bullied by you.
"Lady kenna requests a visit, your majesty."
No.
She requests that I inform you that she's naked under her robe.
Send her in.
It's nice to see you're still on your feet.
What does that mean?
I watched you
"Take it lying down for weeks now,"
From all the women in your life.
You don't like being bossed around
"By a girl, do you?"
Is this meant to arouse?
I was wrong to blame and demand things of you.
"I should have blamed you, absolutely."
I also should have offered you more of what you'd like
For what I'd like.
You're offering me sex for a husband?
I could get sex anywhere.
Not from me.
How little it would take for you
Nothing at all.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- [sickle] what're you doing?
- [Letha] thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas With Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us To penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
"Today my father will buy me a bike, and it will be prettier than yours!"
A bike?
Skidders are more fun than bikes!
They're no fun!
I don't want that!
"If you behave like this, I will not buy anything for you."
And your mother?
She went to the market to buy something.
You are a liar.
And that face?
It doesn't frighten me!
"Then throw it in the trash, if you don't want it."
I got upset because he is too egoistic.
I'm upset because papa did not buy me a bike.
"Then you were wrong, papa."
"You're good boy, don't cry."
How was I wrong?
You did not have to lie to the boy.
You don't know how much I wanted that bicycle for my son!
"Papa, you are a liar!"
You should speak with the director.
"Although I was in the right, it's normal that he dismissed me."
Be content with the skidder.
Who needs a bicycle anyway?
I didn't think that I would have to work at such a humble job.
"But you have a job, that is better than nothing."
Though I received a master's degree now I can't find work in the lowliest job.
It's all my fault.
I feel it.
"How lucky are the children, they can cry when they want."
A bear escaped from its cage!
"Although it escaped, our life remains in the same rut."
"But, look, if you don't get ahold of Alice and get the recipe, how you gonna sell this stuff?"
- What are you gonna do?
-Very simple.
The first thing I gotta do is get some financial backing.
"Now, tomorrow when I go to work, I walk right in to Mr. Marshall."
"Mr. Marshall, the president of your bus company?"
"Why, certainly."
He's a swell guy.
"Last year, for instance, there was some guy named, uh..."
"Herman Fatrack, and he had some kind of an invention."
"It was, uh, a wrench lock."
"Well, he took it in to Marshall, showed it to Marshall,"
"Marshall liked it, gave him some money and now he's got a whole factory going for himself."
Called Fatrack's Factory.
"Not bad, not bad, Ralph."
"But have you got an idea on how to present this, uh... this, uh, stuff here to your boss?"
I don't need any idea.
I'll do the same thing we did.
I'll let him taste it.
He'll be sold on it just like we were.
"Now, soon as he puts the money in my company and Alice knows that my boss has got money in this thing, she'll be proud to give me the recipe."
"Ralph Kramden, I got to take my hat off to you."
"Now, let's see."
We got to get some kind of a name for this.
Yeah.
How about this?
Kramden's Delicious...
"Now, wait, ho."
Wait a minute.
"What do you mean, ""Kramden's Delicious...""?"
Mr. Marshall is putting up the money for this thing.
You got to get his name in there someplace.
What happened?
- Is she dead?
- She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that.
I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
It is possible.
A lot that would need to change for that to happen.
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
Why don't you stay at your own apartment tonight?
"My apartment is sad and has improper heating, which you know because we're standing in it right now."
So you don't want to be trapped by academia.
There are some people over there who I wish I could still call my colleagues.
They didn't want this life for themselves.
I told this to our boy here.
"You know, you have to be very careful."
Don't believe too strongly the structures they put in front of you.
This is good advice.
"For you more so than him, though."
Excuse me.
(WHISTLES QUIETLY)
You seem ill equipped to deal with someone like that.
We began by hating one another.
I think we're coming back down the other side now.
That's a very potent image.
You should write it down and use it.
"I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here."
I'm glad you approve.
"Oh, I do, indeed."
I should go check on her.
Excuse me.
I think you're being rude to Ike.
I'm glad his feelings are so important.
I think I need to leave.
As you should be.
Yay!
"You know, the last time I was invited"
"To a ceremony in my honor, I had to slaughter a chicken."
"Well, at least you've been honored."
"I've-I've never been honored,"
"I did win a contest once at boarding school,"
"And I think there was a plaque,"
But I'm not sure that really counts.
What kind of contest?
It was for drinking hot chocolate
At the winter fair.
"I had a buddy that went to Exeter,"
And the stories he tells would make Keith Richards blush.
"Yeah, well, um..."
I wasn't really into the party scene.
I was there more for the academics.
"It sounds like you've made some great choices, Serena."
I'm glad.
The bad ones have a way of...
Following you.
"You know, I've never heard that hot chocolate story."
"Yeah, well, there are a lot of stories you haven't heard."
"True, but I did hear this one."
"My ex-boyfriend went to boarding school with Serena,"
And he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
At a bed-and-breakfast- Jenny.
Although I'm sure they were just studying.
"You know, like she says, she was all about the academics."
"I have an announcement, everyone."
I've decided I'm moving back in.
"That way, I can be here with you, mom."
The therapist.
What about her?
She's written her name in Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
Look.
Right here.
She did.
And this name...
Emile Sayles.
Same Handwriting.
"Looks like she signed him in, too."
Funny... she didn't mention that earlier.
"So, first, she treats the kid who committed suicide."
"Then a month later, she's at Kevin's funeral."
We got to find out what happened in those therapy sessions.
We got to go look at those files.
You want to get into the psychologist's confidential patient files off of a signature in a condolence book?
No.
"First, you look deeper into her and this Emile Sayles."
"Then we go to the judge, get a warrant, and then we go get her."
You understand?
Mm-hmm.
- Say you understand.
"- Don't... don't pull that ""say you understand"" thing with me."
That's... that's my thing.
"Well, don't you have a tank to get into or something?"
"""First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."""
"Yeah, right."
The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.
Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.
"What she was 12, this man..."
"Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does."
He pushed her until she broke.
And also a woman's hand is healing
You are not from here
Yes
I come from so far away
Then welcome my Paşa
I have got your cure
You are very strong
Will you stay a while?
I'd like to see you all the time my Paşa
"You never loved me, did you Victoria?"
"İbrahim, come here"
Are you okay?
Give your hand to me
Can you feel it?
Our son is very naughty
He turned again
Our son...
Don't condition yourself that it will be a son.
If it won't be a son you would be very sad
I did something when you were not here
What is it ?
I was weak when you were not here
I couldn't stand it
I met with astrologer Yakup Efendi
Why did you meet that faker?
He said that we will have a golden haired son
Golden haired...
Yes
I was relieved to hear that
Good then
But he said me one more thing
That there's a shadow that follows us
Reproductive Biology Research Foundation.
"Did you, uh, check on top of the fridge?"
I already looked there.
"Well, then maybe Helen finished the frosted flakes."
But that's what I eat for breakfast every day.
"Well, then fry an egg, then."
Just don't leave the refrigerator door hanging open.
"Oh, I got to go."
Are you-- are you hiding from me?
Hiding?
No.
That would just be silly.
Because I-I just saw you talking with Virginia.
I'm hiding from you because I do not want to have this conversation.
Why?
What did Virginia say?
"First of all, there is nothing going on between her and Logan."
She said that?
"Well, of course she said that now."
"But what if you were to take her out for dinner, you know?"
- Maybe have a drink or two?
- No!
"My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them."
"Hey, hey."
Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.
"Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever."
The only person you can control is yourself.
"So, you got no relevant information out of her"
- about Logan.
"- Oh, for the love of God!"
Are you kidding me?
The placebo reaction.
"Oh, yes"
"Yes, grown up just like you"
I wonder if we'll meet again
Don't think too much
Go and get some medicine as per this prescription at Butterfly Valley
"Yes, guardian"
"Don't move, where is wu Ching Niu?"
what do you want with him?
"Never mind, just tell me"
"what, you're a girl?"
what are you up to anyway?
Disguised as a girl and looking for wu
My mother has been injured and I need Doctor wu where's your mom?
Mom
Mom
"Mom, how are you?"
How come you've been hurt so badly
Do you know where wu Ching Niu is?
Of course I do but he doesn't treat outsiders
I know
You're from the school of Ming Cult
You could say that because my name is Ji Shiau Fu
Then you are the heroine of Er Mei who gave birth to a daughter with Yang Siu ...1 8 years ago
Ashamedly yes
"Please Sit, wu Ji, fetch the medicine"
Yes
Doctor wu I haven't come here for treatment but have a favour to ask
what is it?
Since she's Left Guardian of Ming cult's daughter...
I was hoping you could deliver her to her father ...after I die
"Mother, you won't die..."
"Heroine Ji, what's your story with Guardian Yang?"
Vampires.
I do envy true believers.
I do.
I wish I could get out of my brain and... experience a real...
Spiritual ecstasy or...
That's what Tequila's for.
You really feel that way?
I do.
I would love to feel God's presence.
"Ah, so you admit the possibility that God exists."
"Well, it can't be proved, but it can't be disproved, either."
"So, therefore, I..."
I think God may exist.
"This is the last of the cinnamon, by the way."
I'll pick you up some tomorrow.
Thank you.
"See, this... this may be proof that God exists."
Must have cinnamon with with Will's special hot chocolate.
"Not work, I hope."
"No, it's Esme."
I gave her a jacket today to impress a boy.
"""Jacket worked."
We hung out after school.
"Miles is awesome."""
I'd forgotten how macabre this office is.
"Well, under the circumstances, the decor seems appropriate."
"Well, you know, I'm just one of those guys."
I'm not...
I am simply not afraid of death.
I don't know why.
"I see it as either a beautiful release or a start of a great, unknown adventure."
That's easy for you to say.

"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."

"... andI finallyfoundaplace,where  you can make a difference."
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We gotta keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
"I gotta get that report, see where it leads."
"What if, while you're playing detective..."
... Wakeleydecides it'd be healthier to disappear?
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we gotta take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own...
... you'llfeelthefullweight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
It was nice.
"You know, my contract's up pretty soon."
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
- You're gonna be late.
- It's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
- I don't.
Love you!
And you!
"In polite society,"
One telephones ahead before trespassing.
I imagine strange women traipsing through the property
Isn't a completely unusual occurrence.
That's a fair point.
What brings you here?
My landlady gave me an idea.
"Why, now if we could get an opinion from your butcher..."
Someone robbed howard's impenetrable vault.
"If I can find out how he got in,"
Perhaps I can trace where he went
And locate howard's missing technology.
"You're not really dressed for it, I'm afraid."
Our thief didn't exactly walk the items out of the front door.
"The night of the break-in, did you hear anything?"
There was a tremendous thunderstorm.
"It knocked the power out, including the alarms,"
For almost two hours.
Not that I would have heard any of it.
I'm afraid the sultry combination
Of candlelight and rain always puts me out like a baby.
Hmm.
You're quite the guard dog.
Security is not within my purview.
Sousa:
Ssr.
Open up.
Unbelievable.
A known fugitive isn't answering his door.
Knock harder.
"That must have been a few million won, at least."
Where did you get the money?
You know that I'm working for Yong Moon Plan now.
You just started.
- Did you rob them?
- I didn't!
"Bro, you're hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Take off your uniform too.
It's a piece of evidence.
How is this evidence?
I got blood on me from trying to save him!
Son of a...
"Hello, sir."
I just got a call from the head of the Sung Jang Police Station.
"Do you remember Lawyer Jo Eun Jung, who was reported missing?"
"Yes, he's the last person to have seen Seo Jun Suk before his death."
"He has been discovered, as a corpse."
Is that so?
"But, the thing is..."
in his pants pocket... was Im Tae Ho's business card.
"For the time being, you won't be leaving this building."
Listen carefully!
If it becomes news that an active officer has been on a serial killing spree the entire country will be upside down.
Mr. President.
What are you talking about?
"What do you mean, a serial killing spree?"
Take extra precaution to make sure nothing leaks to reporters!
- Understand?
- Without even investigating...
How can you accuse me like this?
That's why...
I will... interrogate you myself.
"No, it's not possible."
George is gonna kill me and so is Jim Jarmusch.
"Well, they can't both kill you."
Just call the dad and ask for it.
He will shoot me.
She's only 16 years old...
"Well, nearly 17."
Nearly 17.
"- You didn't sodomize her, did you?"
- No.
That's too bad.
You gotta be careful.
A lot of things fall under sodomy.
I wonder if kissing is sodomy.
Don't say that.
I need to get this screenplay.
I'm supposed to call Jarmusch and tell him what I think.
Ignore it.
Don't answer your phone.
That's what I would do.
But I don't want it to blow over.
I want this.
I can't work on my novel.
I need this job.
You let me know.
"Because what happened to me was, talking to you before, kind of stirred me up a little bit."
"Yeah, it did."
"And I realised that, you know, my opinions aren't generally taken into consideration."
"That's because in my line of activity, the attributes of loyalty are so much more important than your attributes of opinions."
"Cos, a bodyguard..."
What does a bodyguard do?
"He's gotta stay close to his subject at all times, all the time, and you're wondering what am I doing here right now, right?"
"Trust me, give all yours to him, you'll be safe."
"I don't know about others but I feel like seeing the thief once, only then I can be happy."
"You'll definitely see him sir, you've seen me, haven't you sir?"
You've seen him!
"From now onwards, I'll give the kick of life for all of you."
"Previously on ""Being Erica""..."
Is it true that you're taking Friedken's book from Julianne?
"Julianne's ship is taking on water, fast."
She gave me my shot.
"She's a friend, and I'm not just gonna abandon her."
"I'm disappointed in you, Erica."
The feeling's mutual.
That girl is my daughter.
I don't feel like you want me to have a life.
"We had a fight this day, and it was one of many, but this day I said some things that I later regretted."
You're hurting me!
And this was the last time that I saw my daughter.
"I mean, I didn't know if she was dead or alive... and I still don't."
So... you sing really well.
"You're like a barista by day, a rock star by night."
"I do have feelings for you, Kai."
"I wish that I didn't, but I do."
"Relationships-- they're like pillars in our lives, providing support, defining the space in which we live."
Good morning.
"Hey, you."
Is everything ok?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Why?
"You know, you're the worst liar on the planet."
Uhh...
Excellent.
"You look relieved, Father."
That was the toughest yet.
Thanks for the steer.
"Anything for a peaceful life, eh?"
Partners in crime.
Who'd have thought it?
"You know what, when those two get together, they really are a deadly combination."
Of course the real reason we won is because I knew exactly which blooms Father Brown favoured.
What rot!
"If I hadn't been to finishing school, the whole thing would have been an unmitigated disaster!"
"Excuse me, we're looking for the deli counter."
Certainly.
Turn left at Lighting and it's just past Ladies Wear.
"Nice one, ta."
We should leave.
People are giving us some pretty dirty looks.
"No, we fit right in, man!"
"Sure, we might not be cash rich, but it's obvious we're classy guys."
"Here we go, the taster counter."
"Get stuck in, it's free."
"Yep, really classy."
"If you load up, you can taste a full meal."
"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
"We're just browsing, thanks."
And eating.
I'm browsing with my mouth.
Just having a little taste - try before you buy.
And are you planning to buy that chicken leg?
"Probably not now, to be honest."
We're sorry about this.
You're not the only one who worries about a tsunami.
Why don't you come with us?
"We'll just hike the lower ridge, grab some lunch; it'll be fun."
"Because it'll be just like we're dating, but we're not,so,no."
"I like how you'll take me to your sister's wedding, but you won't go for a hike with me."
"I like how you'll live with me for three years, but you won't marry me."
"Oh,see?"
Hike's ruined.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you guys.
Later.
"Just so you know, when Elliott showed up,I think your mole moved."
"Seriously,it's like twitched a line bit."
Skin Nugget thinks Elliott's the one.
He doesn't want to be the one.
Hey.
"We didn't really get a chance to catch up the other night,so..."
"Is there something that you want from me,Bella?"
"I thought maybe we could grab a drink, but if you're not into it..."
"""Into it""?"
"Yeah,you know what?"
I could be into it.
I could also just... want revenge.
"You know,like,big, classic John Hughes cinematic movie revenge."
But you could also be into it?
See?
Like right there.
"I mean,just for,like,a nanosecond,"
"I'm thinking,wow,she is so adorable"
I want to just die.
And then I just want to throw eggs at you.
But rather than boring you with my résumé...
I'd rather answer your questions on specific issues of foreign policy.
"I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw, how you'd feel in the same situation."
Why would I answer that for you?
Sorry.
It's simply a privacy issue.
"Look, I won't address issues of sexuality in a hearing room... or on national television or anywhere else for that matter."
- Where's the control room for America Live?
I'm so proud of you.
I've been boasting to the forest fairies I'm marrying a devil who works and they're so envious they stopped talking to me.
"If you wanna get married, find somebody else."
I'm too busy for such tomfoolery.
Who?
There's no other young spook around!
"That one, that one at the mansion, marry the Duke, he's a fine spook."
The one from Netolice?
"No, wait..."
"Jean, bring me a window, I want to look in the garden."
Now you know?
"Come quickly, sit down."
Now watch!
"There we are, your Grace."
A fine red wine.
Delicious.
I can't see!
The mirror!
It's gone!
But there's plenty more where that came from.
Jean.
You licked off the cream!
"Your Grace, how can you..."
This is yummy.
Go.
"We could be spotted if we move together, so let's say our goodbyes here."
Be careful.
You must be out of the city before dawn.
Brothers...
Be careful.
This is it.
This is my last good turn as a friend.
I'm alone from now on.
I have no friends of any kind.
We will go our separate ways.
So don't resent me...
I will gladly accept any punishment if you withdraw your order to abolish the navy!
I will end my life here if you so desire!
You are continue your attempt to break me?
Must I take your life with my own hands before you submit?
Very well.
Consider your wish granted.
"No, Your Majesty!"
You cannot punish a subject by death for being forthright!
Do not interfere!
Please withdraw your sword!
Step aside!
Strike me instead!
This man has spent every waking moment of the day for a year protecting the southern front!
"If you forsake this faithful man, I, too, cannot observe your wishes!"
"Your Majesty, I beg you to strike me instead!"
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty!
Father nearly killed Yi Soon-shin and Minister Yu Sung-ryong?
"Yes, Your Highness."
His skull would have had to go right through the table.
The body is in the wrong position.
Was that tape torn?
I'm sure this is important.
But why?
"Because if I'm the killer and I want to get a dead body off my table,"
I'd cut the tape.
BRENNAN:
It was torn.
Which suggests Aldo tried to break free.
So perhaps he was killed somewhere else.
"They're at the sound studio, combing through the wreckage."
What's left?
"What's left is you could fit into a beer can, that's what's left."
So we're back where we started.
Who is this guy?
And why did he target Aldo Clemens?
Yeah. (phone ringing) Hold on.
(Booth groans)
(phone beeps) Yeah?
There's one possible explanation for how Aldo died.
"Well, look, does it get us any closer to finding out who killed him?"
"Well, let me show you what we have."
"All right, hold on."
What do you got?
(sighs)
BRENNAN:
"From the position of the body and the fractures, the killer couldn't have snapped Aldo's neck while he was restrained."
So what's left?
SAROYAN:
The most likely explanation is that Aldo killed himself.
"He was fastened to the table by duct tape, but he managed to loosen it."
I didn't see you.
"You know, an interesting thing happened to me yesterday."
I found a Syrian spy at a restaurant in downtown Miami.
Wow.
"That must be some catch, huh?"
"Actually, it was more like a consolation prize."
I had heard somewhere that your son might be there.
Really?
Well...guess you can't believe everything you hear.
"Let's stop pretending, shall we?"
Next time you see your son -- and we both know there will be a next time -- you tell him I'm coming for him.
"And if you keep helping him, I'm coming for you, too."
So...
How soon can we leave?
"Well, that depends."
"Schmidt, if you can't do this --"
"I can do it, all right?"
Of course I can do it.
But the terms of the arrangement may have changed.
No.
The deal was we get rid of Jabbar in exchange for an all-expenses-paid trip to wherever we want to go.
Your words.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was before I knew that your plan involved
Jabbar stealing everything I have left.
So you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
How much?
Depends on where you want to go.
Depends on how many of you want to go.
"I mean, I-I-I-it's you two, uh, it's black George Clooney, guy with the chin..."
Right -- the four of us.
No.
"It was so Dr. Cicchirini, I do not know..."
"I already am in charge, yes, yes."
I already am in charge.
"Good night, Mr. Benito, where he has gone of party tonight?"
"To where she wants that she goes, lady?"
"That way, with the friendly."
"Ah, I know very well the youth of nowadays."
"Friendly, friendly, small orgy..."
"It hears, by the one of the rent, still I am waiting for the heel of my aunt."
She is really his aunt?
Because the handsome boys always find some arranged to pay by them.
My aunt has 70 years and it pays for the studies to me until the Medicine doctorate ever since a doctor discovered that he suffers 14 diseases and it makes happy giving a pile him of medecines.
I know it.
Already there is it to me counted.
"But although not outside her aunt, would not be anything bad."
Because a true woman knows to give itself and in the bed it is not like the children of nowadays.
I in the bed give everything it.
One is bad?
The belly hurts much to me.
-It wants that it does a massage to him?
-No. no.
"Hungry of love, it was observing to me..."
-Who is?
-I am Italia.
Step inside.
"Professor, is everything to point for the operation."
"Italy, Italia."
"They see this, see here."
Closer.
Professor the operation.
"They see, Italia, Country of saints and poets..."
"Barney, come with me."
Boys!
- Leave him alone.
"- You stay out of this, Michael Coyne!"
We're doing the job for you.
Maybe now the Yanks will leave our women alone.
Get away from him.
"Michael doesn't keep that gun loaded, Mrs. Coyne."
He told me often enough.
"Do you want to test that theory, Michael Hanlon?"
Rose.
Get away from him!
Cowards!
HE COUGHS
"Mr. Coyne, in light of what just happened, the Commanding Officer has placed your bar out of bounds for a period of two months."
Two months?
"He wanted to put it out of bounds, period."
- I had to argue very hard.
- Thank you.
Do you mind?
The Commanding Officer also wanted me to ask if Lieutenant Barnhill gave a good account of himself?
- He did.
- Good.
Good.
"We expect our fellows to give as good as they get, and apparently Lieutenant Barnhill is the current Kentucky golden gloves champion."
"That said, I want to say thank you for stepping in to save him."
"Now, Mrs. Coyne, I think it's more important than ever that we try to understand how to avoid things like last night."
I would very much appreciate the benefit of your local knowledge.
Rose is about as local as Winston Churchill.
But you're right.
She does seem to be able to make better sense of things in this parish than I do.
"I have to go, Captain."
Let me tell you that this is one of the worst days of my life.
Remember how I told you Minx's best friend was the light?
"Well, now I realise I was wrong."
Bonnie was my best friend.
Bonnie.
I saw that crystal clear today when I went to the airport to pick up her parents.
It was a good photo opportunity for Minx.
"So she went, even though it was very early."
"You didn't laugh at my little joke against Minx, Michelangelo."
Maybe you don't have a sense of humour.
"Anyway, her family are fat."
They're all fat and small.
Her little sister looks like a sausage.
Look over there.
But they loved Bonnie.
They loved her.
"Nursed her through the operations, the eyes, the nose, everything."
Worked night and day to pay for it all.
And now she's gone.
All for nothing!
The detective asks me how I feel about my models.
"I told him again and again, I adore them."
"Of course, Michelangelo!"
They wear my designs!
"OK, OK, Dorothy was, I must admit, tiring."
It was the tears like a fountain.
"And Bonnie was, I admit, a nightmare, but in the show, you see, she was a winner."
"She could walk, you see."
"And then there was the hair, red, which was, in my opinion, overrated."
"That's why I put her in a wig but not just any wig, you understand."
"A 30-metre long black braid, Chinese reference."
"It was superb, truly superb."
That is one thing that has gone right today.
"My name is Michael, and I'm here to help you."
"- Everything all right in there, Michael?"
- What is she doing?
She'll wait for us to make a move and pick us off when we do.
I need a screwdriver.
Shouldn't we call the park rangers?
"Unless the park rangers have been issued body armor... and high-caliber weapons, we're on our own here."
She must have disabled my gun when we stopped for gas.
Remove the trigger bar spring from a SIG Sauer P228... and you've got a nine-millimeter semiautomatic doorstop.
"I don't know what you think you're playing at, but this is not a game you can win."
"Doug, I need a paper clip."
Got one?
I don't have a paper clip.
"Well, do you have something like a paper clip,a thin piece of metal-"
Wait.
Never mind.
Kill him yourself if you want.
- We need to wrap this thing up.
- Oh.
Fiona.
- You fix it?
- Hardly.
I might get one shot off.
- You got one chance to shoot her?
- I'm not gonna shoot her.
- Wait.
- Is she leaving?
I seriously doubt that.
You have any duct tape?
Hold that there.
"When I say ""now,"" you're gonna open that door."
The promise of the Chinese ambassador post is pulling you away like you no longer work here.
The DCI has put me on the trilateral commission looking into Jai's death.
People think I murdered my own son?
Hey.
"For a week trip, you pack kind of light."
Please tell me you're not wearing this.
I'm going on a business trip to the Caribbean.
"Unless you're applying for a job at Sandals,"
I would lose this shirt.
What kind of business do you have in the Caribbean?
"Oh, I have my finger in a number of..."
Pies.
Pies.
"Yeah, I know."
"What kind of pies, specifically?"
"Apple, rhubarb... cherry, when I'm in the mood."
This is always the worst part.
The fashion tips?
The end.
"We're always saying good-bye, and we never know when we're gonna see each other again."
Come with me... on my trip-- a week together in paradise.
You have to work.
I don't want to interfere.
"Well, I've never had a problem mixing business and pleasure."
Have you?
I do have some vacation time saved up and... a bikini I've been dying to wear.
Or not wear.
"Where are you going-- Bahamas, Caymans?"
Cuba.
Still interested?
When do we leave?
Hey.
"Hey, look."
It's Yo-Yo.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
"Hey, Yo-Yo."
Don't you want to catch us?
I don't trust him.
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.
Come on.
"Hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?"
It's not my job anymore.
They're coming down to fire me for destroying city property.
The only thing that works is the radio.
And it won't turn off.
"I was only trying to help you, kids."
"Mr. Yokomoto,"
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
"All I ever wanted in life was all you kids that I put back in school, someday visit me and say,"
"""thanks Mr. Yo-Yo, Yokomoto."
"If it wasn't for you forcing us to get an education,"
"We would've been bums."""
That's all I wanted.
You see?
I told you he was gonna hit us with some of that heavy psychology.
"I mean, I feel guilty."
Bulletin from the plutonium plant.
"Unless the demands of the terrorists are met, the furnace will explode with the force of ten megatons."
"An official describes the atomic furnace controls as frozen in position,"
"- As if ""the molecular flow..."""
- That's Tony!
- The plant is being evacuated.
- That's where he is!
Bring her in.
- You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't we just all go for a walk?
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
"""Athletic."" Sideburns, no cans."
- She is hot.
"- So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in... in six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
- Twenty and a half.
- Almost.
"Hold up, guys."
She had to bounce.
Um...
Flash mob broke out in front of a line... of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg.
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form of transportation.
She's roller-skating there.
"Yeah, I don't know which is more pathetic..."
That you're going out with a 20-year-old... or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out, catching up..."
- on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping...
- Oh.
And she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."
"I don't want this to sound too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me."
"Uh, until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser."
"Just kidding, just kidding."
"The kid is sick, and a child's life will never come back once it's gone."
Child?
Whose child?
His child.
What about his wife?
She's not well and can't work.
Is that why you have to work as a stripper?
I can't understand how he could make you work for his child like that.
It's not for him.
I want to do it.
"People are going on and on about ""freedom"" these days, but I think I should have the freedom to give up my freedom to someone else."
Tomoko?
Good morning.
I was wondering where you were.
told me.
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you.
This is for you.
"Sensei, I can't take that."
"Ah, I hear Pertolucci."
I think Shinako is dancing.
It must be because I was talking about some really unpleasant things last night.
"Sensei, I'm going to dance my last ballet."
What an irritating racket for so early in the morning!
Is Shinako dancing?
"Yes, with Tomoko."
"Did you know that while you're dancing to Pertolucci, this is the anniversary of Nijinsky's death?"
"Yes, he died in a hospital in London last spring."
He went crazy and died.
You could say that he was a victim of the war.
"When he started to lose it, he was talking about ""Russia"" and ""War""."
"Well, Nijinsky was a pacifist, a follower of Tolstoy."
You're lost on this e?
Puzzled.
"They barely knew finn, yet they let him move in,loaned him money."
They trusted a man who took advantage of them.
"If you're in a relationship and the other person is keeping secrets, how would you know?"
You'd know.
I didn'T.
Who lied to you?
You did.
"Not exactly lied,but you just didn't tell me the whole truth either."
You're comparing me to finn?
I'm just saying that you can be involved with someone without fully knowing them.
How could you not tell me about your family?
Finish your e-mail.
You wanted my advice.
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.
Finn duped them.
And I shouldn't have brought up the past.
I know you had your reasons for not wanting to tk about it.
We're talking about it now.
Now is not paris.
Your priorities were clear on paris.
I had a job to do in europe.
"If I had told you about my first wife, would it have made a difference?"
"We'll never know,will we?"
yeah.Gibbs.
You went home early.
Stayed until 2130.
That's early for you.
"You called to talk about my work hours, Dr. Mallard?"
"No,agent gibbs."
I had a hunch which led me to trim lance corporal finn's nose hairs.
Come on outside with me and let blanche finish dressing.
-I'm finished dressing.
-Then come on out.
-Your sister and I are having a talk.
-Honey run to the drugstore and get me a lemon Coke with chipped ice.
"will you do that for me, sweetie, please?"
please.
AII right.
Poor thing was out there listening to us.
And I have an idea she doesn't understand you as well as I do.
"AII right now, Mr. KowaIski, Iet us proceed without any more digression."
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.
What is it?
In the state of Louisiana we got here what's known as the napoleonic Code.
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa."
"My, but you have an impressive judicial air."
"You know, if I didn't know that you was my wife's sister, I would get ideas about you."
-Such as what?
-Don't play so dumb.
You know what.
AII right.
Cards on the table.
I know I fib a good deal.
"After all, a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion."
But when a thing is important I tell the truth.
And this is the truth:
"I never cheated my sister, or you, or anyone else on earth as long as I lived."
"-Where are the papers, in your trunk?"
-Everything I own is in that trunk.
What are you thinking of?
What's in the back of that little boy's mind of yours?
Please come in.
Miss Dashwood.
"Miss Marianne, it is both an honour and the greatest of pleasures to see you."
- I shall leave you for a little while.
- I am sure the Colonel would have you stay.
"Excuse me, I have much to do downstairs."
"Do please sit down, Colonel."
Thank you.
"Dear Colonel Brandon, I must convey my sincere gratitude for all that you..."
"Oh, let us leave that as said."
Excuse me.
I interrupted rudely.
I am embarrassed at being thanked for what was a privilege.
I only caught a glimpse of you the other night.
You're looking so much better.
You must be looking forward to going home to Barton.
"Yes, it seems a lifetime ago that we left for London."
Take things very quietly when you get back.
- Promise me.
"- I am grateful for your concern, Colonel."
Be assured I intend to do little but sit in the garden and read.
"Ah, Gothic novels, with their ghosts and ruined castles."
- Why not?
- I play the schoolmaster.
You read Cowper and Scott.
"You have heard of them, have you?"
I have studied them a little.
I think them truly wonderful.
"Oh, indeed they are great poets."
But have you not read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare?
"""Fear no more the heat of the sun"
"""Nor the furious winter's rages"
I have to talk to you.
I'm in trouble.
My wife arrives tomorrow.
Aren't you happy?
"Sure, but I lied to her about my Iife here."
"I tried to tell herthe truth, but she didn't believe me, so I let herbeIieve what she wanted."
I told herit's awful here.
"The more she thinks I'm suffering, the nicer she treats me, ourreIationship has improved and she's better."
I'm not sure I got it.
She's betterif you're worse?
"It sounds strange, but that's it."
What did you tell her?
.
I didn't get that.
"Stereotypes, more orless."
Untrue things they say up North.
Like you're somewhat basic.
"SimpIetons, dull, that you gesture, you can't be understood, you're a bit vulgar."
"Maybe I used the terms dirty, violent, shitkickers."
- Shitkickers?
- I did it forIove.
ForherI was a hero facing life courageously.
Don't abandon me.
I didn't even want to come here.
I was sent because I faked being handicapped!
"My friends, I did it forher!"
"His book is on the night table, he's at page 11, he has to reach page 26, then he can sleep."
He has to brush his teeth for at Ieast one minute.
"That's the humidifier, and not too much perfume, it dries the boy's mucous membranes, he'II lose his sense of smell, as an adult he won't smell a gas leak."
I'II go get the bag of medicines.
"Mommy, I'm scared of Grandma and Grandpa!"
What's this smell?
And you always wear the most beautiful vintage dresses that remind me of my abuelita.
"And I have a girlfriend, but if I didn't, I would want to sleep with you."
Thank you.
"How you doing, Pop?"
Doing all right in there?
I don't know.
"Obviously not doing too good, I guess."
"Oh, I brought the racing form."
I thought you might like to know the results from Arlington.
"Um, so tit-for-tat won in the sixth."
I'm skipping the early races 'cause you said that those were all for the amateurs.
"Nothing but nags running, right, Dad?"
Painted lady took the seventh.
"Won 24 bucks, that's sweet."
I got to think that you would've put some money on her 'cause you always liked the ladies.
Hungry heart only paid out 4 bucks in the eighth.
Probably 'cause it's a favorite.
"Who bets on a favorite, huh?"
What fun is that?
"Uh, that's all I got."
I'll bring more results tomorrow.
There's a big stakes race.
I figure you'd have blown a shitload of money on that.
I don't know what else to say.
Kinda weird talking to someone if you don't even know if they can even hear you.
You know?
"I'm just gonna sit here for a bit, and I don't think I'm probably gonna say anything at all, cool?"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I didn't mean to intrude.
I'll come back in a bit.
Thanks.
"Decaf, right?"
I got a text from my daughter last night.
Chivonne?
I guess her auntie finally told her I was out.
She wants to see me.
What'd you tell her?
I told her yes.
"Okay, Doc, you can say it."
"Look, I know that she's the reason why you're doing this, that you want to be someone that she can look up to."
But seeing her right now could be really dangerous for both of you.
"I know, but she asked to see me."
"After all this time, she came to me."
"If I turn her down, I might not get a second chance."
Just be careful.
Always.
"Hello, olá, and Eoh, wasseo, gamers and gamerettes."
It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City with your daily dose of...
(imitates explosion) knowledge.
"Today I'm gonna introduce you to the newest champion for Skystrike Titans, Vadrus Typhon."
"He is a complete badass, which is why all you rug rats are gonna pay big bucks for this upgrade, so you can do this... (laughs)"
"""But how do I execute that combo?"" you ask..."
"Okay, admit it, this guy's hilarious."
He's old.
"He's got to be, like, 30."
"Yeah, but, like, that's the whole point."
"He's been playing forever, so he knows all the tricks."
He's gonna be at the VGU Open this weekend.
I'm gonna play him.
I'm gonna kick his ass.
I can't believe you're wasting an entire weekend playing video games with sweaty nerdcore dweebs.
Not all of them are dweebs.
"Challenge Uncle O.G., but be warned-- you will be wrecked."
There will be pwnage.
"We have a huge viral campaign push with cell phone cross promotion, playable demos that can be e-mailed with an embedded link to the site."
"We even posted game samples on Youtube, pointing towards the pre-purchase 10-day trial link"
- Brian.
- All right.
"I just wanted to add that Dave and I are scheduled to be on ""Game Gab"" tomorrow."
"Oh, that's great."
Half a million hits per day.
"Um, and where are we with your deal?"
"We haven't heard from your lawyer, Adam Hillman."
Right.
Uh... we're on it.
What about the bugs in the game?
"Dave, how are we doing on the bug thing?"
Dave?
The level three bugs?
It's bug.
Singular.
"It means, uh, it's all being resolved."
- We'll be ready for the duplicators
- Without a doubt?
We--we--just I.M.Ing the guys at the--at the shop.
It's gonna be fine.
It's all under control.
"""All under control""?"
That's the best you got?
It's a glitch in the code.
We'll figure it out.
"It could tank the whole game, Dave."
"Yeah, kinda like the fact that we don't have a signed contract which we would have if you actually talked to Adam instead of sticking his face under the sofa."
"Well, he started it."
"""He started it""?"
"What are you, 12?"
"Yes, Operation Sunshine, the protection of power and dam installations in Southern Norway, to prevent the Germans from destroying too much before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation with Parson as second in command and Skinnarland on radio duties.
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
Congratulations.
I thought this was what you always wanted.
"To go back to Norway, get out into the field again?"
"If you'd rather stay here just until the end of hostilities and then go and see your wife and children, it's no problem, I can..."
Of course not.
The war's not over yet.
"Thank you, sir."
Good man.
"Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get fishes like this in Norway.
"Not really, no."
Eugh!
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss the most about Norway?
"The horizons, wherever you look."
Yeah.
It's been a while.
You must come and visit.
My house is big.
"Well, that could be awkward."
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good bird-watchers.
It certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have a war.
Yes.
What else to it?
You know why?
"'Cause the one day-- the one goddamn day that your department, that your crew, that your goddamn country needed you the most, you froze up like a goddamn needle-ass little dick."
Anybody else want some?
"You're all right, you're all right."
It's all right.
It's all right.Get up.
I wish you boys could learn to get along.
Jeez.
"When we were riding down in the rig that morning,"
I think we were figuring out what we were gonna do.
"I was ok, so was he."
"Getting off the rig, fine."
"Going in, going up, coming out, the first couple of saves, all good."
Even as the building... was coming down.
"The rumble, all instinct."
"Run, roll, cover, fine."
"But after... rubbed all that shit out of my eyes, out of my ears, couldn't see anything, couldn't hear anything."
"You never told us what to do after, did you?"
"Running up the beach on d-day, huh?"
"Guys on the left of you, the right of you getting their heads blown off."
You kept running up the beach.
Hitler's holy hell.
"We heard all about that, right?"
D-day.
The marching to berlin.
Goddamn concentration camps.
"Going in, freeing everybody up."
We heard all about that.
Goddamn hero.
Goddamn decorated hero.
What were we supposed to do after?
You never told us what you did after.
- Crusoe.
Robinson crusoe.
"stay right there, mr."
Crusoe.
Don't move an inch.
Why?
I said don't move!
You expect me to stand here while you try and shoot me?
So you can keep your secret and carry on living a lie?
Only so I can carry on living.
"Listen, I wish you no harm."
Then why were you spying on me.
I wasn't spying on you.
"I came to ask for your help, but you--"
This changes things.
I'm sorry I startled you.
"If you're in need of medical help, then my sex would be of no issue."
Are you planning something?
"Like I said, this changes things."
You don't trust me because I'm a woman?
I serve jacob moore because I'd be killed if I didn'T.
I do what I can for captain taylor because I have no wish to end up on the end of a rope should he regain command.
Self-preservation to the last.
"You're a castaway stranded on this island, mr."
Crusoe.
We're all slaves to self-preservation.
Takes courage to live as I do.
More than if I were a man.
I'll find another way.
What if I tell the mutineers you're out here?
And what if I tell them that you're a woman?
Whose life would become more unbearable then?
"Yes, we loved each other so much, do you know why we split up?"
"No need to know reason for split up, there's good feeling in what you said now."
Let it continue.
You must hear why we split up.
Leave it.
"No, please listen to me."
"After hearing whatever you said,"
"I don't know if it's true or false,"
"I liked your character in it, I love you."
He gave a reverse twist.
"You were right sir, a Chennai jeweller made two such pieces, records show it was sold to two people."
Who are they?
What are their details?
"One buyer was our DGP, another buyer was a girl."
Shop has a photo of hers.
Girl?
They don't have other details but have a delivery address.
Go there immediately and find who is she.
He hasn't called even once after going there.
Can't he work here?
Why does he have to go to Malaysia?
"You always criticized when he leftjobs, now he's working sincerely, let him do it."
Is Swathi at home?
Swathi?
Nobody lives here with that name.
This girl.
Who is she?
They give this address only.
"We are living here for the past 7 years, not only here, I've not seen her in this area also."
Why did you say you don't know her?
She rejected my son.
She had promised to be with him always.
I would've expressed my love for you...
Still I'm found at fault...
Is that my mistake?
"When you come after me, I feel angry..."
"When I don't see you around, I go mad about you..."
My heart rages in fire...
Time has no medicine to cure my heart...
"You fight with your conscious everyday, dear..."
What will your arrogance achieve?
Nothing wrong to accept your love...
"Stop fighting, sweetheart..."
Don't you like my arrogance?
"Daddy, I want to talk you urgently."
I'm in an important meeting.
Talk to me later.
No dad.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
They have come there on an official visit.
The clue 'LOSER' was given to me on November 9th.
Ministers Malaysia programme got confirmed on November 8th.
"So, he already knew about Ministers programme."
There is some link between their programme  his plan.
What are these Ministers doing in Malaysia?
Ministers are planning something unofficial here.
"Banerjee, we earned 300 crores cheating people  doing all the wrong deeds."
We struggled had to turn this money into dollars.
Your 300 crores is the first investment for the hotels we are going to start.
Big money will change hands.
He has come here to rob that money.
"If he had come here months before, he must've planned it well."
He must've planned a game.
There is a link between Ministers  my uncle.
"He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth."
Xerxes was reborn a god.
Artemisia trusted no one.
So in the cover of night the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies.
All those he trusted
mall those who had raised him
mall those he had once looked to for counse were quickly introduced to her wrath.
And as the god-king stood before his people
Artemisia watched her ﬂawless manipulation take shape.
- For glory's sake
- For glory's sake
- for vengeance's sake - for vengeance's sake war.
war!
War is coming to Greece in the visage of a monster army over a million strong.
It should be little more than a formality for Themistokles the hero of Marathon to finish what he began.
Please!
We must appeal to Xerxes' reason!
Coward!
Athens is a city of cowards!
Shut your cock hole!
Shut your own!
I'll kill you!
Fuck the Spartans!
Fuck those muscle-bound boy-lovers!
Silence!
Silence for the hero of Marathon!
"This is a democracy, not a street fight."
Quiet!
It's Themistokles.
The Persian attack will come from both the north and the south.
The city-states should negotiate a truce.
"Yes, yes, we must negotiate."
Saira...
You stay here.
No!
Why did you target my prey?
Because Saiba was confronting a tiger with a dagger.
"The tiger didn't even have a dagger, Kaabir."
It's my duty to protect Saiba.
Paathar belongs to me.
You have to either drown or fly to reach here.
I don't want anyone's help.
It's beautiful.
I fear someone might cast an evil eye.
Kaabir... there's news that Muraaki Jilaan has set his eyes on our Paathar.
Jilaan?
"Muwaqqit, we wish to conquer the world..."
Why this sudden move towards measly Paathar?
"A world unseen, unheard and unapproachable..."
Muraakis are the ones who conquer them all.
Muraakis have dared to set their eyes on our Paathar.
Whether he rips the sky apart or makes his way through water...
Jilaan is destined to die in Paathar's waters.
If he was born on a no moon night... then we are that dark night.
"The one who dares to confront us, is headed to his destruction."
"Water should stay blue, not turn red."
Jilaan has sent just one Muraaki to fight us?
Just one.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
Either surrender before the full moon night or die.
Jilaan.
Saiba wishes to fight the war the warriors of Paathar couldn't?
"You don't just fight wars, you also strategize them."
You look lovely when you're angry.
Stop it!
I'll love you... if you want.
"Oh, yeah?"
But don't boss me around.
I don't want to boss you around.
"Then love me for a change, and stop annoying me."
Then love me for a change.
Sometimes you're so...
"Oh, no!"
Why did you go to that movie?
"Well, I think we're even now."
Bye.
I've finished work.
Nervous... arrogant... vain... unkempt... unhealthy... self-satisfied... full of longing... spent...
- strange.
- Full of longing?
- That annoys you.
"- No, arrogant annoys me."
- And self-satisfied and vain.
- Yeah.
It's your turn.
Reserved... frustrated... inhibited... hesitant... closed-up... pulled together... egocentric... not hungry.
You don't want anything to eat?
- Why egocentric?
- I don't know.
- Why do you think I'm strange?
- Because you are.
- You're not egocentric?
- I don't know.
"Sorry, I actually ordered tea."
"Stupid, ugly, idiotic, blind, deaf, mute, moronic!"
Wait...not even on Sunday?
Why take Sunday off?
You need money that bad?
"It's not about money, doc."
Let me explain.
The freelance industry is very tough.
"Whatever work comes in, we have to take it."
Or someone else will.
"And if I don't take the job, they won't hire me next month."
My calendar will be empty.
I'll be jobless.
Hire someone to help?
Get help.
Then they will call and give it to that person instead.
And the other thing is when they call they want me to do the job.
So I should be the one doing it.
Do you think your body will stop at just a rash?
It's just getting started.
F*ck you body.
Don't scratch.
Do you have a nickname?
Yoon.
Yoon.
I'm Imm.
"We're around the same age, so let's be friends."
"When I'm treating someone, I take it very seriously."
I think you also take things seriously too.
So we should be able to understand each other.
"Because when I treat someone and that patient doesn't get better, it's like I'm doing a bad job."
You know what I mean?
"You may wonder... why I ask you all kinds of personal questions that seem like none of my business, but... just trust me, I really do care."
Think of this as a partnership.
I'll let you two get back to work.
What's that?
Just an old magazine.
You done in your room?
Yep.
And now I need permission to boycott an assignment.
Let me guess: math.
Nope.
Me.
My guidance counselor is making everyone write a two-page essay about who you really are.
I don't know the answer to that yet.
"I mean, how old were you when you figured that out?"
I'll let you know when I get there.
Figuring out who you are is a constantly evolving process.
"""Constantly evolving process. """
That's three words.
I need more.
"How about ""sarcastic,"" ""moody,"" and ""cynical""?"
I didn't ask you.
And I'm not a cynic.
"I am totally ""glass is half full. """
"I just acknowledge that the other half of the glass is a desolate void of disappointment, misery, and regret."
Preparing ahead makes me pragmatic.
"Uh, speaking of being prepared..."
Homework?
Done.
I know.
You should call Ripley's.
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.
"What do you guys think, plaid?"
Definitely.
"Although in an indifferent universe there's no room for tragedy, is there?"
You've been reading something more than women's magazines.
You made him swallow his own words.
Doctor Alexander...
It's all right.
I came in to help solve these atrocious crimes.
"Yes, if you could take the DNA sample, Doctor Alexander."
"Thank you, Mr Fordyce."
If you would just open your mouth.
"Tom, you saw how he reacted, how he shifted when you mentioned the article."
His whole antagonism to Dave Stubbs' beliefs.
It's not enough.
You can't charge a man because he believes in nothing.
Tom?
"God, what's wrong with you?"
It's the chemo.
Chemo?
I have cancer.
What do you mean?
What sort of cancer?
The sort that kills you quickly.
Why didn't you tell me?
"Well, I didn't think it was relevant."
"Tom, you have cancer."
That is relevant.
What's the prognosis?
80-20 against me surviving the year.
"They never really know, people do de_ these predictions."
Let's hope.
Can we change the subject?
Shouldn't you be making the most of your life instead of chasing after murderers?
"Well, I figured if I kept busy, it might just go away."
"Since I'm going to church again, it's the same church that sponsors the nursery where you work, it's just..."
"It's really difficult to make friends because people are totally prejudiced against Christians, so I just thought maybe we could be friends."
But we're already friends.
"Great, let's hang out, let's do something tonight."
"Grace, I have a baby."
I have John.
"And by the time the church nursery closes and I get him home and I bathe him and feed him and put him to bed and do my homework, it's, like, 11:00 and I have a husband, so..."
I don't really have time to hang out with you or with any of my other friends.
What if I came over and I help you with John and we did our homework together?
And that would free you up for more friend time.
"Well, it's just that Ricky is in the apartment trying to study at the same time."
"Then I'll bring Jack, too."
"I mean, maybe the four of us can be friends."
"Thanks, Amy."
That's a great idea.
(DIALING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"Hey, what's up?"
Everything okay?
Grace wants to come over with Jack tonight.
For what?
"Just to hang out, be friends."
What?
My dad and Grace's mom want Grace and me to be friends.
What does that have to do with Jack and me?
"Well, Jack is Grace's boyfriend and you're my husband, so..."
So what?
"So, got roped into doing this tonight and I'd like you to go along with it."
"Hey, Ricky!"
Are you coming in for a coffee?
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Okay.
Pass!
Come here.
Why did you go alone?
Why didn't you pass?
But I...
"Don't ""but"" me!"
playing the game is a team responsibility.
Responsibility?
"Well, I definitely see how something could have slipped out of there."
Absolutely.
That would have fallen right out in the middle of the bed.
What about Charlie's hole?
"Just get into the bed, please, and show us how you sleep, guys."
"Well, right off the bat, I think there's a clear solution could have prevented this entire thing."
You guys need to get two beds.
"Oh, maybe I'll get two TVs and two refrigerators."
What are you talking about?
Do we come to your house and tell you how to sleep?
I sleep in a king-sized bed by myself.
"When I have to go to the bathroom, I use a toilet."
Look at...
He...
Dennis on his bed made for kings with his toilet made out of gold.
"Okay, guys, everybody calm down, please."
This is not about lifestyle.
This is not about judgments.
"This is about truth, okay?"
"Now, Charlie and Frank, show us how you were positioned the night of the incident."
Excuse me.
Incidents.
"All right, well, I'm pretty sure I was sleeping like this that night."
"It's just, like, no way it could have been me."
Show him your cardigan.
"Do something."""
"I've got to say something to Jay-Z, so I said this, ladies and gentlemen"
"I said this to the world's biggest rapper. ""Jay-Z!"""
LAUGHTER
I went for a high five with the world's biggest rapper.
"I'm thinking ""You look a right knob now!"
"""You look an absolute penis here!"
"He's not going to give you a high five."""
But he did.
"He gave me the high five Bang, yeah, pretty good!"
APPLAUSE Come here.
Come here.
"Come here, look."
Whoa!
"Feel pretty good now, don't you?"
"It's in a sort of six degrees of separation way, right?"
You have just touched the hand that's touched the hand that has touched Beyonce's knockers.
"Yeah, pretty good, eh?"
Have another go.
"Go on, go on."
"Get lost, she's not a slag."
She's not a slag.
"If you liked it, you should've put a ring on it."
It's your own fault.
"I've been in pantomime, but the one thing I did learn, and I'm going to teach you tonight, is the three secret moves."
There's three secret dance moves.
They're brilliant.
You'll go to any panto this Christmas or any am-dram show and you'll see these three moves.
Here's the first move you require if you want to be in any amateur dramatics dance show - the side sway
LAUGHTER
The second one is a bit more difficult.
I love your accent.
"England, right?"
I've never met anybody from there.
Miss underwood hails from iowa
And is pursuing a ballet career.
"Typically, I find dancers too carefree and irresponsible,"
Though I have always appreciated the discipline of ballet.
"Nice to meet you, dot."
"Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt."
No harm.
Wasn't much more to say.
I'm sure you'll be very happy here.
Uh...
Do you have anything you want to tell me?
"Not at present, no."
Very well.
Let's get on with it.
Mr. Stark believed
The intruder had some advanced technological assistance.
Mr. Stark believes brushing your teeth
Requires advanced technological assistance.
Shall we?
You've done this before.
Himalayas before the war.
"Though, at the time,"
I was strapped to a very amusing spaniard named...
"You are, of course,"
Well within your rights to maintain your privacy.
Thank you.
I agree.
"A charge of treason, out of context,"
Is not necessarily what it appears to be.
I'm the deciding authority here.
But finding the vehicle involved in the accident is also is a tough task...
Exactly.
Come with me.
"Based on the postmortem report, the impact suggests that... it's clear that the vehicle involved in the accident is a car."
There were shattered glass pieces all over.
That must be of the car's windshield.
"If it was an outsider, he couldn't have left the town without changing it."
The same applies to a local person as well.
What if it was a local person...
And he has his car hidden without changing the windshield?
"Okay, you leave."
Investigate this case in your pattern.
Or try a cookery show instead.
Don't ask for my help.
"- Sir, chill..."
I was just giving an opinion.
You are the leader of this case.
Forget about it.
Tell me about the next step.
Start the bike.
What?
I don't know to ride a bike.
I have to do that as well?
"Greetings, Sir."
Greetings.
I want all the details of windshield repairs that have been done since the 18th.
"Okay, Sir."
I'll check it.
Also I need the address of nearby workshops.
"Okay, Sir."
List of people who had changed the wind shield.
"If you're helping him in any way, that constitutes a federal crime."
"I'm aware, and I'd like to help you, Ms. Riley."
Anything I can do to get my son through this alive.
"I, uh, wonder if, um, I could ask a favor of you."
I'd like you to sign this.
It affirms that you'll be cooperating fully with our investigation.
"And if you violate this agreement in any way, you're looking at life in prison."
Do you have a pen?
Thank you.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, that's all I need for today."
"And, uh, please -- do call if you hear anything."
Excuse me.
Who are they?
Oh.
Don't mind them.
They're just checking to see if your phone lines are working properly.
"For your protection, of course."
Of course.
Oh.
"We checked the inside of the house, as well."
Just making sure there's no place for anyone to hide.
"Thanks for your time, Mrs. Westen."
"No, no, thank you."
Bitch.
How long is it gonna take for Jabbar's guys to get here?
I-I just -
- I don't understand why I have to be here.
"I mean, can't -- well, what if I wait outside --"
"I already explained this, okay?"
Jabbar's guys need to think that they caught you by surprise while you were working Mike over.
"That it made me realize that, uh,"
"I need to be honest, too."
"I made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor,"
But I never quite realized until now that...
The greatest sacrifice of all
Was my family.
So the most important thing that I can say here tonight
"Is not to all of you,"
"But, uh, to them."
"I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you,"
And I promise to do everything in my power
"To make it up to you, to make it right again,"
Because I love you.
"My, oh, my."
Did Dr. Van Der Woodsen
Just make a public pass at Rufus' wife?
Looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries.
"Well, I guess you were right about William,"
"But it doesn't matter how he feels about me,"
Because I don't love him.
"I love you, Rufus."
"I know you're comfortable with him, Lil, but I'm not."
I need you to find another doctor.
"Look, I understand why you don't trust him,"
"But surely, you trust me."
"Look, I don't want to fight with you, Rufus."
"Okay, we'll put it aside till tomorrow."
Let's get you home. you know what?
"Right now, more than anything,"
"I just need a quiet night, alone."
Lily.
"Please, just for tonight,"
With beautiful costumes and a full orchestra.

Splendid!

"What do you think of it now, Tyler?"
"Uh, shouldn't Miss Chummy appear for Mr. Tyler's benefit?"
"You see, uh, Judge Peterby owns a small piece of the show."
"I've contributed, not only in the shape of money but also in the shape of, uh, Miss Chummy."
- Like it?
- It looks pretty good.
We have enough capital for a good show but we wanna put on a great show.
"Your 15,000 would allow us to do it."
"Hmm, well, I feel it needs certain changes."
"Now, the Bill Robinson number."
"I think if you played that in a street in Harlem, you'd get more out of it."
"Good idea, we'll use it."
Right Grady?
Right.
Miss Chummy brings a new personality into the theater.
"Uh, my advice would be to accept the boys' generous offer, Tyler."
"You don't have to sell me, Commodore."
"All I wanna know is, will I have a voice in the production?"
"As a partner, you'll have as much to say as Grady and myself."
"They've adopted a little idea of mine, Tyler."
Are you two going to be able to work together?
"No, I don't take that shit personally."
But I can't say the same for sleeping beauty.
God knows he could tell anybody anything.
It was his drive to find his wife that led us to McCarthy.
Perhaps he can still be of some use.
And if he's not?
Well... we pull the plug.
Latest SAT intel has Karp running planes from a dirt strip in Northern Mexico.
"No, we know where Karp is, and his entire family for that matter."
That's never been the issue.
"We just confirmed, Karp's working with the Hunters."
Karp also has ongoing dealings with the CIA.
- He's protected.
- I don't want Karp.
I want the bitch he answers to.
- Your mother.
- She knows more than my dad ever could.
That's whose fingernails you should be pulling out with pliers.
You did well with your father.
You gained more in ten minutes than we have in years.
You hurt him again and I will tear your throat out.
"Careful, Agent Regan."
Threatening a superior officer is cause for immediate dismissal.
You won't.
You need me and you know it.
Let me go to Mexico.
I go through Karp to get my mom and I bring her back.
"In exchange, you release my dad."
I don't feel anything.
"The scute protein's solution's tricky, but I think I'm making progress."
You think?
The winters are brutal in Ithaca.
You'll be cold.
I'll buy a sweater.
You honestly believe that Jameses of this world can keep up with you?
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this can anyone possibly accuse him of being inadequate
Do you want me to skip college?
And stay in Jakarta?
Is that what you're asking me to do?
"There are some, outstanding universities in this city."
"Can you imagine, how good we'd be for each other?"
Yes.
But you do know that can't happen.
Of course I know.
"Do you know what ""apocalypse"" actually means?"
Tell me.
It's from the greek.
"""Apokalypsis"" meaning to uncover what you couldn't see before"
A way out of the dark.
You're sweet talk still needs work.
I'll get on that.
"You're a very good teacher, Eric."
I always forget stuff when I walk out the door.
If any of my ex-boyfriends had picked up on that perhaps things would have turned out differently... but probably not.
Zach was my first serious boyfriend and I was madly in love.
I thought he was the best.
You're the best!
You're the best!
Apparently so did my best friend Stephanie.
Baby!
I know this looks bad.
As well as Liz.
"Low doses of methaqualone-- downers, ludes, disco biscuits."
Very retro but making a comeback.
It was just enough to impair
Petty Officer Adams' motor skills.
"I mean, these babies can increase your sex drive, but it also can cause drowsiness and slurred speech, low heart rate, vomiting..."
"Ah, well, so much for the sex part."
So the question is: who slipped it to him and where?
"Well, test everyone who was on liberty that night."
Can I borrow McGee to help?
Absolutely.
"And I swear, your grandma got these crazy eyes and took off after your mom like a cat chasing a mouse."
"Ooh, I can still see them eyes."
"Would Grandma have chased us, Mom?"
"Yeah, she sure would have."
"Nah, she'd be spoiling you guys every chance she got."
"Right, Jack?"
"Yes, Michael, she would have."
"Hey, thanks for letting me stay."
"Well, the kids miss seeing you."
I miss them.
"Just gonna let the old man sleep through the party, huh?"
"Uncle Mike's got great stories, Dad."
"- You finish your paper, son?"
- Yep.
"Nine whole pages, single-spaced."
- Nice.
- Uncle Mike fixed the dishwasher.
"Oh, just a loose valve."
No big deal.
"Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Fix-It, but let's go."
It's my day to drop the kids off at school.
Can Uncle Mike come?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were serious.
- At least you get letters.
"- Oh sure, Lily."
Most of the poets that come in here don't even want to see my face when they fuck me.
"- Rule number one is to make them cum, right?"
"They come in five minutes, they owe you for half an hour."
- Good.
What else?
"- Ah, but a professional always offer a massage, so the guy doesn't feel like a total loser."
- And
- it's the best way to get another half an hour out of the prick.
- That's my girl.
* And night falls on a weekend day
* And all the young and some old
* Come out to play

- When were you last employed?
"- Um, well, I, uh,"
I do volunteer work?
"- I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't make myself very clear."
"When did you last cease full-time, paid employment?"
"- Paid, um."
It's about two years ago.
"- Well, that's the reason why you're currently under review for your Newstart Allowance."
We just need to be making sure that you're still actively looking for work.
"- Yeah, I have been."
I have been.
- review our options.
- Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
And you got a grand total of two.
"Option A, Brandon takes the deal."
"Option B, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big."
"Look, look."
What about... reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon... informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if..."
God forbid...
that they decide to...
- take revenge?
- What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about ""if I talk, they'll kill me""."
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can
- work in some witness protection.
"- No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"So, this kid ends up losing."
"And I go to him, and he doesn't pay me."
"Instead, he goes to the Dean, tells the Dean, and the Dean expels me."
When did this happen?
Um...3 weeks ago.
I don't know.
But there's 2 days left in winter break and I can't even go back to school.
And what about the money?
"God, I owe this guy $6,000 now, and next week it's gonna be 7."
"He says if I don't have it by the end of the week, he's gonna come to my house and take it from my mother, so..."
Let's get some lunch.
Bailiff:
All rise.
Judge:
"Having reviewed the petition briefs, and based on arguments presented,"
I hereby deny the petitioner's request for asylum.
"Your honor, may I be heard?"
"You have been heard, Mr. mooney."
There's no legal basis to grant asylum here.
The petitioner shall be returned to her home immediately upon her release from the hospital.
[Gavel bangs]
How long you been out of school?
Ahem.
I got kicked out 2 weeks before winter recess.
What have you been doing?
"Oh, you know."
"Intercepting mail, phone calls."
"Just trying to figure this whole thing out, basically."
"Well, you gotta tell your mom."
[Cell phone rings]
"That's, uh..."
That's the bookie.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.
It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.
We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint, rubber tiles... oh, my God."
Playground turf.
They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.
Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change, and he'll tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
Wait.
"How is it that you caught up with this guy, but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
Surprise me.
We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
And Petty?
He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means, but the turf..."
What color was the paint?
The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
So we just make it all nice.
"Everything's easy, fun, we're drinking, we're smiling."
Okay?
We can't leave till sundown.
"Guys, we all need to be together first thing in the morning, okay?"
Which is exactly why we have to find Trudy.
"Otherwise, we won't all be there."
Let's get out of here now.
"Reconvene later at the beach, at 1900 hours."
You with me?
"Joey, we are not gonna be able to finish the program if we get caught!"
"All right, bring it in."
"Hey, come on, Shane!"
"We walk to the other side, we get caught."
"This way, we canoe out nice and easy, we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach."
We pull up.
"We find the singles' side, we find a dance floor, we find some cocktails."
And we find Trudy and we bring her back...
"Yeah, we find Trudy and we bring her right back here."
This is crazy.
Trust me.
I was an Eagle Scout.
My mind is a compass.
I can handle these situations.
I've been trained to do so.
"Now follow me and I'm gonna get you there, but we gotta do it quick and we gotta do it quiet."
Come on.
"These are not the best laid plans, okay?"
"I'm just gonna go on record right now, okay?"
I do not think this has a high chance...
"If we keep up this pace, we'll be there in 20 minutes!"
I hope so!
"Well, I don't recall the details but, when these things came up, they would have been looked into."
Did you ever deal with complaints of abuse at Sands View Boys' Home?
That doesn't ring a bell.
"There was a specific allegation made by the social worker that we're talking about,"
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.
Sorry.
"Well, Stephens-Lloyd claimed he compiled a list of authority figures who, with the collusion of staff, conducted systematic abuse of boys resident at Sands View."
"See, I've never even heard of this Stands View place."
Oh!
Sorry.
"- I'll get that, love!"
- OK!
Here he is!
- Hope I'm not too late.
- Spot on.
"How you keeping, Ted?"
"Yeah, can't complain, can't complain."
I hope you don't mind me calling you.
"Not at all, sir."
A matter of professional courtesy.
As you were.
As you were.
"Oh, now, you'll stay after, won't you?"
Joyce'll kill me if I let you off the hook from her Victoria sponge!
"That's very kind of you, sir!"
Thank you.
Don't mind me.
"Now, where were we?"
Where's Hastings?
Briefing.
Inspectors and above only.
Kate.
"- Well, who's bringin' it?"
- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
- Where do you want it?
"- Oh, shit."
This side.
Beat it!
I'm gonna check on this address.
"Ifthey don't know you, it's your ass."
- I thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We're goin' now.
Goodbye!
Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood."
Why don't you detach us?
"Give us a shot, at least till we find out ifthere's anything here."
Everybody wants Weinstock.
Maybe here's the lead we're looking for.
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin'.
You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs."
You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score.
"Big score, my ass!"
At best he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.
I wouldn't be infringing' on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already?"
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what's happened to you guys?"
They said your father could be released.
"We compared out destinies, like young girls comparing dresses."
Now she was going to be reunited with a saint.
"A martyr, beautiful... noble."
"Her gift was living, and she got theater instead."
My gift was theater.
Instead I got snarled up in life...
So it goes.
She went back.
She died of love.
I waited here for a visa that's never issued to dissidents' sister-in-laws.
And I became as bad at acting as I am in life.
"""It's like the sky in the country""."
"It's the Atlantic, the wind from the ocean."
You know we have seagulls here in Paris?
"That's what I'm doing at the moment, The Seagull."
"Well, the play."
My daughter plays the lead.
"Nowadays, after two cheap porno films, you can even become a member of the Academy."
She arranged for me to have a part in the play.
Do you know it?
Not really.
Sea birds don't fly to Hungary.
And what kind of bird are you?
What do you do in Hungary?
I was told to work with my hands.
My head still hurts.
A bird of different feather.
"I'm sorry, you make me feel uneasy."
Nestor?
To the theater!
"The bird touches down on the mud, leaves his mark, more beautiful than his flight, than his life."
!
"If they see that you've been making a detailed record of all the fancy gifts you've been going them, even a fool would know your intended use for that journal."
"You may not end up in prison, but you would lose their trust at the very least."
What?
Release the criminal who stole government property!
One of them has already died in confinement.
I fear it will hurt your esteemed name if the other one dies as well.
Add glory to your name with display of mercy.
But what if that boy starts talking and causing trouble?
Don't worry.
I will make certain that he keeps his mouth shut.
Chun-su!
Chun-su!
Thank god you're all right!
What's wrong with you?
Do you know what he did to get you out?
I don't care.
Chun-su...
What's wrong with you?
Your friend risked his...
Don't even mention him.
He's no friend of mine.
"I told you, you're wrong about him!"
"Chun-su, Baron Huh would like to see you."
Go ahead and drink it.
"Me, sir?"
I had them brew the best herbs for your injury.
It will make moving around much easier.
Sir...
A good medicine is always bitter.
Go ahead an drink it.
I apologize.
Cut it already‎.
No more fights‎.
We have to keep moving‎.
"Agree‎, disagree‎."
"Do not mess with the Ramrod‎, Ping Pong‎."
It's good advice‎.
"Atwood‎, Whitaker‎."
I need to make a quick attack Braunlage‎.
Atwood‎.
You'll be a sergeant in it‎.

with some stubborn Germans east of town‎.
They can not do that ‎.‎.‎.
Is the Mayor‎?
‎- ¿Brugermeister‎?
‎
"- Si‎, ese ‎.‎.‎."
to convince them that the war was almost over‎.
Yes‎.
"He tried‎, but he was killed‎."
It's just a small resistance ‎.‎.‎.
that somehow went unnoticed‎.
What sugieroes entering there and a little scared‎.
"Want to relocate inventory or more soldiers‎, sir‎?"
No‎.
The two groups already have are enough‎.
We'll do it quickly‎.

- Do you have some replacements‎?
Where?
Taking Owen to our place?
"Well, I didn't want to go there."
"I don't like Owen baby, I don't want to see Owen."
What's your schedule like?
I need your help.
I cannot get to close because I'm a stranger in this country.
There are some things which are difficult to study because of that.
I watched the creature from the empire state building but at night it's closed.
How can I study the behaviour of this creature?
It's on a private property.
I don't know...
"I'd like to help you, but I don't know what you expect me to do."
I'm just a college acting teacher.
"Fuck see Owen, OK."
"I got business, I got things to do."
See fucking Owen.
"Well, listen..."
I'd like to help you in some way but...
"I've an appointment right now, can we get in touch tomorrow?"
"These aliens are killing people, you're the only person I know in New-York."
"Telephone me tomorrow, keep in touch OK?"
Almost everything you've done since you left me has been self destructive.
Adrian is a real bad influence on you.
She didn't care anything about you.
She's only using you.
You're ruining your carrer.
Your future.
What are you talking about?
"It's the only thing I care, about my carrer."
What do you thing I'm doing right now?
I'm getting ready to shoot with a fashion photographer I met at the club.
Then he'd be out a career and a girlfriend.
He might have panicked.
"OFFICE OF MAESTRO REINHARDT OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20"
You must excuse me.
I'm very busy.
"I must finish my notes on Verdi's ""Forza del Destino""."
It's my new production for the spring.
"Actually, Mr. Reinhardt, we were hoping to finally speak to an adult."
"Yeah, no offense, but this crew and these musicians... getting high, having sex..."
it's like a frat house on viagra.
Finally.
People who understand what I have to go through every day.
How can I help?
Let's start with the night of the murder.
Did you see Laura during intermission?
"No, I did not."
Can we ask where you were?
We've asked everybody else.
I was right here.
Resting.
"- Okay, well, were you alone?"
"- Yes, I was."
If I'd known I'd be grilled by some Visigoth... / A what?
It's a barbarian tribe that invaded Rome.
I remember that from the one history class I didn't cut.
I'm sure you were a very charming street urchin.
Any other questions?
"Well, did Laura have any enemies in the house?"
"We heard she was very, very ambitious, and you were gonna make her first violin."
She told people that?
I suppose she felt entitled on account of... my friendship with her mother.
Or because she was a prodigy.
- Walking through the woods to meet my love this day in Marymount.
- Good.
"And what do you see, Lady Edith?"
Focus.
You must see through her eyes.
- I see...
I see fawns and nymphs.
They're transformed into brutes.
They dance around the maypole where we shall be married.
They are the devils in ruined souls that people the black wilderness.
- Good.
"Now, Lady Edith, what is your family's relation to evil?"
- We are well acquainted with evil.
"These darks and monsters are my brethren, maddened by their troubles into a gay despair like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician."
- Good.
Now you will awaken... as Lucy.
"Now tell me, Lucy, is the night's ritual a dream... or a reality?"
- I...
I don't...
- Ugh!
- A dream?
- Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?
Are you trying to spite me?
- The men and women have seemed very pleased with my performance.
- They've been pleased.
They've been pleased with your performance?
This isn't a performance.
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become!
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
"You can fix them, maybe, but it doesn't mean they didn't happen."
So don't go in there to that girl and try to sugarcoat it and pretend it's all better when it's not.
"Well, I should've seen it."
"You know, I could've stopped it."
You are not responsible for what that girl did any more than you're responsible for what happened to me.
"I'm sorry, Violet."
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
You came when you could.
"No, no."
"I'm sorry that I did not come sooner... before, with Katie."
You came when you could.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mm.
"Shh, shh."
You're here now.
"So a bad thing happened, and I can't change that."
"And sometimes the things people say to try to make you feel better, they just come out sounding... stupid."
"So, um... you tell me what you need."
What if he dies?
"What if he dies, and I never get to tell him I'm sorry?"
"Nobody beat me, nobody tried to steal my baby, nobody stabbed me, but..."
"I am wounded, Sam."
Noah?
"Oh, my heart is broken."
And I shouldn't even complain about it because... nothing happened.
"I mean, nothing happened to me, not like what happened to the Larsens and Violet."
"You know, sometimes..."
I'm almost jealous of them?
"Because everybody can see their injuries, so they have a right to be messed up."
I sent noah back to his wife.
I did the right thing.
One day in his hospital in Switzerland he told people he was going to dance a solo performance.
He put up a crucifix made out of black and white cloth.
He climbed up on it like Christ.
"He wanted to tell people about war  the death, destruction, and emptiness of war."
Tomoko went home.
Without eating breakfast?
She gave this back to you.
"""Paganini"""
I haven't seen you in a while.
I saw Yagi the other day.
I got a letter saying that the place on the hill was sold.
"I was wondering what was up, so I tailed him."
He seems to be pretty worried about you.
Ha ha.
He was looking for Takehara-san everywhere.
"You didn't tell him yourself, did you?"
Of course not!
"In fact, it was I who suggested to him buy it for your studio."
I don't want to build a new studio anymore.
"In fact, I'm thinking of giving up my studio in Tokyo."
Why?
"I don't think I'm going to continue working, that's why."
"Mrs., don't make me worry like that."
"If you're worried, remember that I'm behind you all the way."
You mustn't quit like that.
I don't think Yagi likes it when I dance.
"Mrs, you need to do something about Yagi and his dreary ways."
"Mrs., go it alone!"
You need time for yourself and to get your enthusiasm back.
It's about time you got a divorce.
Get a divorce!
That would be better.
It's bad enough you let the guy go.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Assaulting a federal officer is always a big deal, and you know it."
The fact that you didn't arrest him tells me you're not thinking straight.
"Look, don't worry about me, King."
All right?
I'm fine.
Let's just get back to work.
"Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead on the stolen money."
"Yeah, I'm on it."
I don't see anything.
Where's the lead?
"Well, it's actually not my lead, so..."
"Took you long enough, Percy."
I don't exactly have all day.
"Yeah, sorry, something came up."
You called Gregorio.
E-mailed.
"And it was just some serial numbers, so this was all her choice."
"It's not a big deal, Pride."
"Well, actually it is."
"The bills came from a bank robbery in Biloxi, Mississippi, six weeks ago."
A teller slipped a dye pack into the money before the robbers took off.
Seems that makes our marine a bank robber.
Doesn't explain why Jared was stabbed or who'd want to kill him.
How many robbers in Biloxi?
"Witnesses said there were four, including a getaway driver, heavily armed, too."
SONJA:
"So, robbers turning against each other?"
What's going on?
"Oh, hey, Hannah."
Agent Pride.
"- Well, she hasn't."
"The guidance system malfunctioned at the point of re-entry, so instead of the Atlantic Ocean,"
- she may well be in this area.
- (MARSH):
Are you sure?
The American consulate in Nagoro just radioed me.
I've been out alerting all the village chiefs.
"Well, having been on a lunar orbit,"
"I'd say that at this moment,"
Sally is the world's most valuable chimp.
(SCREECHES)
"As soon as she's found, she has to be given a very complete examination."
"Now, the American consulate in Nagoro is sending out a truck with a military and scientific attaché, but they don't know the area as well as we do."
"Poor thing, she might've been injured in the landing."
Or what about possible attack by another animal in the bush?
"Uh, she has to be in an exhausted condition, so wherever she is she's in serious jeopardy."
"Mike, get me a dart rifle from the truck."
- Mmm.
"- Hedley, I'll go with you."
- Good.
"- Jack, you and Mike take a look down by the river."
"And, Paula, you stick right here by the radio."
(JUDY CHATTERING)
"Look, Judy, come on now."
This is no time for fun and games.
Come on.
Get over there.
"Go on, scoot."
(ENGINE STARTS)
(SCREECHING)
"Come on, Judy, we have work to do."
You heard the Daktari.
"Look, Martha Dumptruck, revenge of the nerds, and hello kitty -- they rode the same bus."
"Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"Well, that would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"Dean, there's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles."
"Then whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative -- well, that's super."
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty!"
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
"Man, I don't get it."
"No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here."
"Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair."
"I mean, hell, a hangnail."
Something's got to be tying the ghost to this place.
We just got to find it.
Yeah.
Got a new driving permit.
Issued two weeks ago.
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk McGregor sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
- McGregor?
- Yeah.
Why?
I knew his son.
Jesus.
What if I fall asleep and all the good stuffs taken away instead?
They'd have to find it first.
"I am your superior, you know that?"
"Harry, why don't you just stop gambling?"
"Look, I have patches for my addictions."
They have patches for porn?
Why are you really here?
You're making my girls nervous.
I want to know what has spooked Freddie Lau.
Why has he called in my debt?
- Belshazzar was the king of Babylon.
- Here we go.
A man of immense wealth and power with many scary friends.
Just like Freddie Lau?
"One evening, he holds a fabulous feast for them all."
"But during the feast, Belshazzar notices a hand come down from the heavens and starts writing on the wall."
- It predicts...
- Belshazzar's own death.
"So, what, you're saying that someone's threatening to kill Freddie Lau?"
Why else would Lau be planning to sell up and leave London?
"Ah, come on, Kaleem."
Freddie Lau would never let anyone muscle him out.
You're not telling me something.
"Come on, leave now."
I have to watch my girls like a hawk.
"Oh, did that um..."
missing stripper of yours ever turn up?
- What was her name?
- Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Some of my colleagues fished a girl out of the Thames yesterday.
- Matched her description.
I might have questions for you later.
"(Horn Honking, People Chattering)"
"Passports, please."
You came to French Morocco four days ago?
That's right.
"You are a doctor, sir?"
"Yes, I'm a surgeon, a tourist and American citizen."
Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
- l didn't have.
- (Bicycle Bell Ringing)
You were in Paris recently?
"Yes, I was attending a medical convention."
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.
You had an aperitif with him in your hotel room.
You ate at the same restaurant last night.
"Yes, but at different tables."
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him for the first time yesterday on a bus.
"And yet, out of 5,000 people in a great marketplace, he comes to you when he is about to die."
is that the action of a casual acquaintance?
I know absolutely nothing about Louis Bernard.
"Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau."
The
- What's that?
Perhaps you have also never heard of the American fbi?
"Now, wait. I - lt would be so much easier for both of us if you would cease to pretend."
Look here -
The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover.
That's why he was killed.
He told you what he had discovered.
Why?
Because he placed complete confidence in you.
"Sophie, I've been looking at color choices, and how would you feel about us in a nude?"
Max could go nude but you don't have the rack to pull it off.
Does anyone have a knife?
"Max, why do you have a switchblade to work in a dessert bar?"
My mother always told me to carry protection.
Wait 'til you see Grandma Kuchenski's dress.
They don't make them like they used to.
"You know, forced gypsy labor is illegal now."
Here we go.
- Oh.
- Uh...
"Sophie, was your grandma the Crypt Keeper?"
What's going on out here?
What's all that white powder in the air?
"I'm trying to run a restaurant, not an 80's disco."
"Oh, put a sock in it."
I'm buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings.
I'd get mad but I'm mildly attracted to you right now.
Just mildly?
"I mean, now I'm getting mad."
Sorry.
Wedding drama.
Her dress just fell completely to pieces... like I'm assuming I'll do in the near future.
"Whatever you need anything bridal, go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn."
That's where I got my dress when I was broke and straight.
So you weren't always into women?
Of course I was.
Except those three years in Scientology.
"Well, it looks like the three of us are going to go dress shopping now."
Yeah.
"And you know, I got to go wash my hands 'cause they're covered in old lady DNA."
"Well, that's that."
And you're still acting like this?
"Then, I guess..."
I should investigate these invisible men for murder.
"If you're going to throw around accusations, at least make some sense!"
Or give us a name!
"Or why don't you bring some pictures, or any evidence at all?"
"Hey, follow him."
Officer!
Why are there no security cameras in this building?
Can you show me the footage from the elevator camera?
That camera...
it breaks every time we fix it.
So we gave up on it.
But I'm wondering if someone might be breaking it on purpose.
"Wow, seriously..."
Hey.
Why are you following me everywhere I go?
Are you worried I'm going to run away?
What do you mean?
Why would you run away when you didn't do anything wrong?
"Oh, geez..."
Joon Gi Moon?
The one who owned the sushi restaurant?
Did you know him?
"Then, the murder victim that Im Tae Ho was talking about..."
How did you know the victim?
- Park Seon Woo.
"- Oh, yes..."
"He was a colleague of mine, below me."
We were like blood brothers.
We also worked together once.
We were partners.
I'm here to see Alvers.
Marcus.
Michael.
How was your trip?
Interesting.
"I still don't understand why you risked so much down in Mexico, why you didn't come here directly."
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn't killed by the bomb,"
I'm sure our buyers took care of her once they found out she didn't deliver the virus.
"Either way, she's out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We'll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
"Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back."
"No, we haven't."
"I know what you must be thinking, but you need to give me a chance to explain."
I don't know what to think.
"Look, I'm happy that you're okay, but this thing... you have a baby, Chase."
"We've been together for more than three months, and you kept this secret from me."
Who's the mother?
Where does she fit into this?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I didn't know I had a daughter until a month ago.
How could you not know?
Angela's mother and I went out last year.
"Okay, it's over."
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"Now she calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby, and that I'm the father."
"And she's in trouble, and she can't handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
Do you want me to pull it up for you now?
Yeah
I don't think she's going to give them anything.
We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
What can I do?
"Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at."
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years.
Each time only for a couple of days.
Maybe he was meeting somebody.
Cross it with the other suspects in our database.
"Let me know what you come up with, okay?"
Okay.
"Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again."
I already answered that.
"What is it, Edmunds?"
Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.
"Rae, could you pause that?"
She give us anything new on Alvers?
"No, other than the probability she knew him personally."
She's not cooperating.
What are we doing?
Richards is working on her now.
I think that's a mistake.
Why?
"/I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of."
She'll manipulate him.
All Richards does is inflict pain.
There's no way for her to manipulate him.
All right.
"How much more of this you want to endure, Nina?"
If you two are through making out...
"I'd like to see you in my office, please."
What have we got?
We got victim number 3 in Wisconsin.
He's hitting his stride now.
"Nina Getz, Valerie Wheaton, and now this."
Somebody's got to go to Milwaukee this afternoon... and tell them that we ain't got jack shit.
It sure as hell isn't going to be me.
Be sure and show 'em that drawing you got... from a blind witness.
You just keep pushing me.
"Hey, you need it!"
Then don't you just take me off... this fucking case right now.
"Oh, ho!"
"No way, Jose."
"You're going right down with me, asshole."
"Why don't you lighten up, lieutenant?"
"Stay out of this, Ridgely."
You two know more about this case than anybody.
"This guy's out there laughing at you, man."
He's beating you.
I want you to go out and shut the motherfucker down... 'cause you're not getting off the case.
You're going to retire on this one.
I'm going straight to Milwaukee.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll get you a ride from someone downstairs.
I got this fucking jagoff of a lieutenant... who's blaming me for the fucking murder.
Here for the murder?
They're all inside.
You live here?
I'm sorry.
Why do people say that?
Why don't they just say that it sucks shit your mom's dead?
"You go backwards, you fall on your back."
- Give me that gun.
"- I get these bullet things out, I'll be comfortable."
Now you can point it at me all day if you like.
- Just why did you come here?
"- Well, I-I— Marjorie—"
"You don't mind me calling ""Marjorie,"" do you?"
Of course you don't.
"Marjorie, why don't you give up this life of yours?"
You're far too young and beautiful to spend it in jail.
- What do you take to get these delusions?
- You're wrong.
- I'm doing this for your own good.
Now let's sit down.
- Leave my coat alone.
- I'll hang it up for you.
"- Please, give it to me."
Give it to me.
- I won't drop it.
"- Now, please go."
Dash it!
I can't go until I do the thing I came here to do.
Why don't you give up this life you're leading.
It's not going to get you anywhere.
Oh?
That's most flattering.
But just what do you think I am?
"You can stop all this bluff because I happen to know you've borrowed some plans... that belong to the government, and I think it only sporting to tell you... that a large number of detectives are following you around."
- Now I know there's something wrong with you.
- Don't go on pretending.
Two Scotland Yard men followed you to my house yesterday.
- Really?
I said ifs not Zaer Kheder's order
You will go neither to Zaer Kheder nor to Tangak_ That's it!
"So, sorry to disturb you, Bashirou's mommy."
- It's early to leave.
"- I leave, I have something to do."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye
- Don't bother yourself.
- Please.
"It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
What did you say?
"- It's not related to anybody, if I'm going to go to Tangak or not."
- Don't talk nonsense.
Did you look at yourself?
"They forced your father to drive out of Tangak, they did it to me."
"What the hell are you going to do there, as a baby boy?"
You are a little boy.
Are you such a man to go to Tangak?
So?
Donkey work!
"Pottering, minor works and difficulties are for mine and playing Ketfledrum for the others'."
Just you tell me is it fair?
"Bashirou, tell me definitely how much?"
"- Playing Kettledrum, definitely."
"- No, ifs not the way."
From morning to dawn.
You are headstrong like your father
"Obstinate, dogged, inflexible, tough."
"If I wasn't headstrong, how could I play Kettledrum till dawn?"
Ashoura is perennial; ifs not going to be finished this year.
"Next year, God willing."
"Don't say God willing, Zaer or say it in the way means ""yes""."
How else did I know which hotel you'd be in?
Which amoeba scratching his crutch not a million miles away might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world and tell Lenny you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them, Calum?"
You miserable little snitch.
I got used to having your big cheery smile around.
- Didn't want to see you leave.
- What do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning
- I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"As long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So can you can get us into the house?
I might just be up to it.
Sweet.
Ooh!
That's the front door.
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow, OK?"
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry to disturb you."
- That's all right.
- I've broken down just along the road and wouldn't you know it but the bloody mobile...!
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...
You'll have to tell me where I am.
- Of course.
Come inside.
- Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
"What do you want,ron?"
I want to keep you up-To-Date on the case as a courtesy.
We're gonna argue self-Defense.
So?
We're thinking of calling you as a character witness.
To say what?
"In a self-Defense case, character for peacefulness,"
"For non-Violence, is admissible."
Did you know that?
Since you two are friends--
"Whoa,whoa,whoa."
We're not friends.
I took her to some basketball games.
We never even-- Fought?
Is that what you were gonna say?
You didn't get into any fights.
Good.
"It won't help us that much, but it's admissible"
To prove she had a peaceful character.
"Though i have to say,"
Testifying won't be so pleasant for you.
"The tabloids are all over this case,"
And the d.A. Will cross you pretty hard.
"As for how your wife handles it,i can't say."
"You do have a prenup, right?"
Or?
Sorry?
"You're the lawyer,ron."
Great lawyers always give you an alternative.
"Look,if you've got a business trip coming up"
"Or plans with your wife,"
I don't want a trial to mess that up.
"All right, Mov, thanks."
"Well, Mohadevan says it was some kind of insect venom although it's unlike anything she's ever seen."
It's a good thing you didn't get too much of that in you.
She said you should just keep taking the antihistamines for the next 24 hours and you should be fine.
That thing used me and my friend to get to you.
I almost got you killed.
You were right not to trust me.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"No, that's not the point."
You did fine...
all right?
You have a little work to do on the whole trust thingy.
What do you think?
Is it me?
"You just rest, okay?"
"Just, take it easy."
So what the hell was this thing again?
A demon bug?
"It's actually the other way around, a bug demon."
"Well, I think you actually both might be right."
"You two, you're just like peas in a pod lately."
"Hey, you know what?"
I am so ready to take my pension and retire somewhere else sweetheart.
- What did it want?
- Apparently it wanted me.
It was killing those kids to draw me in.
"It's dead now, so you don't have to worry about that anymore."
Which means I am free to help you two find that vampire you're been looking for.
"Oh yeah, yeah, I figured it out all by myself."
I can do that.
I'm a private detective.
- NO!
"""He was shirtless, and he was ripped,"
"""and he was carrying a bow and arrow."
"""And he saw me with Crackle,"
"""and he thought I was in danger."
"""And he shot Crackle through the heart."
"""And I cried and said,"
"""'You don't know what you're doing!"
'
"""But shooting the dragon through the heart"
"""is what we needed to get back to reality."
"""So we landed back in the library."
"""And the old white man returned to his job"
"""as the Little Rock public librarian,"
"""and I started classes at a segregated high school."
"And that's why I don't like white people."""
[applause]
"I eventually asked my mom about it, and I was way off."
Way off.
"My parents named me Sasheer, which is hard for some people to pronounce, which I get."
"There's two ""S""s in there."
So...
"One's a ""sss,"" one's a ""shh."""
"So it's like, ""What do we do?"""
And the people who get my name wrong the most are white people.
And I don't want to make it a race thing.
But...
Numbers are in.
Studies have shown that the demographic that consistently gets my name wrong are Caucasian.
"I did this show once, and the host was white, and probably still is."
And...
She could not get my name for the life of her.
Kept saying things like Shasheer or Saheer and moving letters around in my name and attacking it like a Sudoku puzzle.
Now!
Shoot a propane tank and you'll just get a big cloud of cold gas.
You need an open flame and real good aim.
Get down!
"Yeah, Sam, I had to drive around, make sure we weren't followed."
She could be anywhere now.
Gotta go.
- What's happening?
- We'll get to that.
"- For now, I need to know why someone wants you dead."
- It's a long story.
"Well, that's a long story that starts with Greenway Cargo, right?"
- Give me the short version for now.
- I was the controller.
"Uh, mostly wrote checks, did invoices."
It was a job.
I've been a C.P.A. for 15 years.
- Need to get to the marked for death part.
- After a while...
I realized I was paying vendors I'd never heard of... for cargo that was never delivered.
- Front companies.
"- They were into all kinds of stuff- weapons, ivory, human cargo."
Th-That's what the F.B.I. said.
"Anyway, they came to my house, said they were investigating the company, investigating me."
- Unless you testify.
"- I didn't want to get involved, but they said I'd go to jail."
I said I'd think about it.
Then- things started happening.
- Things?
What things?
"- I had people following me... phone calls, guys watching my house."
Then my wife... goes out in my car.
- What?
About what?
That they're setting him up to laugh at him.
They're laughing with him now.
They think he's cool ever since he took up your cause.
- What cause?
"- ""Go, drugs!"""
He doesn't know what I do.
You keep clinging to that raft.
"Okay, this vote is on a motion by Walter Stringer to request a variance from zoning regulation 11.6, for a front yard setback."
- All in favor?
- Try 11.2.
- Excuse me?
"- It's zoning regulation 11.2, not 6."
And Walt is not adding a family room.
"He's adding a giant garage for his boat, which is gonna cut off all the light to his neighbor's dining room."
Read the plans.
A family room doesn't have concrete floors and a door that's operated by a remote.
That's complete bullshit.
"You're not in charge here anymore, Wilson."
Lucky for you or I'd throw your nautical ass right out of here.
Really.
"Buy a fucking slip in the marina, Captain Cheap-Ass."
Excuse me.
You're out of order.
"Now, all those in favor of granting the motion, raise your hand and say ""aye."""
Aye.
"All of those against, ""nay."""
- Nay.
- Motion is denied.
"- Fuck you, Wilson!"
- Go play with your dinghy!
"You didn't like the music, old polkas... lt was embarrassing that no one came for her."
"So I went with the girl... what's wrong with her, what is it about her?"
And what was I meant to do about it?
"I knew those boys, so I spoke to them."
"That was a disgrace, did she have to hear it?"
Tono had to shout out there:
Isn't your daughter dancing?
For ages I've been wondering whether to tell you.
I'm disgusted with life.
And you often don't seem to be a mother.
"- Heavens, how could you think that?"
- How could I think that?
"I can't see any love on your part, any feeling, it's all about money."
"You come home happy - l got that much there, I had a nice little job, I earned that much... I managed to get a bargain."
But you don't make anyone happy.
"Just money, money."
"Just money, money."
Because that's what I see.
How can you see it?
Who do you think I'm doing it for?
How can you say that to me?
I do it all for you.
You have no idea how it was for us.
I don't understand how you could say that to me.
Must it be money all the time?
"No dream, no ideal, how it could be."
You talk to me about ideals?
"Really, you see nothing but money."
D'you think I wasn't young?
Wasn't I eighteen once?
I was nineteen when I left school.
"I learned languages, I learned to play the piano, to have a good life."
"But if I get elected president, I will bring it back."
Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.

I have never been more excited about a presidential campaign.
I have never seen a grassroots uprising.
This is not the Republicans versus the Democrats.
That's right.
This is the elites of the Republican and Democratic Party who have driven this country into the ditch versus Donald J. Trump and the rest of America.
I thank you for your support.
If you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins...
And you're short 2 sen on a bill of Y130

What is it?
"Fujio's homework, from yesterday"
He's starting junior high this year
The preliminaries are so complicated

Yes.

It's our cross to bear

Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
- Pretty ugly stuff.
- That sounds like Armadillo's M.O.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"- An ax, maybe a machete."
- How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
- Three to four hours.
- So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
- Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
- Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr. Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
"What was that, uh, legal stuff that Audrey wanted to talk to you about this morning?"
Nothing.
Just estate planning.
[laughing]
"Hey, listen, uh, there's no reason we should both be here waiting for the check."
Why don't you go get the kids?
And I'll see you back at the place.
Sure.
[ting]
Cheers.
"Hey, guys."
So what are we celebrating?
You guys being perfect strangers this morning and now fast friends?
How are you planning on robbing Audrey?
"- No, no..."
"- No, no, no, no, Lance."
You got it all wrong.
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
"Okay, then, Cousin Pete, explain."
Let's hear a perfectly reasonable explanation for how you came to be sitting here celebrating with the man who just bought your grandmother's farm for a price that would be insultingly low if the place were currently on fire.
- Get you anything?
- I'm good.
Okay.
"Come on, fellas."
You're caught.
"You can waste time trying to deny it, or we start to talk about what it's going to take to get me not to turn you in."
Gentlemen.
Two years ago...
"I was going through security at Sea-Tac, and, uh, all of a sudden..."
this is long story sounding...

"- Good to see you, man."
- How are you?
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm James.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do you play?
- Saxophone.
"- Oh, shit."

"When I think of New Orleans,"
"I don't think of recording studios, really."
I just think of hundreds of years of music.
Preservation Hall really took hold after the hurricane when people realized that there was something to lose.
Look at this guy.
Wow.
Yeah.
What a trip.
This is a trip.
It was a little tricky because Preservation Jazz Hall is not used to a blaring rock band.
"We moved the drums across the room from traditionally where they play, which opened up the sound a little bit."
Then we moved their amps...
Just baffled them enough so it wasn't completely collapsing the room with volume.
It's funny because you can hear people walking by on the street.
"You hear the horses clip-clop by and the carriages, and people peering in the windows and the street performers strolling by."
"Our microphones catch miscellaneous noises going on, and that's part of the charm."
Where's Ben Jaffe?
"Hey, Ben!"
Is it gonna be okay that we record here?
This is so cool!
This is like my childhood dream come true!
All right?
"What if our guy knew her at church, work, or something... and he's obsessed with her?"
But she dies.
She donates her organs... and he goes after the people that have them.
"Now, postmortem wrist wounds... blood loss speeds the decay of the organs."
"The result is, they can't be passed on again."
I'm betting that this girl Davison... is the donor for all of our victims...
"Getz, Tattersall, and Emma."
Emma is not dead.
I heard back from Ned in Indiana.
The latest victim was a heart transplant.
"If you'll excuse me, gentlemen..."
Emma.
"Please, it's Dr. Pierce."
I've been trying to reach you all day.
"Emma, listen."
The donor I talked to you about... her family is threatening to sue.
Her mother had religious objections... to harvesting her daughter's organs... even though her daughter was a voluntary donor.
"I don't think they have a case, but..."
Are you listening to me?
Her lawyer just called.
She needs to see you.
She needs to see how her daughter's cornea... has changed your life.
"Because it has, Emma."
"Whether you like it or not, it has."
Where does she live?
Is this Leslie's?
"You're Russian, you go to a Russian church?"
Yes.
"Um, Davisovich is our ancestral name."
Where did Leslie work?
Illinois Masonic... on Wellington.
- What are you looking for?
"- Her apartment is $2,500 a month."
"I lose $1,000 a night, every night that she does not work for me."
"I'm not paying you 1,000 a night."
Get real.
But something.
I need something.
I have expenses.
I'm not losing money.
Call me tomorrow.
I'll see what I have in the budget.
Watch yourself.
You're walking a very thin line.
"You, too."
I know what you get from my girls.
"Maybe this DEA guy, or whoever he is, is connected to these Americans."
You seriously think there's a conspiracy to take Jim out... so the American can take the drug trade over?
It's a $6 billion a year business.
"It's right in their backyard, which they can take a big piece of, by one simple move, getting rid of Jim."
I think you're smoking too much of what we're selling.
You always think everything is connected to everything else.
"'Cause that's how it really is, Ron."
Everything is connected.
It's coincidence.
"Random incidents, they come together, they line up so suddenly it looks like a pattern or a conspiracy."
- But it's just random.
- Just hear me out.
"Jim is the glue, he holds all these little pieces together."
"He leaves, there a big hole in the trade here."
What's that?
It's random.
It's a perfect storm and we're in the eye of it.
"Millington Associates are here to help."""
Not out of this office.
It could be worth your while.
I could cut you in.
No way.
"You need a Whizz, I need a Wii."
That's a perfect match.
Lovely melty car could be all yours.
All right.
But my cut comes off the top.
No more loud music and you make the coffee.
- Deal?
- Done!
Of course she's going to publish it herself.
"Well, she seemed very clear that she wasn't."
- And you believed her?
- That is neither here nor there.
"Legally, she can do what she likes."
Dr Goodyear's will leaves all the research to her.
Then we must contest the will.
"This is the curse of the ethical being, Peter."
The papers should be published.
They could be published if we had them.
Another man would simply take them and cut the Gordian knot in a moment.
- Uh...
"- And yet our own ethics, our code of conduct forces us to do nothing."
If only... if only there was another way!
There's the matter of you pulling your weight.
Time for Millington  Anderson to diversify.
"Anderson  Millington, and I've already had an idea, actually."
Free quotation on our will preparation service.
"This week only, no appointment necessary."
"Ok, look, look."
"I'm just gonna leave, all right, Dale?"
As long as I'm here this is not gonna end well.
"Just leave, ok?"
I bet you wanted that to happen didn't you?
"I'm seriously not following you, Hallie."
You really need to calm down.
You put on this little whoa is me act.
But I'm not buying it.
"Just because you throw yourself at every guy that's famous who you think can get you somewhere, and who you think wants you..."
"and then shoots you down, you know what, don't take that out on me, ok?"
You play the victim thing really well.
But it's a load of crap.
Shut up.
"You're not my... friend, Dale."
You're just like every other two-faced girl in L.A.
You just play it better.
"Come on, you guys."
This is retarded.
"What, you're just gonna take her side?"
"I'm not taking anybody's side, ok?"
"Come on, Hallie, let's go."
Don't touch me.
Did that really just happen?
This week on Dirty Roomies...
Would you clean this up.
I can't live like this.
I made the mess.
I don't know why I have to clean it up.
You guys have sex.
We have to do a paper edit on these and get them to run it.
The producers want to see it by Friday.
He is.
Best enjoy this while we can.
Hitler's got enough on his plate without picking a fight with us.
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?
If I can get away.
"- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam."
Turning out in force to oppose Joyce's proposition is the only way to get it thrown out.
"Will you be there, Alison?"
Of course.
Boxing gloves on.
Granite chin at the ready.
Excellent.
You may well need it.
I suspect it could get rather bloody.
How was the check-up?
Fine.
- Good.
"What can I get you, Alison?"
- Some tongue would be lovely.
"Oh, I was expecting you back half an hour ago, Claire."
"I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron."
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.
"And then, in the grocer's, a few of us were talking about tonight's meeting."
"As my employee, you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote in favour of my proposition tonight."
Staff loyalty is a quality that I hold in very high regard.
It's essential for a harmonious household.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
There's a list of chores on the kitchen table.
I'd like them completed by the time I return.
I'll be out all afternoon.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
"I just heard some sounds, like animals, and was..."
"Oh, call it natural curiosity."
"That's what got me into this business, I guess."
I'm just naturally curious.
"Well, I assure you, there is nothing here"
Nor any place else on my property that could
Interest you in the slightest.
I realize it's been difficult for you
With all that's happened.
Look here.
I don't like to see anyone die.
But I didn't know this Jeff boy at all.
Were he and your niece engaged?
Not really.
There wasn't a ring or anything.
Did he stay at her house?
He had his own apartment.
Suppose she stayed with them?
That would hardly be the behavior
I'd expect from my niece.
Check up on her very often?
Lord no.
"Since her mother's death, I've look in on her"
Once in a while just to see if I could help.
"Ms. Ramsey, this is a question I have to ask."
Do you know of anyone who would want Jeff Ingram dead?
I don't know anyone who even knew who he was.
"Now... well, except Audrey."
Does that answer your question?
"I know it's crazy, but it's the only thing"
That makes any sense.
"No, it doesn't."
"First, my wife."
Then her accomplice.
No.
No.
"No, Stan."
Forgive me.
"Lynn, wait."
Lynn!
"Lynn, wait."
"Lynn, don't run."
Come back.
Lynn!
Gordon.
Gordon.
Gordon.
I'm going to kill you.
Gordon.
Gordon.
Get me the police.
"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- Just a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."
I asked Temu to bring me here
"Mouna, I asked Temu to teach him"
"Even so, you cannot trespass into our Mehebu hunting ground"
This used to be our Toda hunting ground when my uncle was alive
You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us
Rob it back if you can
Enough!
"Mouna, can you do me this favor?"
Favor?
"Kojima... if you lived in Mehebu now,"
I'd do you this favor
But you live in Tnbarah Clan
Take these red-foot pheasants and get out of my hunting ground
I don't care if it's your hunting ground or theirs because everything here belongs to us Japanese now
"Temu, you just wait and see"
Some day I'll destroy your Tnbarah Clan
Go on and do it if you dare
Let's see who's killed first
I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo
"Wow, well done"
Can a girl carry such a heavy load?
Go!
Go!
Good girl!
"The men in your clan are all out hunting, aren't they?"
Wanna make some extra bucks?
- Come with me to my boardinghouse!
- No!
- I'll give you two dollars
- No!
What the hell?
Bastard!
You have clearance.
"- Just launching the search for that spy ship, sir."
- Good.
What's the position regarding the monorail?
The sapper team have laid 18 charges in the tunnel.
They can be detonated either simultaneously or independently.
I suppose Leitz will expect a medal after this.
"Surface launch, Master."
What did I say?
"Slave, can you identify them?"
The heat pattern indicates three B 19 cruisers.
"Oh, come on, Avon."
Hit that button.
"That's a search formation, Avon."
They're not aligned for an attack.
So they're searching.
We're going to wait here till they find us?
Let's get out.
"They must have picked up Dayna and Tarrant, and realised we are up here somewhere."
"Slave, set the ship on an evasion pattern, maximum speed!"
- That's the first sensible...
- Just a minute.
This is Scorpio.
"Come in, Tarrant."
"Hold that order, Slave."
TARRANT:
"Soolin, we're almost finished here."
"Tell him if he doesn't get the hell out, we're certainly finished here."
SOOLIN:
"Tarrant, we think Scorpio has been spotted."
Teleport up now.
"I'm sorry, Soolin, we're not receiving you very clearly."
More light and light it grows!
"More light and light, more dark and dark our woes."
- Madam!
- What is it?
Your mother is soon coming to your chamber.
The day is here.
Be careful and make haste.
I shall be gone.
Your parents cannot know that I have been part of this deceit.
"Farewell, my love."
"One more kiss, and I'll descend."
No.
Come this way.
I'll teach Benvolio to learn your news each day.
"No, more than that."
Each hour in each day.
Each minute in each hour is a day for pining lovers.
And amen to that.
Do you believe we'll ever meet again?
I do not doubt it.
Nor that we shall smile to think of all these troubles in the past.
If God would only free me of foreboding.
"I think I see you, now you are below, as dim and pale as dead men in their tombs."
"So are you dim, love, in dawn's drab light."
Our worries make us pale.
So adieu.
"Oh, fortune, fortune, all men call you fickle because no fortune ever constant be."
"If that is so, then change again, oh, fortune."
Be fickle now and send him back to me.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Please, Benvolio, be a guardian angel to my love."
Watch her firmly and gently as it would do the eye of God.
I can't afford that.
"Afford it you will, Mr. Newman or this court will see that your car is impounded and sold at auction."
"Well, don't you worry, Your Honour."
He's in my custody.
"Well, what do you think?"
I really can't say.
"- No, say."
I want you to say.
"- It's not good, okay?"
It's not good.
You look stupid.
I'm sorry.
You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
I really think this looks pretty good.
"Why not get white shoes, move to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
Maybe you could show me something else.
"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you."
But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
"Oh, hey."
I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.
You make it difficult for your friend to improve his life.
I'm preventing him from becoming one of those guys people snicker at because they look ridiculous.
No offence to you personally.
You people with hair think you're so superior.
You have no idea what it's like.
You ever look in the tub and see a fistful of hair?
Start your day with that!
All right.
Take it easy.
I just have to...
I just have to...
"Oh, God!"
-
- What have I done?
-
- What have you done?
It's time for a bit of advanced training.
I've got to get a bit of steel into you.
It's no good g--going through life laying back and letting things happen to you... like your mother used to!
"Oh, 'eck!"
I've been sweeping round these things for two years!
"Why don't you give up on these, eh?"
You're never gonna get rid of these.
Who's gonna buy these?
Don't worry about them.
They're too advanced for you.
Stick to basics like how the h--hell you're gonna pay for that ice cream.
"You know, you can't just drag people into the shop."
This is not dragging 'em in.
It's propelling 'em in this direction as if by accident.
-
"- All right, show me."
-
- You've seen me do it often enough.
I've always been too embarrassed to watch.
It's not a case of embarrassment.
It's a test of skill.
"Well, I hope this section never gets published in me biography."
"I'm warning you, if ever I become famous, well, one day, I want absolutely no reference to this."
I see.
"Ashamed of it, are you?"
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allow Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for strategic reasons is information you might want to lose on your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Yeah, well, it does seem your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
"Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner, not Simmonds."
- Have you seen that film?
- What film?
The Untouchables.
"Great film, it's a great film."
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"""They put one of ours in the hospital, we put one of theirs in the morgue. """
- Right.
- lain?
A light's just come on in the car.
It's like a green explanation mark.
- Probably needs a service.
- It's brand-new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
You want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
What's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
I quit because I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't work those hours anymore.
"But I felt he was always an honorable... thoroughly honorable guy, except for the way he treated the women in his life."
"And that was not honorable, but..."
Do you remember thinking about that?
"I mean, how the women took it?"
"I did, because I was married, had a wife, two children."
"And I knew what that was like, and I knew... that's when I... that's when I finally quit."
"For the last time, I came home and... my Estelle was crying, and she said, ""We never see you."""
"And I said, ""Oh, that's it."
I can't...
"Can't do it anymore."""
"But he just could juggle people's lives, and it didn't bother him."
I don't understand it.
I don't know how he could do it.
I don't know how he had the mental strength for it.
It would have...
I would have had a breakdown.
But he didn't.
He was such a tough guy.
"He really was tough as hell, you know, I mean..."
- Mentally.
- In what way?
"Well, how could he juggle three or four lives like that?"
Lou was very secretive.
He liked to keep his business to himself.
"And he'd call and say,"
"""You know where I am, but nobody else is to know where I am."""
"And I'd say, ""Okay,"""
because they would call looking for him.
- Who would call?
"- Esther would call Saturdays and Sundays, or Anne Tyng would call."
"Did that not occur to you?"""
"She said, ""I didn't-- I didn't realize that."""
I swear that's how she talks.
"""I didn't realize that."""
"I was like, ""That's 'cause you mixed."
"""Okay, you're Black and white."
"""You don't have survival skills, you don't."
"Mm-mm."" She don't."
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.
"Had it been like a Black chick from the hood,"
"Brooklyn, something--hey!"
"She would've been in the water with a pistol, just swimming around, you know what I'm talking about?"
Now she would have been doggy-paddling.
But she would have been swimming around.
"She would have been in the drink just like this,"
"""I will fuck a shark up."
"""Don't you touch my baby."
"""Somebody gotta pay for the hotel room."
"I ain't doing the shit."""
"And she would've had her head up like this the whole time, so her hair didn't get wet."
She's my baby.
Back to Kanye West though.
"Called me up, he was like,"
"""And, you know, I didn't call you up"
"""to, you know, knock your craft or, you know, anything,"
"""because it would be weird for me to call up"
"Richard Pryor or Jamie Foxx or one of the greats."""
"I'm like, ""Richard Pryor's dead."
He's dead.
"You can't--you can't call him."""
This is what I'm thinking in my head the whole time.
"Okay, I'm listening to this man talk about himself for 11 minutes straight."
- Thank you.
And I also noticed a certain linguistic similarity with Bennet's recent work.
Well...
- That's...
"- Carrie, I'm not an idiot."
I know you wrote the parachute pants piece for him.
I just...
I really wanted to help Bennet out.
Stop worrying about Bennet.
Think about yourself.
Because this piece is going in the magazine under your name.
Mouse!
Have you seen Pete?
"Uh, no."
I thoughouyou guys were hanging out today.
"Well, we were supposed to."
"And then this morning, he called while I was out and told me my mom that he's leaving tonight."
And now I can't find him anywhere.
"Okay, don't panic."
I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.
Why'd I let you convince me to scare him off with my onion breath and my hairy legs?
"We were just trying to help, so you wouldn't make the same mistakes you kept making in the past."
"Great, well, now you helped me right out of a boyfriend."
"It's not too late, you know, to make your own mistakes."
How would I do that?
"Well, he took the bus here, right?"
So go down to the bus station and wait for him there.
And tell him what?
Whatever your instincts tell you to say.
"Oh, God."
That's probably my dad.
"Hey, Bennet."
Nami's not after money.
- She did it because she trusted me.
- So you say.
Your image is very appealing.
"And you have such a nice body, too."
Nowadays there is not much excitement in this industry.
It's so boring.
Did you give my number to anyone?
Why?
I've been getting a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
Is there a pervert stalking you?
"Such a lonely world, isn't it?"
Everyone wants someone to talk to.
That sad looking guy outside as well.
He looks like a guy who's henpecked at home.
Are you sympathizing with a pervert!
?
"No, but I read these stories in the magazines so often nowadays, how some women have been assaulted or had their underwear stolen."
Do you have a persecution complex?
You might be the type.
I think I'll be going now.
"OK, I understand."
Why don't you take that magazine with you as a memento?
"Ladies and gentlemen, this train is leaving, please mind the doors,"
Nami Tsuchiya.
Please come out.
I just want to talk to you.
Who are you?
Say something.
I saw you in front of the cafe.
Why did you follow me?
"I sympathize with you, and I don't know why I'm doing this."
- You went home with that guy?
"- Uh, is that fair?"
- Did you sleep with him?
That's all I want to know.
"Uh, you don't actually want to know."
I was gonna talk to Michelle.
I was gonna...
You know what?
Forget it.
- What?
Chad!
Don't...
"- Don't call me, all right?"
Oh.
So last night was about making someone else jealous.
- I don't know.
"- Well, it obviously worked."
You almost have to love the irony.
You're where I was a few months ago.
"You ended things with me, Scotty."
Now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn't love himself.
I feel sorry for you.
"Good luck, Kevin."
It's just a travesty.
"I mean, what has this city come to when the police are arresting two little old... two mature women, and throwing them in jail for the night?"
Maybe if you had shown some maturity and not resisted arrest...
I never resisted...
No one ever re...
Wouldn't my tax dollars be better spent arresting drug dealers or bangers?
Gang bangers.
Maybe you shouldn't be so judgmental now that you have a record.
Any chance of you not telling your siblings about this?
"I'm not taking any time off, I swear."
"Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then."
- It is?
"- Yeah, absolutely."
"In fact, coffee preparation is very important."
Yeah.
"Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb..."
That's great.
"Listen to me, I need to ask you something."
"The other day when I said those things to you about taking time off, I mean, I don't even know"
- if you remember it.
- Like it was yesterday.
"Well, in that case I was just wondering... how bad was I?"
You weren't that bad.
Good.
"Now, would you be willing to swear to that in court?"
- What?
Why?
- No reason.
"Truth is, my recollection is exactly the same as yours."
"You asked for a couple days off, and I gave it to you."
"See, I even wrote it in my diary."
"""Gave Brian two days off."
"Felt good about it."""
It looks like you just wrote that today.
- What makes you say that?
- It has today's date on top.
I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.
Can I go back to work now?
"Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible."
"Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph."
"I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo, my interest was piqued."
"- Yeah, we have a great blooper reel."
- My God.
I wanna see it so badly.
- Click on over.
- Stop this commentary immediately.
"- Hey, that was my hand."
- Kat Dennings does her own inserts.
Because nobody else can do it right.
"I don't think that my hand acting in the scene with the toilet ended up in there, right?"
That was cut?
"- No, your hand is..."
- When she looks in the hole and my hand goes over it.
"- No, that didn't make it."
- They cut that out.
- That didn't make it.
"- God, your fault, so hard."
If anyone's gonna get raped in that van...
And this is so...
This gets a huge laugh.
"Sorry, I told you I didn't think that rape line was gonna work."
Yeah.
"No, it's fine."
Did you tell me that night?
"Yeah, because you guys started bringing the scene in..."
You started to re-create the scene and it was going really well but then that rape line I thought was never gonna work.
It was never gonna play funny.
But it's one of the biggest laughs in the film.
I think that some people definitely won't like it.
So I think your instinct was...
- I was playing it safe.
"- Well, rape isn't a joke, Michael."
- What'd you say?
No.
They're not funny at all!
"Oh, hello Dick."
- Hello Ben.
I'm waiting for Mary.
I'm sleeping with Mary.
Oh.
Okay.
"So from what I've heard, you're quite the professor funnypants."
"Well, I.."
- It's seems that you have Mary wrapped around your little funny bone.
"But I can assure you, I am a far tougher... bone wrapperer"
I think I'll wait outside.
Make me laugh funny man.
"Well, I'm not a comedian."
"It's just that funny things, just seem to happen to me."
"Oh really, like what?"
"Well, like last week, I was at a bus stop, and it suddenly started raining, pouring."
"And I look over and I see this gorgeous grad student, and she's looking at me, like a kid with braces, looking at a candy apple."
"Mmm, no, not funny."
"Well, I'm about to say hello, when I suddenly realize, that my hair has flipped forward."
"Here I am standing in the rain, with my very own awning."
"Well, finally the bus arrived, and the door opened, the compressor kicked in, and this, this, European weave of mine got sucked right into the bus!"
"Well, there I was, in front of this beautiful girl, and chasing that bus, and chasing my hair.."
"up and down, chasing!"
And I couldn't..
I just.. oh!
Oh!
Oh!
This is not good.
"Yes, Yes, it is!"
The bus stole your hair!
-Shh!
- I can't hear anything.
-Quiet.
Logopolis has stopped.
And I was vain enough to think it was me he was after.
Logopolis is his target.
Turn that machine off.
You have no idea what you're doing.
"Merely emitting a sound-cancelling wave, Monitor."
Logopolis is now temporarily suspended.
The silence gives us an opportunity to discuss its future.
There will be no future.
"You are eroding structure, generating entropy."
An absurd assertion.
I know the power of this device down to the last decibel.
But you do not know Logopolis!
"But I shall, shan't I?"
When you tell me of the secret work you're doing here.
I cannot tell you.
Why have you created a copy of the Pharos Project?
"Hmm, the time has come for you to share your secret with me."
No!
No one must know.
That has been our firm decision.
"Very well, we'll wait until you change it."
Patience is a particular virtue of mine.
Father.
That's not your father.
"Tremas is dead, murdered by him, the Master."
Nyssa.
You killed my father?
But his body remains useful.
I'm going to tell you something.
Tendo wasn't a dumb fuck like you.
The first thing he is expecting is a strike right now.
So we count his hit as a pay back.
"Let's get back to business, huh?"
No!
Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again.
We let things cool down.
We let things cool down.
We find out when tendo goes back to Japan.
We find out who the fuck the American is he has working for him.
"Ok, once we got this information, then what?"
Then we call in our connections.
And we blow them off the face of the fucking earth.
This is Tony's.
Sam?
Sam?
"Man, what took you so long?"
I'm freezing my nuts off here.
"I didn't pick this place, tell it to the captain."
"No, you tell it to the captain."
Man he is mad as hell at you!
For what?
You get sent undercover and the next thing he knows San Pedro looks like v-8 juice.
What the hell happened this time?
Tendo is in town.
Campanela found out and tried to knock him off.
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Are you talking about me, Sam?"
"Shit yeah, I'm talking about you."
You're supposed to be helping us bring these guys down.
Why?
I don't know!
"I was with Jonesy, and we were just looking Felix up on the net, just a something to do."
And his family was so stinking rich.
They just wound me up!
"People like me have to duck and die, for these blue-blood types have got it all!"
"It was just a laugh, you know?"
A little note to remind him that he wasn't so important after all!
"Not that he felt that way, as it turns out."
- You utter prick.
"- Oh, it was just a postcard!"
How was I supposed to know he'd bloody kill himself?
You couldn't have known.
He must have been unstable... like his brother.
It wasn't your fault.
See?
- Did you do that?
- Let go of me.
- Truth!
Did you do that to him?
- He did it to himself.
"I sat by him for days, weeks."
I knew that he was still alive inside.
"I knew that he'd be ashamed of what he did, ashamed of his weakness."
I knew that he'll tell me who's to blame
"Imagine being like Felix... paralysed, powerless!"
You'd hurt whoever you could!
You wanted Felix to name names.
We were the last people to piss him off.
But it doesn't justify his suicide.
And it doesn't justify this revenge.
Perhaps you're right.
You want to go on pretending to be the brother he's never heard of?
We were getting somewhere.
Then get somewhere honestly.
As his father.
Honesty?
Is that what this is?
"You just want me to make good with my FBI agent son so he doesn't go tell them about it and they come close this little science project, and then bam!"
There goes your cure.
I know you didn't throw yourself off that bridge.
Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard would never walk off that bridge.
Damn straight he wouldn't.
But Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ended up all by himself in a crappy apartment paying for hookers.
Watch it.
And getting visits from his son only when the neighbors complained about the noise and cigarette smoke.
He knows who you are.
Show him who you can be.
I've seen that person.
"I think Duval should see him, too."
You done?
Yes.
You ever think about coaching sports?
That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.
There's only one way back into Duval's life.
He asked me for help once.
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.
"And when he asked for your help, what did you do?"
Gracie:
"Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here."
[Chuckles]
Does my dad know you're here?
"No, he doesn't."
"You know, I'm not a kid."
I'm going into a new business.
Only this afternoon I made $200.
$200?
"Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding."
That makes it a little different.
I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money.
It shows character.
"- That's too kind of you, sir."
- Not at all.
Then Margaret and I can get married?
If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret.
"Oh, Daddy."
And in all probability I'll be very happy to give her to you.
"Right, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
"John, dear."
"You'll come back soon, won't you?"
"That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks..."
"Goodbye, my son."
"Thank you, father-in-law."
I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you.
"Hurry back, dear."
I feel that I'm a little to blame in this.
"You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were."
"And I don't care how big the city, I feel confident... you're going to be successful."
"Thank you, sir."
"Lucky, couldn't I go with you?"
I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me.
"No, honest I wouldn't."
I'm terrible bad when you get to know me.
Then I wouldn't want you to come with me.
"One to New York, please."
"""He was so pleased that he held our hands tightly..."
"""and did not want to let go for quite some time."
"""But he was very disappointed that Grandma did not come."
"""He repeatedly asked us what was wrong with her..."
"""and we didn't know how to answer him."
"""Since Grandma had said no..."
"""we came to see Suzujiro on her behalf..."
"""which was the wrong thing to do."
"""We are her blood relatives..."
"""but after all, we are actually strangers as far as Suzujiro is concerned."
"""The person he really wanted to see was the Ione survivor..."
"""his sister, Grandma."
"""We can't do her job."
"""Suzujiro, who had kept his eyes closed for a while..."
"""opened them, and said:"
"""'Grandma might as well come to see him..."
"""'with her grandchildren during summer vacation.'"
"""He said, 'We would feel easier that way.'"
"""It's a good idea, please do what he said."""
-Going to....
-To Hawaii.
"""I also think it's a good idea."
"""Grandma, please think it over again."
"""A trip to Hawaii is not too different..."
"""from a trip between Nagasaki and Tokyo, where our home is."""
That's right!
"""I also beg your favor."
"""please come to Hawaii with your four grandchildren..."
"""and meet Suzujiro."
"""With hasty regards, Tadao."""
"Grandma, it's a very good idea!"
"You should go, absolutely."
I found it.
You'd better look your intern ass I found it!
And I found something along with it too:
"Errors, major ones."
Errors that we cannot afford to make.
- Like what?
"- Honey... we are not at ""Harper's Bazaar""."
The big boss down the hall would not be thrilled.
She'd be very glad that I had a spare moment... to oversee this...
"this ""work""."
"I delegated this project to you because I thought you could... handle it, unfortunately, I've learned you can't."
"Re-typing my rolodeck was just that difficult task for you, huh?"
For example:
Lann Wayner's card.
"Why is there only one ""n""on lann?"
"Did you know he added an extra ""n"" years ago?"
"Andy Warhol's card, did you even think to verify this number?"
"- No, because he's dead."
- Excuses!
"You just don't get it, do you?"
"Dead or alive, I still... need their phone numbers."
"This is for your own benefit, not mine, okay?"
No bad blood?
It's curse!
Dolly!
You're back from the couture show!
How is Lacroix?
"That is Dolly Bellows, she's an institution."
- Give me a tissue.
- That man is a genius!
The word genius is really in overuse
Lacroix transcends the English language.
- This in an eight and a half.
- Nothing for Sylvie?
No.
We don't have the coral in an eight and a half.
So I brought the taupe and the black.
And this is a similar style in ivory with a strap.
"Oh, I don't want the strap."
I didn't think you would.
I just wanted you to see it.
"Yeah, I would just feel silly with the strap."
I'm a grown woman.
"Well, sure."
But I'm contractually obligated... to at least try to sell you shoes.
How are the boys?
Are you guys all settled in there?
My boys are great.
They're great at being boys.
Kids are so adaptable.
- Am I adaptable?
- Yes.
"Yes, well... they have absolutely no control over their own lives, so-"
"But if things were reversed... you know, like that movie Freaky Friday... you can be sure Pam and I would be sent to our rooms for all our fighting."
"Yes, they would give us a time-out... and tell us we could not come out until we had really thought about what we had done."
What have we done?
But... there are no time-outs.
There's not enough time fortime-out.
"Is the sale just for clothes, or is it for other things too?"
It's a storewide sale.
"Fifteen minutes, Sylvie."
How do they feel?
Where are the Braun handheld blenders... that were advertised in the Sunday supplement?
- Is it a classic instrument?
One minute.
"Give us a minute, Okay?"
Does it hurt?
They gave me some aspirin.
"Enjoy it, because it's the last fucking drug you'll ever take."
"-I'm sorry, T."
-Shut the fuck up and listen to me.
"You're my nephew, Christopher, and I love you."
That's the only reason you're alive right now.
"If it were anybody else, anybody... they would've had their intervention through the back of their head."
"You and me, we're close."
We've done a lot of things for each other.
That cop shot my father.
"I know what you're telling me, I'll never forget that."
This is how you repay me.
I gotta worry if you'll flip over a nickel bag of white powder.
"-No, Tony, never."
-You lied to me.
"I told you, you were the future of this family."
I gave you that responsibility.
"And you looked me in the eye, and you accepted it... and you were fucking high."
Shut up.
Tomorrow morning I gotta go with Patsy up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.
You're going in.
You're staying in.
"You'll go to every session, and you'll keep your mouth shut."
"Now, if you need anything, anything at all..."
Patsy's going to be half a mile away from you... in a motel.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
-Do you understand?
"-Tony, I'm sorry!"
How did I fucking get to this?
He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
"Run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us."
We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.
Why are you still here?
You're being cautious.
You're being... common.
When you don't give a crap about... how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?
Let me know when that happens.
Then we can have this conversation.
"It's just another case, huh?"
"Gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing."
"Boy, I wish I had your job."
Biopsy showed nothing.
How can there be nothing?
You cut out a piece of my brain.
It's nothing personal.
We just didn't find anything.
Can you up his morphine for god's sake?
"He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour."
What about toxins?
Everything was negative.
There was a cupboard above the stove.
Did you see it?
"I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis."
We didn't go back.
Follow right.
Who did?
House said we shouldn't go.
Too dangerous.
The answer's gotta be in that apartment.
Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
I say that even now.
But how did you remember all this?
I'm caught.
It was a lie.
Coming to Malaysia for your treatment?
A naked lie.
You made us fools?
"You're right, that was true."
I hate people who act like you.
Aren't you acting?
"Though I am in your heart, you're getting ready to get engaged with someone else."
Isn't that an act?
I acted saying that I don't remember past.
And you are acting without saying that.
Not much of a difference.
Happy moments I spent with you are more important for me.
You think of our separation.
You forget things which you should remember.
Don't cheat yourself.
Is she telling me to go away?
Is she telling me to come?
What is your heart saying?
Do you know that at least?
You storm me like a tornado...
I suffocate because of you...
In such circumstances...
Is it possible to know what my heart says?
Roaring forever...
The clouds won't hide the water vapour and carry that burden...
"Like you, it won't hide its love..."
If you had embraced me with your warmth... my youth would have jumped in joy...
If you had struck the right notes...
"Say, uh, hey, Billy, look up there."
See that building up there?
That's where your mother and I went to high school.
"[woman] Do you see it, Billy?"
"Remember, I told you those stories?"
Yeah.
"Hey, well my dad's a professor at Princeton."
"Oh, yeah, great."
"Well, he's not exactly a full professor."
"[woman] Anyway, I really wanted to go to New york."
"And then after I was there a while,"
"I don't know, I kind of wanted to come home again."
"Even when I went to New York to visit you, I missed it."
"It's not that I didn't have a good time, but, uh, this is really home."
[woman] I know exactly what you mean.
"Like, do you remem-- well, you probably don't remember when I won that silly contest, Miss, um-- oh, what was the-- miss Orange Blossom?"
"Yeah, um, Orange Growers Association."
How did you remember the name of that contest?
"Listen, I took your picture for the paper, remember?"
"As a matter of fact, that's when I started to fall in love with you."
"You look terrific, Billy."
"Yeah, a real cowboy."
"Right, mom?"
"Very funny, get in the car."
You're hard to please.
"Try to be nice to him, Billy."
"Okay, I'll try."
That's my pal.
Here you go.
"We're going into gold mine country, full of claim jumpers."
You're going to need that.
"That's the same kind of gun that William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, used in 1875 when he shot it out with the James Boys."
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.
Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know, Mr. Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water, where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right, Mr. Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea, it's that right Mr. Madsen?"
"If you know, why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring, right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well, you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
"I know all about the new lag, the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
One goes another comes
All of you burn in hell
What is iy my Bey?
What happened?
Who's this girl?
I don't know.
I don't know her
Brave woman though
Let me take you to the council of poets
"If there's the Aşık(lover) Çelebi, he'd say your future to your face"
Maybe there's another woman in your destiny
Fortunately you are here
I'm always lonely here all day long
Our Paşa is very busy
He can't dedicate much time to you
I have no complaints
It is enough that he is here with me
I wish our baby borned immediately
It is almost over my Sultana
"You'll take have it on your laps soon, inşallah"
Amen
Welcome my Paşa
You too
"Nigar, put this on my table"
I need a ware of this cruel person that he always uses
With your permission I'll go wash my face
It is too hot
Have a seat.
Tell us what you did today
Bring me a cold drink
I'm about to faint
What's that in your hand?
"Apparently, you can't say he's got a vagina."
Ohh!
"Fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you've got to tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Who, Kenneth?"
He just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group.
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Attaboy.
"Chumley, the beverage situation around here is reprehensible."
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
"Surely, our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee."
"Yeah, or, like, a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you want to go get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh, I need to change your Michael Jackson thing."
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out."
"[High-pitched voice] So, President Bush is in the news again."
"No, Jay Leno."
"The host of ""The Tonight Show."""
[Normal voice] That's what I was doing.
"[High-pitched voice] So, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars, you know?"
"No, no, like Jay Leno."
"[High-pitched voice] Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
[High-pitched voice] Have you ever noticed when you eat a lot of cheese...
"Excuse me, but what is your deal?"
I rather not discuss it.
- Why not?
"- That's my business, that's why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'd send professionals.
They did!
Then why is it matter what I don't want to discuss?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
- We got ammo.
- Then let's get this show on the road.
Expecting company.
- What kind of company?
"- Rather not say, except to say we probably don't wanna be here when they arrived."
- They?
"Who's ""they""?"
- Is this an interview or a hit?
Whatever man.
You got anymore cookies?
"Maybe, maybe not."
"How about this, if you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are,"
- and I'll throw in the recipe.
- How are you gonna do that dead?
- Start shooting and find out.
- Hardy har har.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague."
- Again?
"- Yea, again."
Don't worry I won't move this time.
"I'll be right here, when you get back."
"I know we gotta off this guy, cos that's what we gotta do."
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I'll run it!
[Regan humming]
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
"She shows all the symptoms-- hyperactivity, quick temper, performance in math."
"Yeah, why the math?"
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Uh-huh.
Now this is for ritalin.
10 milligrams a day.
Is it like a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
The condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"As to how or why, we really don't know."
But the symptoms could be overreaction to depression.
That's out of my field.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
Do you think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
- Same here.
- So... who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
"No, I wasn't talking about me, actually."
Jonathan here mentioned a woman that he was dating that was very lively?
- Lively.
- Really?
You've got an awfully good grip.
"It's probably kind of handy in bed, isn't it?"
How orgasmic was she?
Thank you about the grip.
"Yeah, I... she was..."
- I don't want to be rude.
- I don't mind talking about sex.
It's what everybody's thinking about anyway.
Why don't we sit down and have a drink and be civilized?
"I'd love to, but we actually were on our way out right now."
So maybe some other time.
"So anyway, hello and goodbye."
Nice to meet you.
That was really weird... the way Antrem wouldn't let go of my hand.
He's a strange and tormented creature.
It really disturbs me that Priscilla loved me once and now loves him.
I'd hate to think what that means.
They're very nice ladies.
"Well, one of them is."
I'd be doing them a huge favor.
I don't feel good about this.
I don't want you to be a sperm donor.
But it's flattering.
They're fans of my work.
I've never had lesbian fans before.
They should go to a sperm bank.
"Hey, you think if I keep telling myself it's over,"
I'll actually believe it?
You'll be sorry if it's over.
No more running around crazy in the streets with roguishly handsome me.
Have you always found yourself so entertaining?
Come on.
Admit it.
I amuse the stuffing out of you.
My stuffing's perfectly in place.
You know what I'll miss?
Knowing what's gonna happen.
It made me feel... godlike.
That's nothing new for you.
"Well, I, guess I'll see you next time the universe decides to break all its rules on your behalf."
"Yeah, next time."
Goodbye.
Nico.
Yeah?
What did the guy do?
What guy?
"On the video, the one that got you kicked off the force?"
"In the modern world, there's nowhere to hide, is there?"
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't...
- It was a meth factory... in a house in El Sobrante.
Guy just... escaped a cooking accident.
Place went up in a fireball.
Too bad his girlfriend and kid that he left behind did not survive the inferno.
Too bad for my career with the police department
I let my... my disapproval of his behavior get the better of me.
"If it were me, I wouldn't have been kicked off the force for assaulting him."
- No?
How could I?
I didn't hold a grudge against you either.
I could never hold a grudge against you.
- How's life?
Are you happy?
- I am.
Happy that you became a famous artist.
What you always wanted... and what you truly deserved to be.
"Yet, I often wondered if this is worth of being alone in life."
"'Artists should never get married,' eh?"
Remember?
I always do.
"Everything was so beautiful then, the penthouse..."
the hole in the blanket!
The pot with our one and only sovereign!
I broke the pot and the sovereign was counterfeit.
Counterfeit?
The sovereign we swore on our love never to spend was... counterfeit!
"But our love was real, Pavlos."
And my portrait?
what became of my portrait?
"It's the only thing I have from you, Aliki."
I never sold this portrait.
"It's always been in the penthouse, over my bed."
When I feel lonely...
disheartened...
I talk to that portrait as if it was alive and listening.
"I tell her... my dreams, my worries, my bitter sorrows..."
Whatever I say... she'll always answer...
I love you!
"I love you, too!"
"We lost track of time, Pavlos."
You make me laugh!
We make him laugh.
"well, you two are starting to worry us."
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
"You were chosen because you were 76-/- average, and after just a few days, you,re barely 44-/- average."
I was about to tell you:
"If you don,t stay above 50-/-, you won,t be here long."
"We,re not above 50-/-?"
"We,re not making this up."
"Think of your country, of yourselves, of everything we,ve done."
"It,d be a terrible waste."
"They,II make us pay for everything, just you wait!"
- Is that supposed to be irony?
"- Why, is it forbidden?"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Do you think you,re doing this all by yourself?"
Have you any idea what we must deal with?
Sometimes I wonder why we bother.
I thought scientists were much more patient.
At work we deal with relationships and statistics -
"Check 7 under ,aggressiveness.,"
"You,d put 7?"
",Check 7., There you go again!"
You want aggressiveness?
Let me handle this.
- Maybe 8.
"- Right, check 8."
Your colleague said 8.
Check that.
"Note, ,The couple find the technicians very amusing.,"
"personally, I,m very tired, and right now I really don,t find this amusing."
"Anything you can do for that, uh, for that little baby, please, do it."
"I'll get out of your hair right now, okay ?"
I'll come find you.
"I'll be right there, all right ?"
Okay.
Thank you.
"Yes, of course."
You feel that ?
Darryl ?
"Hey, Seth."
How's the earthquake treating you ?
"Uh, not too well."
I need to ask for your help.
"Sure, but how can I help you ?"
"Well, I'm guessing you don't have a, uh, like, a car or a walkie-talkie ?"
This shopping cart's my only worldly possession.
"Okay, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for it."
"Sorry, no way."
I'll give you my pants.
"No, no, they look better on you."
Listen.
"It has a flat tire and possibly a broken axle, but it's a $70,000 car and it's all yours in exchange for the cart."
Sweet.
"Stay here, I'll come back to draw you a map."
Because... it's a rabbit.
"It's a he, and I'm aware of his species."
but that doesn't mean that he doesn't feel pain and that he isn't hurt.
"Please, if you have a shred of humanity, or animality in your body, you won't deprive this poor, little, adorable bunny of quality medical care."
"Well, I did do a year of veterinarian school."
Really ?
"Maybe if there's an X-ray machine free, I'll..."
Thank you.
"Once when India attained freedom, and today.."
..when my friend has become successful.
"I dont understand something, Dhanraj."
You want to buy Mr. Kumars mansion.
"And I want to sell it, in orderto.."
..get my money back..
- Right.
Then why dont you give me the..
..money and take the mansion?
Why are you conducting this auction?
You dont understand.
"When the house gets auctioned, then the.."
..dignity of the members of the house gets ruined.
There is a saying in Gujarati that if you want to show..
"..your rivalry, then you should see to it that your.."
..enemy becomes a pauper completely so that..
..he begs and doesnt mess with you again.
Ravi!
Vicky!
"Ravi, did you hear?"
Our house is getting auctioned!
"Why are you so shocked, sister-in-Iaw?"
This would happen some orthe other day.
will you.. will you let this heaven-Iike..
..house of yours get auctioned?
Vicky..
"Vicky, this house is notjust.."
"..made up of lime, sand and stones.."
..but your brothers hard work is also involved in this!
And.. and where will we go if we leave this house!
?
Now everyone will have to arrange forthemseIves.
Tony's.
"You know Tony, sir."
He's the one who...
"If you tell me that one more time, I'm gonna kill myself."
"Sorry, sir."
Have I said that before?
"So the number of people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night,"
"her secretary,"
"Mr. Sid Daley,"
Mark...
I'm curious as to how Mark knew.
"Well, sir, Mark offered to bring her a cheeseburger and she told her secretary to tell him that she not only didn't want a gofer, she didn't want a cheeseburger, either."
And that she was going to get a sandwich over at Tony's.
And she said to tell her husband the same thing.
I see.
"Well, no you don't, sir."
"I mean, you must have seen before."
"Because you were in the room when she took the call, werert you?"
She made it from this dressing room.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I'm not in the habit of listening to other people's telephone calls.
I didn't know that Claire was going to Tony's.
"You didn't, sir?"
"Absolutely not, Lieutenant."
"Then how did you know, sir, that there were only four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night and how did you know that you were one of them?"
The same way you did.
I asked Claire's secretary and she informed me that the call was made from my room.
"You did, sir?"
"Oh, yes, I did, Lieutenant."
"Oh, that's very good, sir."
"Thank you, Lieutenant."
"Yeah, you want to grab One of those samples, sam?"
Yeah.
Zeke tenhoff and his brother sam.
"Are assessing the fruits Of their day's labor,"
As they work to secure A mineralrights.
Claim on the grounds.
With the state of alaska.
"Yeah, this is the sample That was from, like,"
Far away from the hole As I could get.
My immediate goal For the start of this ice season.
Is to collect enough samples To be able to prove.
That there is A longterm resource of gold.
Out at that prehistoric Beach line at hastings creek.
"Once I have that data, I can start."
"The claiming And leasing process,"
To have unrestricted access To the area for the longterm.
"I hate to be the pessimist,"
But this just looks like A bucket full of sand to me.
I do kinda wish maybe I was Panning from samples.
"That were full of red And black sand,"
Instead of just old Prehistoric pebbles.
It's in here.
I mean...
Okay.
We got one tiny little speck.
It's right there.
Speck of gold.
Tiny little speck of fine gold.
That's not gonna Pay the bills.
It's not gonna pay the bills.
"The first samples that I was Able to take, not looking good."
"I mean, by brother's not happy."
"""Nobody walk around with your shoes off."""
Are you sure?
"When I heard the glass break, I immediately threw on my bathing suit."
Was that for nothing?
Where's the glass?
Yay!
"Get these ""save the dates"" for people's weddings."
You guys know what I'm talking about.
"The ""save the dates."""
When did this start?
Why did this start?
"Why was someone like, ""You know what?"
"In advance of the invitation, let's send our friends a ""save the date,' as to say, ""Psst!"
Heads up.
Invitation on the way.
You're one of the chosen ones.
That's right.
Identical information on both pieces of paper.
"Except on that save the date, you're gonna get a pretty cool, insecure picture of the two of us."
That's a magnet.
Put that on the fridge.
"Decorate your home with our faces.'"""
"You see those pictures, you're like, ""Oh, fuck."
"I can't go to this."""
"They're just looking at you like, ""This is what love is, right?"
"We're in a field in the middle of nowhere, standing next to an abandoned barn."
Come to our wedding.
Look at us.
"We're spooning backwards while standing, laughing about something one of us brought up."
Be at our wedding!
"Look, we're on a dock in the middle of a lake."
We don't even live near a lake.
- That's the husband.
Get Psych down here.
- Can my wife go home now?
- Not yet.
"What, you moved Judy out of the trauma room."
I thought that meant she was good to go.
We needed to clear the room.
"We have to rule out a cardiac contusion, so we need to monitor her heart some more to make sure it's not bruised."
For how long?
I'm not sure.
It could be a while.
Mr. Anderson... does Judy drink alcohol?
No.
"I mean, she has a glass of wine now and then."
Why?
What about drugs?
What's this all about?
"Just routine questions for her chart to avoid any drug interaction, that sort of thing."
Have you noticed any change in her mood lately?
Like what?
She seem depressed?
Any loss of appetite or trouble sleeping?
"You're kidding, right?"
We have a three- month-old baby.
"When Gracie doesn't sleep, none of us do."
"Look, the sooner I can get them both home, the sooner they can start getting better."
I don't want to send her home until I'm sure there's no danger.
"No, of course, you're right."
Thank you.
"Dr. Kovac, could you help me clear some beds?"
I thought I was.
"Well, maybe if we work together."
The vice president is scheduled to preside over a Senate vote today on President Sawyer's controversial Middle East peace plan.
"Then tomorrow, the vote will go to Congress."
Republicans and Democrats have indicated they will vote along party lines but some members have indicated that they may cross over.
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.
Carol.
He wants to do the thing.
- Really?
- Really.
"Mr. President, it isn't a good idea to deviate from the flight plan."
"Pretty please, Carol?"
"Leader of the free world saying ""pretty please""?"
That ought to count for something.
"Captain Johns, we are going to deviate from Route Omaha."
The president would like to do the thing.
Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.
Dropping to 30 feet.
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president who was in favour of women having the vote?
He wrote a paper on suffrage while he was still in the Illinois legislature.
"Yes, I did know that because you tell me every time we do this."
"Castle, this is Hummingbird."
"We are short Foxtrot, one minute out."
- I need a go-no go.
"- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground all clear, three inbound."
"Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report."
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground."
You are clear.
Scanning sky south.
Clear.
"Hubby, what shall we do?"
Fashion design?
!
Court.
"Prosecutor, you can start your final address now."
Although sentiment counts beyond law.
One should be punished if he killed.
You'd better think.
"If your family was killed, what'll you do?"
"Now, all the evidences which the court admitted, prove Ho Foon is the murderer."
I request the jury would plead Ho Foon guilty.
Defence counsel.
My husband paid me to study law in UK.
"But I am so sorry to him, I didn't study law."
I studied fashion design.
"I am not well educated, but I don't understand one thing."
What's more important?
Legal procedure or life?
"Your Honour, if you don't mind me telling my point of view."
"I think that, you've studied so many years of law, you have got nothing at all."
"Like my husband, I haven't studied law."
But I dare to open my eyes to see what's right and wrong.
I am proud of my hubby.
I love him.
"Jury, I believe that you are not nuts."
You should know how to judge.
"If all of you are nuts, it'll be useless to say anything."
Thank you very much.
You've been released!
Yes.
You heard everything?
Yes.
Is there a listing for implosion grenades?
- Those were the days.
"- Artie, we've got WiFi."
"- No, no, no, I like paper."
"Actually, I hate paper."
"But, you know, it's a security issue."
"Okay, Artie, enough."
You have to fill us in.
"Okay, if the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword,"
Then what the hell does this sword do?
Yeah.
"I mean, it must be pretty major, right?"
You don't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife.
Exactly.
Okay.
You want to know about the sword?
I'll tell you about the sword.
"The Honjo Masamune is much, much more than a dull knife."
It kept the ruling Shogunate in power for hundreds of years
By making them invincible in battle.
And the beauty in the way these things were forged.
"I mean, ritually hammered and folded."
The blade millions of layers of steel
With a carbon content that's right off the charts.
And each layer only atoms--atoms--thick.
I mean this sword...
Is said to be perfectly aligned.
- So what does it do?
- Yeah.
"Um, ha, uh..."
"Okay, you know how geese fly in a ""v"" formation"
And the wind hits the first bird and then splits
England.
Not Birmingham.
The British bobby cannot be bought.
"- You, shut your face."
- Sorry.
- What are you offering?
- Nothing.
You must speak to my lawyer.
"What, old pervy Spurty?"
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
"Right now, everything seems to be in order here."
"I would stand by you, Richie, but lost causes depress me."
Toodly-woodly.
"Right, Spurty, do your stuff."
"Your Honour, I wandered into a garden, under the impression it was my garden."
"On seeing items of women's laundry hanged on the line,"
I naturally assumed that my wife had done some washing and I began to get it in for her.
"The fact that I live in a high-rise flat and am not married is circumstantial evidence and, hence, inadmissible."
Right.
"Well, we'd better escape."
Against Leon Brittan's law and order initiative?
Never!
No choice.
"The meat is in my trousers, Tarby is coming round to hear his golfing anecdote and you're banged up in the slammer."
Don't be disgusting.
I've never been banged up the slammer.
You're right.
We've gotta escape.
I have a plan.
What we have to do is set up a complicated system of stooges to find out exactly what the guards are up to.
"Then, we dig three tunnels and hide the dirt in our trousers."
Medication?
You want to put my daughter on medication because she interrupted your stupid story about a jungle gym on your head?
!
That's it!
I'm taking it off!
Aah!
Ladies!
"Please, stop!"
"Everyone else, there's spinach and artichoke dip in a bread bowl."
There's something about strong women that just gets me going.
"Again, that's my mother and my grandmother."
You're a lucky man.
"Oh, my God."
I cupped your boob.
- Attacked and fondled?
- Didn't fondle.
Aye!
The dip is delicious.
"Hey, Greg."
How are you?
How's your holiday going?
"Normally, I go upstairs and smooth things over, but this time, I can't."
Your mother would assume I was there to bed her.
"Well, I'm not going up there."
She was completely out of line with Anna-Kat.
"I agree the timing was way off, but it really wasn't that terrible."
It's not like Dr. Ellie hasn't suggested medication for Anna-Kat before.
I am not willing to go down that road until we've exhausted all the other roads.
"I totally agree with you, but it's there for us if we feel like she needs it."
"Because the singing in your head, from what we've seen today..."
not effective.
My mom just wants to drug Anna-Kat so she doesn't have to deal with her.

"- I told her, she wouldn't listen..."
"- You low, miserable, crazy slime."
- Don't you go shoving...
- That's your child she's carrying.
- It ain't.
"- I can prove it, Lucas."
I've got enough proof on you to put you in jail for the rest of your life.
- I never touched her.
"- Here, sign that."
It's a statement of the facts.
Are you out of your mind?
I never touched her!
Maybe you'd like the police to sweat it out of you.
"I never touched her, and I ain't gonna sign nothing that said I did."
"If you don't want to sign this paper, that's up to you."
"Hey, doc... ."
"You know I couldn't do nothing as awful as that, don't you?"
I'm going back to my office.
I'm gonna start telephoning every father in Peyton Place.
You wouldn't.
"I don't know what they'll do, but I do know this:"
"You're the janitor in a school full of young girls and an hour from now, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes."
Don't do it.
I wouldn't think of fooling around with any other girls.
"It was just Selena, doc."
"Well, there was something about her."
It was just Selena.
"Please, doc, don't."
There's only one thing that'll stop me.
You sign that.
"If I sign it, what are you gonna do with it?"
"The horses can be harnessed, we are on our way"
"There's still so much ahead, this is not goodbye"
"Allow me, my good friend, to thank you"
"Thank you, it's been a pleasure, dear Sherlock"
It's amazing what one coincidental encounter led to
From two perplexed strangers to a popular duo
"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"

What's wrong?
"Goni, how did I sing?"
Slow.
"For a general rehearsal, it wasn't too bad."
It was a great general rehearsal.
- It was a helluva general rehearsal.
Thank you for letting me be in the theater's biggest hit.
Amazing.

I have a problem in the entrance to scene 3.
It doesn't seem right.
I'll set it right for you later.
"Aside from that, I have a very good feeling."
Everyone does.
It's just the beginning.
I get to have no-strings-attached sex with someone who's not my husband.
That is the fantasy.
What's the ideal client for you?
Rich women.
They tip well.
Half the men I meet mistake me for a bank.
And the other half are either just plain boring or collecting social security.
"So, it's about companionship for you?"
"No, dear."
It's about the sex.
I take my job seriously.
"I brighten a lot of lives, and that takes care, focus."
I want every woman I'm with to feel... seen.
Feel special.
His name is Jeremy.
He was the only normal guy.
Marriage is a sacred union.
And your sex life is an expression of that bond.
"But when lovemaking gets routine, how can you spice things up?"
It's research.
"An open marriage can be a safe, fun way to bring excitement back into the bedroom."
And we can help.
I hired them for the party.
They work as a husband and wife team?
Yeah.
"That's crazy, right?"
I don't know.
"A lot of it does make sense, doesn't it?"
"I mean, when you meet them, they seem like a really happy couple."
Is this what we should be?
Polyamorous?
An open marriage?
"Now, you might be a couple of pounds overweight... but at least... we know where it is."
Are you..
Are you saying I'm fat?
Fat?
No.
Let's just say you're a little short for your weight.
"I mean, I think you're in pretty good shape for a 49-year-old man."
I'm 41.
"Bob, your chart says... 49."
"Well, I'm definitely 41, at least I will be this Thursday."
Then why does your chart say 49?
"Oh, That's a one."
My ones look like nines.
"Listen, Bob."
Now that I know you're eight years younger... you're also about eight pounds too heavy.
"Now I don't want to frighten you, but it's just possible... that every pound overweight could mean a year off your life."
"Well, it doesn't frighten me because..."
I hadn't made any special plans for those last eight years anyway.
"Oh, good."
"Miss Burke, get Dr. Hartley a copy of that-"
- High-protein diet?
- High-protein diet.
"Here you go, Dr. Hartley."
"Bob, you are gonna like this diet."
"It's sensible, easy to follow, and you don't have to turn anything purple."
Good.
As long as it's easy to follow.
Now look.
Get yourself a good medical scale.
Weigh yourself twice a day and keep a chart of it.
Carry this counter wherever you go.
Keep track of your daily intake of cholesterol and fats.
Did you get the make and the model?

"Sir, these are your presidential launch codes."
Keep them on your person at all times.
Vice President Alvin Hammond has just been sworn in..
as the 47th president of the United States..
"confirming, of course, the worst possible scenario.."
the death of President James Sawyer.
People all over the globe have been holding their breath.
They're wondering what is happening right here in America.
"After all, the United States has the biggest weapons arsenal in the world."
We need to start moving the money.
"-Denise, I owe you big."
There's government agents in your room right now.
Somehow they knew we were there.
Any idea how?
-Yes.
"- Alright, We're gonna have to ditch this car and hitch a ride into Albuquerque,"
- What's in Albuquerque?
- A friend.
"Whatever it is you're not telling me, Jaelen, I need to know."
We're running out of time.
-I was compelled by her.
I began experiencing feelings I never had before.
As if I were meant to find her.
I felt myself avoiding better judgment that this was wrong.
A forbidden code of conduct in my task here.
"I allowed it to happen, I wanted it to happen."
Andromedans enforce a very structured mating ritual.
A choice for companion is never our own and never random.
We're conditioned this way from birth.
Therefore there is never the opportunity for...
-Falling in love?
-Yes.
- But did she know the truth about you?
-I didn't have the time.
"But I couldn't stay in one place for to long, so the day approached when I had to tell her."
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
-What do you mean?
-There are people looking for me.
- Who's looking for you?
Do you need any help?
-I'm not from here.
"I'm not from Los Angeles, and I'm not from the United States."
Going back to that house is what Violet wanted.
You try telling her what to do.
"I'd like to, but I haven't had the chance."
You're handling it.
I need your help.
I'll stop by this afternoon.
Thank you.
I was eyeing that apple.
The pressure in his brain is still not coming down.
Continue the mannitol and hyperventilate him to a P.C.0.2 of 35.
Hey.
What happened?
Cerebral contusion.
He wouldn't stop seizing.
I had to induce a barbiturate coma.
"Neuro put a pressure monitor in, but I can't get the pressure to come down."
So he may die?
Yeah.
Little bit of justice.
I'm just saying.
"Sam, if he dies..."
Michelle could be charged with murder.
"And what, Tammy has a father who's dead and a mother in jail?"
"All right, well, now you're just making me feel bad, so stop it."
"Michelle, if you don't tell the truth now, you'll go to jail."
I am.
I just don't buy it.
You're still trying to protect some image that you have of your family or of Darren.
"It wasn't an accident, and if he dies, you will be charged with manslaughter or worse."
"You have to stop protecting him, if not for yourself, then for your daughter."
Think about Tammy.
I am.
I wanted to hurt him.
I have my own life now.
And I don't trust him.
This is really not about me.
I never was.
It's all about him!
What now?
Will you report me?
No.
Don't worry.
Gentlemen.
- Is the collector here?
Of course.
This way.
The deeply-felt beauty of an object and the sorrow of its transitoriness.
"Accepting the fleeting nature of existence, understanding that the transitoriness of Creation bestows it with value is the foundation of Japanese culture."
Many collectors hide their pieces behind glass.
I prefer to let them hang freely.
It makes them come to life.
Our society is in a transition.
Instead of advancing away from the primitive...
We are drawn back to our base natures.
Some more than others.

Can love have no obsession?
Can love have no desire to possess?
You didn't have such a thing.
Answer me.
"No, I don't."
What were you doing with me?
Were you playing with me?
Why are you doing this?
What do you want to know?
You're being way too cool.
You're ok.
She's miserable.
What happened to her?
She has an inoperable tumor at the base of her brain.
"It's probably been there, according to the doctor, since she was born."
"I guess as she got older, it grew."
We didn't even know it was there until three years ago.
"She's a tough cookie, you know."

Don't you have any other way of contacting him?

None.

So mine is the only unit still functioning.
And you can expect to come under heavy attack in the next few days.

Okay.
My leg just went numb.
"My legs went numb, but we're cool."
"That's okay, right?"
That's normal?
- You are so out of your element.
"- No, I'm not."
- What are you even doing here?
- I need tickets.
I'll do anything to get them.
"- What are you, like, a huge fan?"
"- Yeah, of a certain prickly brunette named after my least favorite season."
- You're doing this for a girl?
"- Well, to be clear, I'm actually getting the tickets for her and her boyfrien..."
Her boy... her friend that's a boy.
- I'm showing her that I'm capable of thinking of somebody other than myself.
Where's Bradley Walsh?
Is Bradley Walsh here?
APPLAUSE
"I think you'll find it's not daytime, it is access prime."
"That's what it is, very different."
"I'm sorry, access prime?"
Isn't that an account on Amazon?
"What time is that, Richard?"
"It's when non-middle-class people are home, but middle-class people haven't got home from work yet."
Ah!
"Middle-class people say, ""People who don't work watch your show."""
"You go, ""It's on at 5.15pm and most people finish work at 5pm"
"""and live quite near where they work."
"""Just cos you work in London"
"""and it takes you 4?"
"hours to get home to Northampton."""
"Someone's a bit touchy about their early start time, aren't they?"
"I can tell you, David Beckham is not one of our favourite Brits."
Aw.
"According to reports,"
"David Beckham's tax arrangements means he'll never get a knighthood, which is not even in the top five reasons I'm not getting one."
"OK, fingers on buzzers."
BUZZER
"OK, go on, what do you think?"
Is it the Queen?
"Fan of the Queen, Aisling?"
"Yeah, sure."
It's about time Britain gave her break.
"She's 91, she's been doing the same job for 65 years."
"I feel like she should do what all old women are allowed to do - grow out your chin hair, tour the Canaries on a boat, let a gas man in with an invalid ID."
Just...
I think that's what she deserves now.

"And then when he told me, I pretended I already knew, and I hate that even more."
I don't know what to say.
I don't even know what I'd want you to say.
What do you say Michelle Ross and Harriett Specter go out for a drink this week?
"Thanks, Rachel."
I'd like that.
"You told him, didn't you?"
What are you talking about?
Told who what?
Don't bullshit me.
You told Alex
- I was working the prison case.
- I didn't tell Alex shit.
What I did was I told you to drop it.
And I did.
"I didn't spend one more second working on it, just like you ordered me to."
Then what the hell is your problem?
My problem is he just showed up to the courtroom and blew up the case.
"He embarrassed us, he embarrassed me, and he did it in front of everyone."
The courtroom?
I thought you said you weren't involved.
I was sitting in the back watching.
"There's no law against that, and that is not the point."
"No, the point is you went from A to Z and assumed that I told him."
How the hell else would he know?
It's none of your damn business how I knew.
"No, no, this is between me and Harvey."
"Wrong, this is between me and you because you broke your agreement with my client."
I don't care what I did.
You didn't have to do that publicly.
I didn't make that decision.
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
"Well, fuck you."
"Next month I am going to buy another pair, but in red."
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
I have to be with my family.
"And besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
I am leaving.
See you next week.
Why so fast?
- Let's go please.
Damn it!
Tamales!
- What do you have?
Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
- Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you also want a sweet one?
- If you can give me credit until next time.
Thank you.
In Colombia a ten month old baby died... of an infection caused by rat bites.
The baby was malnourished and the mother informed... the authorities in her statement... that the baby's father committed suicide and left her alone with four kids.
The 10 year old was buried.
She was murdered by a neighbour who wanted to eat her
The victim 's family friends and classmates were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree.
The criminals have not been caught.
They decapitated two policemen in Mexico.
The heads were found at a site where police had killed drug dealers.
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
"""He tells me that he wishes to see you..."
"""his younger sister, before he dies."
"""Please come and see my father."
"""Sincerely yours, Clark. """
It's touching!
It sure is.
"Say, Grandma, let's go to Hawaii."
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.
"But still, this is all so strange."
It could be some kind of mistake.
Cut it out now!
"Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire... it's possible it could be a swindler claiming to be your brother."
But I bet there is no one fool enough... to bother lying about being a brother of poor Grandma.
"In the first place, these people are rich!"
Suzujiro Haruno.
"Surely, my maiden name is Haruno... but I can't remember the name Suzujiro."
"After all, I was born in a poor family that was blessed only with children."
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.
More than ten?
"Besides that, this man is an American, isn't he?"
- How could he be my big brother?
- It was written in the letter.
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant and became naturalized.
Although he has American citizenship...
Grandma's brother is still Grandma's brother.
This guy Suzujiro must be Grandma's elder brother.
Right.
"Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?"
You're the whole reason that I'm here.
You're the whole reason that I've done all of this.
You're the whole reason that I've made a complete ass out of myself.
I have failed here miserably.
And that does not bother me.
What bothers me is that I have failed you and I am not gonna do that ever again.
All right?
I love you a lot.
Let's go get a drink.
Oh.
"Honey, it has been forever since we did something like this."
Yeah.
"You know, baby, it's funny."
"Since we've been here, it's like the therapist and the place has made it like we got a problem."
But you know what?
I think we don't have a problem.
No.
We got a million problems.
Really?
Yeah.
"But, honey, I think everybody has a million problems."
"I don't know that, like, you,re supposed to solve them all, because the simple truth of it, sweetheart, is we're married."
We made a commitment to each other and to our families.
And to myself.
And I meant it.
"Shane, honey, wait."
"Jennifer, I don't need this."
I'm done with trying to make you like me.
I'm not gonna be the man you want me to be.
I'm not gonna do things the way you want me to do things.
I'm always gonna wear my heart on my sleeve because that's who I am.
And I got a lot of friends that like me just because I'm the way I am.
To the brick Kremlin.
She'll never forgive me.
"Come on, Animal."
What are you serving today?
Nitric acid?
I only work here.
Talk to the management.
All right.
Mr. Management what are you trying to do?
Embalm us while we're still alive?
"What did you expect, eight-year-old bottled-in-bond?"
All the house guarantees is you don't go blind.
Blind?
Harry!
Harry!
"Harry, I'm blind, Harry."
"Harry, where are you?"
I can't see you.
"I'm blind, Harry."
Harry.
"Harry, I'm blind."
Blind?
"How stupid can you get, Animal?"
"The killer-differ, of course, the real bonanza was when Sefton put up the observatory."
He scrounged himself some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barracks 2 to put the whole shebang together for a pound of coffee.
"On a clear day, you could have seen the Swiss Alps."
Only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps?
"It was about a mile away, that Russian delousing shack but we were right on top of it."
It cost you a cigarette or a half-a-bar of chocolate a peek.
"You couldn't catch much through that steam but believe you me, after two years in that camp just the idea of what was behind that window sure spruced up your voltage."
Let's go.
Twenty seconds to a customer.
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it. lt's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, M r."
Krakow?
I thought a lot about what you said.
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.
The school hasn't self destructed yet.
It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."
"- Hey, what's up?"
- Hey everybody.
"I hope you appreciate this moment, lieutenant."
"You see, I am a cavalry man."
All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men.
"Well, you know what happened to the cavalry."
"Just give me 5 minutes on that couch, will you?"
Five minutes.
The young ones they put into the panzer divisions.
"The older ones, they put in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers, or wardens, like me."
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.
"In Berlin, they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists."
But they will remember now.
Berlin?
General von Pfeffinger?
"Oberst von Scherbach, Stalag 17."
"Jawohl, Herr General."
Name:
"Dunbar, Leutenant Dunbar."
Sabotage.
"Jawohl, Herr General."
"Well, there will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin."
You will be interrogated by the general staff.
When it comes to the part about your arrest I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I just want to sleep.
I haven't slept in three days.
You will remember the name.
"Scherbach, von Scherbach."
"Well, Herr Inspektor, how did you find the camp'?"
"Crowded, but gemutlich, shall we say?"
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar.
- Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
-It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
"So, if I say to you:"
"- ""What are they doing here?"""
- Treasure hunting!
We might have problems.
"No, we won't."
The road and the film
One thing I often try to do in my films is to keep in mind my first impressions of a new region.
My first meetings with the people of the region.
I try to remember what happened on the day I arrived
in a new village.
How did people react?
How did I see them?
"Familiarity is not a good thing, when you get to know a region, you get used to it."
"I worked there for six months,"
"I knew it like my own back yard, but I had to recapture my first impressions."
The way I saw the people and the way they saw me.
I'll ask.
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Good morning, Madam."
"Good morning, I am honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"Turn left at the fork, it's 200 meters further on."
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The mourning rituals with the traditional self-mutilation of the face only exist in two regions of Iran.
In Lorestan and Kurdistan.
I went to Kurdistan first.
I found this remote village and I started to work.
"I would say, in a film, finding the location is one of the"
most important parts of the Director's job.
The location is as important as the characters in a film.
Got it?
Balloon jump?
"Look it up, Taffy."
What does it say?
"Oh, balloons."
The preliminary reports on the use of balloons for initial jumps are generally favourable.
"Due to the lack of the impact of the slipstream on the body, the tendency of the pupil to twist and somersault is almost eliminated."
That's nice.
The jumper has to fall a far longer distance before his parachute becomes fully opened.
This delayed opening produces an additional thrill.
You lucky people.
The phenomena known as a Roman Candle in which the parachute leaves the bag but fails to open in time...
"Lay off, will you?"
Canada?
Yeah?
"What's a ""Roman Candle""?"
A chute that doesn't open.
Did you ever see one?
"Yeah, I saw one."
What happened to the bloke?
"Got to sleep, will you?"
I'm bushed.
Miss?
"May I have another, please?"
What's wrong with this one?
"It's ex-tac, different from the others."
You're lucky.
It's what the pilots and instructors usually have.
"Change it, will you?"
"Hurry up, you."
"Well, the customer is always right."
"Though we do happen to pack about 50 parachutes a day, at least."
- Why?
"Oh, I don't know."
I-
I've had sort of a strange premonition.
"I don't know exactly how to explain it, but-"
"Explanations belong 5,000 miles away."
I only have one question... and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
I want to have the answer.
"It just struck me, Mr. Blake."
"Now my back please, Kali."
"I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far..."
I've taken this entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit.
"I still believe your story, but I think it's time... you gave me a little more positive proof."
"You should show us the map, Mr. Blake."
When I asked you in Dawson City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
"But the map, Mr. Blake-"
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map?
I see.
"Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you?"
The possibility that such a map may not exist- except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far... and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
"Now, now."
Who talked of killing?
"We're not pirates, my dear man."
I've been through all my clients and there's lots of prospects.
There's something about a group of tree hugging horsey people on a mission.
But have you even thought about what's gonna happen when all these people start showing up?
Matt's gonna know.
"I mean, they have to deal with him."
"Well, I've got time to talk Matt around."
"Actually, you don't have any time at all."
I just heard.
Meat truck's coming... tomorrow.
Hi there.
"Um, nice to see you again."
Will-will Clint be joining us today?
"Actually, my boss is on vacation, so all twelve of your emails were forwarded to me."
"Judging by the content of some of them, I'm sure you weren't aware."
So how would you like to go about these interviews?
"Well, protocol states that I should start with you and Peter."
Of course.
"Um, separately."
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, who would you like to..."
interrogate first?
You.
"And Mrs. Morris, this is not an interrogation."
This is for the good of your child.
It's okay.
There you go.
"That doesn't hurt, now, does it?"
You don't think I'd hear about what you're up to?
It's a small town!
You're just supposed to make sure these horses are healthy.
Not break them.
"Slade, you dragged me into this, yeah?"
And I want things done properly.
This girl has been attacked.
And that to me requires the police.
"Listen, if we call the police then we lose that trust."
And if we lose that trust then we have nothing.
"No police, no."
So what are you gonna about it ?
How did the meeting with Marosi go?
"Yeah, it was wonderful."
"Listen mate, can you get into work?"
I'm still here.
Why ?
OK good.
So I'm gonna send you a photo of a girl.
Have you had a girl reported missing recently looks who like this ?
She's got a really distinctive birth mark below her eye.
What's this about ?
"- I can't tell you that yet, mate."
- Let me just get this straight.
So I'm in the middle of a murder investigation and I'm dead on my feet.
"And you want me to talk to Missing Persons and God knows what, risking my career for God knows why."
And you expect me to do this just because we're friends?
"Yep, pretty much mate, yeah-"
I'll call you if I find anything.
"Hey, any luck tracing the dead woman through the phone networks?"
"Nada, zip, nichts."
"Yeah, a simple ""no"" is fine."
No.
"Is there any news, mate?"
"Yeah, her name is Gemma Morgan."
She's officially a missing person.
That is absurd.
All I could think was:
"""This isn't happening."
My sister loves me.
"And what the hell is Hello Kitty smiling at?"""
- Is that why you never came to see me?
- No.
- That place freaked me out.
- Of course it freaks you out.
- It freaks everybody out.
It's a loony bin.
"- Well, it scares me to see you like that."
"Allie, I need a sister that's gonna be there."
I need to know you're not just an illusion in my head.
I need to know your voice is really happening.
- I'm afraid.
- You need to stop being afraid of me.
"Lucy, I'm not afraid of you."
I'm afraid of becoming you.
"Bread pudding, everyone."
"There was that warm Columbus Day weekend when Dad was barbecuing his special wings, when that woman called."
She said there was something very wrong with you and that they'd taken you from your dorm in restraints.
I'd seen you the week before.
We'd taken you out in Westwood for your birthday.
"You were 19, the same age I am now."
You know how you told Luke that I was always the prettier one and the smarter one and the star of the family?
"Well, you forgot that I have better boobs too."
"Um, you do not have better boobs."
"Uh, mmm..."
"All right, fine, the boobs are a toss-up."
Um...
But you're right about the other stuff.
It's backfiring in the cockpit block!
Shut down bypass.
Removing cockpit block!
Hang on there!
This baby's never had a person on board.
It's just a little nervous.
Take your time and figure out why the pressure's rising.
"Yes, but..."
Take care of it.
Brother...
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
Something I value?
It's to save...
This world!
Result code is timed out!
It's overflowing!
Abort experiment!
Disconnect all circuits!
There's a crack in the chamber!
It's too late!
I didn't understand why he wanted to be on Dangaioh.
That's why I wanted to be on it.
So I could see for myself.
I can understand how your brother felt...
"He said, ""something more valuable than yourself,"" right?"
Uh-huh.
"That's why I'm here, too."
I'm glad you finally decided.
I'm very grateful.
"Because you agreed, our mighty States can now gain the power we need to exercise justice!"
The power to prepare us for the coming threat!
"The power you seek, namely, the power they are going to grant you, will not make you into a mighty soldier."
"A brilliant bloke like him, too."
"Cutter, we got to do something."
Come here.
- What now?
"- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something."
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
"Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off."
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
"Just a minute, Mac."
This one ain't buried.
"According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open."
"According to Gunga Din, eh?"
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
"MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say."
"You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?"
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right.
Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
"We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind."
"MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument."
"Cutter, I'm warning you."
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it!
"Yes, you heard me."
Of course you won't believe it as you're seeing me here talking nicely.
I can assure you at that time I'd see those news in which..
"A man kills his wife while she sleeps, you know..."
And I could understand them completely.
I surely would've killed her.
We got along pretty well...
Well I congratulate you because for me it was real hell.
Thank God!
Thank God I divorced on time.
"If not, I don't know how could have ended."
"I'm telling you, I had these terrible thoughts... tremendous!"
Did you manage everything patiently?
More or less.
Believe me I'm jealous.
She told me that if I was leaving she'd bring charges for abandonment of the home.
Do what you want!
That she'd get the children custody...
It's alright keep them all!
Look.
In my wrist.
Can you see a little sample of what happened the last day?
She almost break my arm!
She hit me with the iron machine and I thought she broke my arm.
"Actually, she tried to hit me in the head, so I took the iron machine from her and I hit her!"
I left her lying on the floor.
It was all messed up.
We fucked up everything.
I remember wondering if she was dead...
But not at all!
She just got some stitches.
Of course I didn't see her.
What?
!
Fleming:
Thank you for that.
I take it you didn't find anything.
"No sign of it, I'm afraid."
"But she might, of course, have panicked and got rid of it."
"Well, I doubt it."
"It's too valuable, and taking the letter in the first place was too much of a risk."
"I'm surprised Spencer hasn't, um-- let's go in here--hasn't mentioned it to you."
"He still trusts you, doesn't he?"
"Well, he's told me he's got it."
He's just not saying what he's done with it.
He likes to play these things close to his chest.
"Well, it's certainly not in the hotel."
We'll just have to keep looking.
"So, what about the shooting?"
You think Margaret Ellis was the target?
Do you?
"Well, there was nobody in the room who had any reason to kill her..."
"Except Arthur Ellis, perhaps."
He didn't have it in him.
The son?
Perhaps.
He could have opened the door.
But how would he have been able to see to take aim?
"I'll tell you one thing, though."
I happen to know for a fact that Mrs. Ellis changed her will hours before she died.
"She added a codicil leaving half her money, and that includes half the hotel, to the Friday club."
All for the cause.
"Spencer persuaded her, do you think?"
He's good at that sort of thing.
Why did Curtis McNeal believe that you know who killed his wife and who kidnapped yours?
I -- even met the man.
It was a dying utterance.
The courts give those weight for a reason.
The man killed himself.
"Obviously, he was unstable."
"All right, your son lied, your daughter ran, and now you're stonewalling me-- if I don't get complete cooperation from your family-- now--"
Sara's going to end up as dead as Amanda McNeil.
Or maybe that doesn't bother you.
"If I knew anything that would help find Sara,"
I'd tell you.
"Plausible deniability might work in Washington, but it's not going to help you in a criminal investigation."
Mom.
I told you not to come.
You want me to leave?
No.
Come here.
Why are you staying here under a different name?
You didn't tell anyone.
No.
I want to know what's going on.
Why is the FBI looking for you?
"Max, Max, sit down."
The FBI probably wants to talk to me because I said some nasty things about your father.
"Well, then just talk to them."
Get it over with.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Sara's missing and Dad's a wreck.
"If you know something, tell me."
"You know, the worst thing about the divorce wasn't losing your father."
It was losing Marcy and you.
Mom...
- What can you afford?
"100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once."
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.
"20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right."
I'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?
"No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company..."
How comfortable!
They will be much more able to give you something.
Marianne.
can you play something else?
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.
I meant something less mournful.
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne.
Elinor.
"- Mamma, we have nowhere to go."
- John and Fanny will be here soon.
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them?
Vultures!
I will start making inquiries for a new house at once.
"Until then, we must try to bear their coming."
"Margaret, are you there?"
"Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon."
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.
"Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter."
It is the law.
"- Come, we'll play with your atlas."
- It's not mine.
I feel a lot of pressure Right now.
"I mean, building a legacy For the pomrenkes."
Is what it's all about.
That's why I get out there And work as hard as I do.
That's all that's On my mind right now.
70 miles northwest...
I left my gun on my table.
I love that gun.
We got all the dredging.
That's the more important Than my gun.
"The fighting Kellys Are rolling the dice,"
Going where many believe They'd wind up anyway...
I've never River mined before.
I've wanted to do this For a long time.
Up a river.
I know we're going up against A lot of unknowns today.
And I know that It's gonna be a bitch.
So far this season...
I was wondering If it'd be a possibility.
If I could get My family on your claim.
I just don't think I want to Take a chance on you.
"Due to their Less than stellar reputation,"
The kellys have struggled To gain access to claims.
"Well, I haven't heard Any kind of good."
From anybody on you guys.
"Okay, well, thank you."
And even when they have...
Seriously?
It hasn't lasted long.
We don't have Anywhere else to work.
Could you imagine The old miners.
Having to walk out here Back in the day?
"I hope, Frankie was right."
You think anyone won't notice?
Wait.
I want to get a picture of my heroes.
All my heroes.
"Come on, Dad."
Just because Cody answered one rescue call doesn't mean he's part of the team.
"- Yes, it does."
- Or we're not.
Cody is our liasion on this mission.
He's the reason we're even giving this place a chance.
Are we clear?
"Dad, did that thing just talk back to me?"
Something's definitely wrong with the robots.
We can't use technology prone to malfunction.
They're not malfunctioning.
They're aliens.
- What?
- What?
Script by Arvegtor Timing by Deska
Galactic showdown!
"In a fierce battle for survival, the Republic and separatist armies have clashed in the distant Sullust system."
"Count Dooku's most cunning assassin, Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack."
"Trident group one, attack the starboard engines."
"Trident group two, knock out their port shield generators."
I'll go directly for their bridge.
The port side deflectors are gone.
Lord Tyranus.
My master.
There is a disturbance in the force.
"Your assassin, she has become very powerful."
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your God."
I understand.
Perhaps you could make your operative aware of our concerns.
Blackmire has a very sophisticated counter-surveillance program.
George Browne is an ex-CIA agent.
"If you have an operative in there, they will be exposed."
You don't have anything to be concerned about.
I don't have an operator in any kind of direct exposure.
Good to hear.
"If you could call me tomorrow, after you've spoken to your superiors,"
I'd appreciate it.
You can reach me any time.
Thank you.
I'll be giving you a call in the morning.
- Good night.
- A pleasure.
Likewise.
Call Julianna immediately and tell her she's not going on her trip with George Browne.
Anything I can do?
Call the FBI and start screaming.
They've been sharing our intel with the CIA.
It's Inspector Spalding.
I've had a visit from the CIA regarding our Blackmire operation requesting we drop it.
Please advise me what course to take.
She's not answering.
Is there wire on Julianna still up?
Is Julianna at her place?
She's just leaving with Browne.
- There they go.
- You got everything?
And that's it.
"All right, gentlemen."
Here's your financial statement.
"Up till last night, they only hit empty houses."
"But when they stumbled across Colin's girlfriend, they beat her unconscious."
Now you're just trying to scare me.
Can you help me out?
Take another look at this sketch for me.
"You should ask my friend, Vicki."
She had some stuff taken a few months ago.
"I never reported it, but they took a bracelet, three rings and my GFGD shirt."
Thank you.
Is that a band?
Fashion.
It's one of a kind.
A gift from a designer.
Vagabond chic.
"Retail, how much is that worth?"
"2000, maybe."
So when exactly were the items stolen?
March 9th.
It was Chelsea's birthday.
We got kicked out of Mondrian.
"Then she threw a drink at her ex at Avalon, the ridiculous one with the reality show, K.K."
"When I got home, I was packing for London to go visit my parents when I realized the shirt was gone."
Why didn't you report it then?
"Well, I was going to London."
Do you realize there's probably a dozen more Vickis out there who don't even know they've been ripped off?
Burglary's still burglary and Miranda's not Vicki.
"So how do you fence a $2000, one-of-a-kind T-shirt?"
First you got to find somebody willing to wear it.
"But if you do, they're gonna want to wear it where they can be noticed."
I'm thinking this T-shirt needs its own Facebook page.
Yes.
Have you seen me?
-I don't know.
Prayed.
They grew out of his mattress.
"Come on, Steve."
Hey.
- What do we do for decorations?
-For that you got to pray yourself.
"""And so, Joey we do hope that you will finish that last year of law school when you come back home."""
Law school?
"Hey, you don't want to be no stinking lawyer with a stinking briefcase in a stinking office, do you, Joey?"
No.
"""And do keep writing, son."
Your letters are very dear to us.
"With all our love, Dad."""
"Hey, it's from your dad, Joey."
"Here, take it."
"Next time we write to your folks, you know what you're gonna say?"
You're gonna say that you don't wanna be no lawyer.
"That you wanna be a musician, maybe, huh?"
And play the ﬂute.
"Yeah, Joey?"
"""I saw a wonderful article on German prison camps in one of the magazines."""
Mom reads a lot.
"""They showed pictures of the tennis courts and they also say that in the winter they freeze them over so you boys can ice skate."""
Anything about us grouse hunting in the Vienna woods?
"""In a way, I'm glad you're not in America right now with everything rationed here, like gas and meat."""
"Heart-rendering, ain't it?"
Why don't we send them some food parcels?
What do all those broads say?
What do they always say?
Let me read one.
"It's not good for you, Animal."
- Donnatella.
"- Good evening, Mr. President."
"Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish brigadier general who vanquished the Russian and Prussian military, came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the Revolution."
- I will.
"- It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s, when the Madison superintendent banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing understanding a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her home on Saturdays to read it."
"I didn't know that, sir."
Josh wrote you a memo on Molly Morello?
"Yeah, because all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho."
"It says,""She came in two hours early to teach an AP English class she developed, because the school didn't offer one."""
- I was in that class.
- She deserves a proclamation.
"- I wish I could give her one, but I can't."
- I understand.
"It's just too much inside baseball, you know?"
You're very nice to even talk to me about it.
"Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now."
- Sir?
"- The magic-man thing works better when you pick up on signals, Tonto."
What's that you say?
There's a phone call for Donna?
Good evening.
This is the White House.
For whom are you holding?
I'm holding for Donna Moss.
This is Mrs. Morello.
"- Oh, my God."
- Donna?
"- Mrs. Morello, it's me."
- Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.
"I hadn 't heard from you in a long time, so I..."
No.
I'm calling the police!
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
"Woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, leslie stoltz,"
"And we think the male voice belongs to coop daly,"
Enright's security.
"I'm still working a timbre comparison,"
But I'm fairly certain it's a lock.
"Well, it's compelling evidence."
Puts daly in the room.
"Unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law."
Can we float it to potential jurors?
"The takeaway will be, cardoza's still a dirty cop."
"Wait a minute, what?"
"Murder case in l.A. , evidence didn't fit his theory,"
He made it disappear.
"Rebecca, accusations"
Were made- nothing was ever proven.
"Okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to miami,"
And so here we are again with cardoza's dirty evidence.
"My advice, horatio:"
Fire him.
Out of the question.
Suit yourself.
"But not only will I reject this evidence,"
I will reject all evidence
That cardoza has anything to do with.
He is compromising your lab.
"Well, then I have no choice but to clear his name."
One should go to the nearest temple of any kind in a moment of weakness.
Maybe I shouldn't hurry about Moloch?
"Wise Solomon, people believe in your fairness."
Don't let doubts poison your grand design.
"The law will protect you from your enemies, because what you believe in will always become law."
"King, here are the petitioners from the city!"
Great King!
You're building a temple for pagan filth.
"New sacrifices will bring not glory, but fear."
The treasury has already paid for the building of the altar to Moloch.
Temples are expensive nowadays.
I'm decorating this city to glorify it.
Great King!
"There are madmen, who being blind, will worship the new idol."
Get him out of here!
Don't build the altar to Moloch!
The pagan filth will destroy you and all of us!
Glory to wise Solomon!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray!
What was there will go on.
What has been done will be done again.
There is nothing new under the sun.
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
"Have you come to your senses, you son of a bitch?"
Where am I?
What are you babbling?
Wait.
Let him drink a bit.
We won't tell anyone about it.
These are photographs of Patton's Allied invasion force in East Anglia.
The Germans think there are only two possible places for an Allied invasion of Europe.
And they're right.
"From East Anglia here to the Pas-de-Calais, or from the south coast of England to the beaches of Normandy."
Operation Overlord has decided on Normandy.
Then what is General Patton's army doing in East Anglia?
There is no army.
These planes are made out of plywood.
We did it to fool the Germans.
The man who took those photographs knows it.
"Consequently, he must also know that we intend to invade Normandy."
"Find him, Godliman."
It could cost us the bloody war.
"Well, sir, if you were at this station and wanted to get out of the country, you could go to Holyhead or Liverpool or Glasgow and then catch a ferry to Ireland."
He wouldn't risk Holyhead because of the passport control.
How about Liverpool to Belfast?
A car across Ireland and a U-boat on the coast.
You're talking about our 11.45 Marylebone to Inverness.
"stopping at Stafford, Crewe, Liverpool..."
Liverpool.
That's where he'll get off.
You're right.
- The 11.45 left on time.
- How do we get on it?
- You could stop the train...
- Yes.
Get us a plane.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Come on, Billy."
"- Fancy a game of poker, mate?"
- Why not?
We're stopping again.
- What was your last assignment?
The assignment was to rate Officer Hardy's competence   and to monitor his interest in the Three Rivers murder case.
You state that Officer Hardy neglected his duties   to pursue an illegal investigation into the Three Rivers murder case.
To what do you attribute his unusal interest in the case?
He feels the murders were committed by the Polish Hill murderer.
A case he worked on.
A prosecution witness in the case   said that Officer Hardy threatened him.
And that you were forced to protect him with your own weapon.
"No, that's incorrect."
- I drew my weapon as backup.
- Backup?
Officer Hardy was not...
out of control and dangerous?
At no time whatsoever.
Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
I wish we had more officers...
- Excuse me...
- Don't you want my evaluation?
"Thank you, Detective, you may step down."
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
- Why'd you change your testimony?
- Why do you think?
- You cheat good.
- Hardy.
"Hi, Emily, it's your father."
Sarah just wanted to say hello.
She's enjoying her visit.
We'll see you Sunday.
Bye.
"Hi, Jo..."
I mean Emily.
"Come on, dude."
The line is moving.
It's been half an hour.
There are extra classes at school on Saturday and Sunday.
We have to come to school 5 days a week and stay behind for extra lessons 3 times.
"Besides this, you still have a lot to catch up with from past years."
I've made a list of books that you should buy.
Be sure to get them as soon as possible.
"Preparation for Student Selection Exam, The Exam Questions of the last... 10 years, Writing Guide, Turkish Texts 1, Applied Math 2..."
Dictionary of Idioms.
What's all this?
Perfect for a start.
We should get started in an easy mode.
Easy?
Yes.
I got the Lotto Papers.
What do we do now?
Fill it out right away.
We don't have much time left.
Hold on a second.
Let's catch our breath.
You have a maximum of one minute for each question.
Pay attention to the questions.
The choices are full of tricks.
Which of the options below is not meant in this paragraph?
Which of the following is not even there at all?
Be careful with negative and reverse questions.
They will do their best to make us fail.
Bastards!
I never knew there were so many tricks involved.
I'm exhausted.
Let's sit down somewhere for a few minutes.
He tried to grab her in front of my old mother.
He was smelling of cheap liquor.
"So, Sarika pushed him away."
After that he just went mad.
Tried to kiss her..
Caught her arm so hard that he has left marks!
"Sir, let him return home my husband will take him to a task."
Do not let him return is what I came to say.
Your husband is due for a promotion it will be very unfortunate..
..if instead of a promotion he has to sit in front of some anti-corruption inquiry committee.
Mukesh... pack your things right away and leave the house!
"Where will I go, Buaji?"
I don't care.
Go to a friend!
Or rent a room!
Very independent you have become.
You make enough money giving tuitions to get drunk on.
Mr. Khanna is lying!
I had just gone over to meet Sarika.
Everybody is aware of Sarika's reputation.
"Why her husband is targeting you, I don't know."
"But if you stay here, you will land all of us in trouble..."
So for God's sake please spare us.
Oye!
Tuition master!
What happened?
And what's with all this luggage?
Come with me...
Come in.
Settle down.
Mauritius.
My aunt's son lives there...
"If you don't run, you spoil our fun!"
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Is he using that magic to accelerate?
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Are you okay?
"Yes, but you... that magic..."
You should know it.
"I didn't want to use it, though."
Damn it.
So that was...
You!
Why do you use our magic?
He couldn't be!
An Alpha Stigma bearer?
The eyes said to bring forth disaster!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash..."
Stop!
Don't use magic!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash the magic beast which dances through the skies!"
"If you'd used that power sooner, everyone might not be dead right now!"
"We only faced three of them, so we made it out alive."
"Besides, it's been seven years since I've used this power..."
You gave us an interesting spectacle there.
"How rare to see an Alpha Stigma, monster."
Cower more!
"Amuse me, monster."
"You have an Alpha Stigma, right?"
Show me something nice.
"Do you get it yet, monster?"
Those two are the only ones left.
We killed the rest.
All of them.
"""No, no, no, no."""
"""No, no, no, no."""

"When you work here, you don't think about home"
- and families and babies.
- That's not fair.
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year...
"Let me tell you something, Stephanie."
"Maybe you don't know how babies are made, because when people are trying, they know they're trying!"
I was wrong to say we didn't know about the case.
It's regrettable.
"What exactly does it mean, that Ussing is listed in that book?"
"In light of the prosecutor's negligence and the testimony you pointed out, it is something that we're keeping a keen eye on."
- As a suspect?
- it's a possibility.
Right now we're focusing on finding the perpetrator.
The book won't be of much use to him.
It only contains car registrations.
He's wounded.
We'll catch him soon.
Then we'll hopefully also know what's happened to Emilie Zeuthen.
Will Ussing be investigated?
We'll leave it to Special Branch and the police.
Focus on our duel with Ussing tomorrow.
I'm not slinging mud without more intel.
"You must admit, things aren't too bad."
- Lebech would like to meet again.
"- Bloody hell, is she serious?"
The Centre Party have made their choice.
Will you check on the event tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll go in five minutes.
See you.
"Thank you for all your efforts, Karen."
I want you to know they mean a lot.
- It's my job.
"- Yes, but anyway..."
Do you have a minute?
"No, not really."
I'm off to the Ministry of Justice to check up on Mogens.
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
How would the kts like to party with the ZBZs?
- What kind?
"- The biggest, baddest most rule-breaking party CRU will never see."
When you put it like that.
We're in.
Good!
Is you shirt on inside out and backwards?
It's just... joggging.
This is the common room.
"It looks like TV football, viewing party last night."
You guys surely know how to have a good time.
Welcome to our temple of good times and life-long brotherhood.
Our casa es su casa.
We're walkin'.
You got any question so far?
- What are your academic requirements?
- Every active member must take one course per semester or you get us skip talking to.
"But I mean, you have to take four course just to be in the Greek system?"
I'll look into that.
We're still walking.
Here are our lovely gardens.
Do you have any kind of mentorship program?
"The OC, they had a lot of connections."
"You know, CEO and like so."
"Last summer, bunch of the active did some paid internships."
That's a good point.
Jack Rabbit gives all the active and pledges 20% discount at his hut.
- Is that what you meant?
- Kind of.
It's good.
And here is the lovely recreation and relaxation room.
Excuse me.
"So, since god planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now,"
why are so many of us hurting and angry inside?
It's because we refuse to believe in god's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only -- so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
"The lord sacrificed his only son for us, paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment."
"Sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
"She's a blessing to us, too."
Paige says you work in travel.
Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
"Yeah, we -- yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips -- see all the good her generous donations are doing.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
There was a meeting between the D.O.D.
Like what?
I don't know.
One of my favorite ones is the one about you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.
"Well, they have the decency to bury me, at least?"
Can't say.
Don't really keep track of the rumors I didn't start.
Got any rumors about me being made sheriff?
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna like you coming back.
"Well, he's gonna find he ain't got much room to argue."
Maybe I don't like you coming back.
"You know I always told you, you deserve better than this."
Marla.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
"Hey, how come that thing always stayed broken?"
Don't got a phone connection at my ma's old house anymore.
"Marla was good about looking after it, but..."
Use that one.
You ever hear anything about me getting murdered?
"Yes, sir, I believe I have."
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?
- Yeah.
- No kidding?
"Heard you was mouthing off like you used to, and... somebody just shot you right there how you stood."
"Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna welcome me back from the dead?"
Asshole.
Armor-piercing.
"- They call them ""cop killers."""
- Why is that?
On account of them killing cops.
"Do you need it for, like, DNA?"
Forensics lab is two weeks and 150 miles away from giving half a shit about this town.
This is not how the Nazis started!
Exactly like this.
Honkytonk Man!
It's...
Don't keep saying it - we heard you the first time.
It's a genuine film.
"I expect a text from you tomorrow, from all of you, in fact, just going,"
"""I'm sorry."
"I got home, I looked it up."
It's a really good film
"""and it was very sad at the end."
"He coughs up blood."""
I don't think it was probably released here.
It was!
"I don't want to start a beef with Brian May, and that's a sentence I've never said before, but the badger is Ireland's most dangerous wild animal in terms of attacks."
I am listening.
I'm just looking up Honkytonk Man.
"Oh, come off it!"
You'd have to go out of your way to find the badger and then poke it with something.
"OK, this is what I've heard."
"There's a time of year when the badger mates and during that time, if you walk onto their turf, then they will come..."
Turf?
"Yeah, they will..."
Literally.
Badgers in Harlem.
That was a good film.
"Now, that one I saw."
Clint was brilliant in that.
So the badger has a locked jaw.
"If you're walking through the woods and...so the badger, ""Oi oi!"
"This could be a mate rival!"""
So the badger comes and attacks you because it thinks you're going to shag the other badger?
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.
"So, Hadji's girlfriend finally came to her senses."
What happened?
She didn't wanna be a fifth wife?
[Laughing]
- Hadji.
- All right.
"Well, it's her loss."
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game... will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life.
Look at us.
We're hanging out with my parents.
"Yeah, about that."
Feel free to get the hell out.
"Well, we can do better than this."
"You guys, we're gonna graduate in two months... and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us."
"We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns."
"Okay, but I tell you this from experience."
"If we're gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan."
"Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight?"
"Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around with their parents... giving them snarky looks."
I remember when the Brady kids got bored... and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
[Chuckles]
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.
Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!
- Water.
Firewater.
- Very funny.
Don't worry.
The man is trustworthy.
There won't be any problems.
"After his escape, we'll hide him here."
"As soon as things have calmed down, we'll take him to the cloister."
I'll be there.
"Hey, guys, we have a new guest."
"Well, I'll be damned!"
"If this isn't Smithy, Jaguar Carrasco's right-hand man."
How does it feel to be here as a European who is paid for playing a revolutionary?
"Amigo, we're your friends."
You look as if they've tortured you quite badly.
Why don't you lie down?
You can even have my bed.
This is John.
"They haven't treated him well, either."
They've pumped him with drugs.
"That's Alfonso, a journalist whose sole intention was to write about the truth."
"Joaquín, a poor fool who put up a banner in front of the palace."
"Come on, sit down."
- How long have you been here?
- A few years.
You can get used to anything.
"There's light and air, and sometimes you even get food."
"Some go mad, others cope."
You'll have to see which group you belong to.
Just don't think too much.
It's a great honour to shake hands with a friend of Carrasco's.
We've heard about the dam.
Jesus... can I just have a few minutes?
We wanna know who you are.
"We'll find out, you know."
Sooner or later.
You could save us some legwork by communicating with us now.
Are you a Satanist?
You in some kind of cult?
"Coz if there are others involved, we'll find them too, believe me."
What's the matter?
Is that it?
Is there someone you wanna tell me about?
I'm sorry.
The Nurse at reception downstairs is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.
Says it's urgent.
I'm coming
I'll be right back.
yeah
His daughter?
When was this -- is she still here...?
"did she leave any information, a phone number...?"
What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph..."
"There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might."
"Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal."
The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past...
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
Now and Later... the really tasty treat...
Now and Later... the flavor can't be beat..
Look at all those pieces
"You mean, tricycles don't really fall out of her arms?"
"Uh, no."
Oh my god!
Of course they don't!
"I mean, just think how flabby her arms would have to be for a tricycle to be up in there, and for so many years."
"And she didn't even notice it, not even when she took a shower."
That's hysterical.
I get it.
I get the joke!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
This should be fun.
"Um, I'd like to welcome you all here tonight."
"Before we go any further,"
"I think that we should all acknowledge the sensational job, that my esteemed colleague, Dr. Mary Albright has done in organizing this truly worthwhile event."
Dr. Albright.
Don't you love Dr. Albright?
I know I do.
"Now, I know many of you are wondering, what's with her long sleeves?"
"Well, I'll tell you."
It's to cover up her flabby arms.
"She shook them the other day, and the dead sea scrolls fell out."
"She's, uh.. she's quite old also, you see."
"But you know, as sweet and wonderful, as Dr. Albright is, she can also be somewhat domineering, power-hungry and hostile, and I think I finally figured out why."
"Dr. Albright, while you may not have a man's genitalia, at least you have his razor stubble."
"Oh, oh, oh!"
Oh!
And there's Nina.
Nina is Dr. Albright's assistant.
"Nina, stand up, stand up."
"Come on, stand up."
"Show everybody how you put the ""Ass"""
Relax.
I'm finally having fun.
Let me.
"Jesus, you know, I always thought the old Amy was kind of an uptight bitch, but now I sort of miss her."
"You know, if I was uptight, I'd be offended by that."
"In fact, I am offended."
You shouldn't call people bitches.
You shouldn't do that anymore.
"Unless it's like ""bitch"" or something like that."
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
Thank you for your service.
"How was the meeting, sir?"
Very productive.
It's like something out of a political cartoon.
"What, you mean not funny?"
"Oh, my God."
How the hell did Moyes end up on two lists?
I made it clear Ben should run all his list alterations past me.
"No, mine was the master list."
Your list was a sub-list.
"It was a sur-list, which means over-list."
"- Oh, fuck you."
- Your earwax could bring down a president.
And I didn't even want to see Dan and Amy.
And now they're expecting money.
- I didn't know that.
- Money?
Money?
"Gary, I said access only."
"Yeah, now we're gonna have to divert funds from the campaign and that's fraud."
And then we're gonna have to destroy the evidence and that's conspiracy to commit fraud.
I heard that.
Hey you're not supposed to be talking while you're driving!
Well I already lost Jesse to Hannah.
And now I can't go to college.
Because I was busy selling out stadiums.
And meeting the Queen of England.
Instead of holding a spit bucket for the girls wrestling team!
Ow!
Look I know.
I was really thinking about this.
You know what if you said you were Hannah Montana's assistant?
I mean that way you still did all the stuff but as her assistant.
You couldn't have thought of that 200 miles ago?
"[Singing to the tune of ""On the Road Again""]"
In the car again.
Miley Stewart's back in the car again.
Driving places she has already been.
Miley's arriving back to school again.
Yee-haw!
Today our topic is heartbreak and disappointment.
Who out there has lost a boyfriend recently or a good friend.
Or maybe didn't get into the college they wanted to get into?
I.
Nice try honey.
I'm a visual manifestation of your over-stressed subconscious.
And I'm with you for the next 200 miles.
So you're a mess.
Let's start from there.
Hannah Montana's assistant?
That sounds fascinating.
Why didn't you include that in your application?
Miss Montana likes me to keep it very low profile.
No.
I'm staying here.
"Good night, Franz."
Why don't we all just go to bed?
"You don't know me, otherwise you wouldn't suggest that we all just go to bed."
"Have yourself a nice evening, and drink some cognac down at Tonis."
We'll see you tomorrow.
"My mother used to always say, the best guests are the ones who complain."
That way you can always improve yourself.
My mother worked in this restaurant for fifty years.
And I think...
There's far too little complaining here.
Can I finally get back to work boss?
I'm not done yet.
"Angie, there are problems."
What kind of problems?
We'll do a little demonstration for you.
Are you ready?
What kind of demonstration then?
Just say that your ready!
In that case I'm ready.
"What can I do for you, boss?"
A beer for me.
You want something too?
I'd like a soda please.
A beer and a soda.
Right away boss.
"What sort of demonstration is this supposed to be, boss?"
"We're not done yet, Angie."
"Angela, my name is Angela, and not Angie, boss."
"Angie, you are, generally speaking, if I may say  the problem that some people have with service industry."
But actually the problem isn't you.
"Like, for being too silly."
No!
Wayne.
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.
"Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up?"
It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly.
Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you.
They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly.
"And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like..."
"Like, wish you could still do that."
"That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon."
We sit the child down...
- That's another problem.
- What is?
- In my opinion.
- Sitting?
"Well, no wonder kids are failing' school, just sittin' around all day."
"Stand up, you're not doing nothin'."
You think sitting is a problem?
- Yeah.
- Why?
'Cause it makes you soft.
- Literally or figuratively?
"- Well, both, I suppose."
- Both?
- Yeah.
In my opinion.
My phone's buzzing.
"Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey?"
"Well, I think it's pretty good, too."
"Hi, Michelle."
"- But that's what you mean, isn't it?"
I think you should leave.
I don't think you should come here again.
Very well.
"For most of Tutankhamun's reign, the real power was wielded from behind the throne by a military council run by the young king's advisor, Ay."
"But when Tutankhamun reached the age of 18, he would have claimed his inheritance to rule Egypt as a divine pharaoh."
The king's newfound power would not last long.
"In his tenth year on the throne, Tutankhamun died."
Exactly why remains a mystery.
"Some believe he was murdered by his own advisors, or perhaps he just had an accident."
Examination of his body using modern scientific techniques showed a leg injury which could have been fatally infected.
Tutankhamun was still a teenager.
And lift!
"Lift slowly, very slowly."
(Workers speaking Arabic)
"Down, Pecky."
"Pecky, down."
And tilt.
Tilt it.
Lift!
"All right, lower, lower, lower."
Slowly.
Go slowly.
"- Afternoon, Carter."
Where have you been?
- Packing.
I have to go to Cairo.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- I've had a telegram.
Carnarvon is ill.
- Nothing serious I hope.
- I rather think it is.
/ Sure.
Bet he's got plenty of hands and other pieces stashed somewhere.
"Maybe he's dipping them in wax,"
- passing them off as sculpture.
- What?
A classic Vincent Price movie.
You gotta see it.
"""House of Wax"" (1958)"
I'd rather see here Bianco's hauling Mr. Dead body.
Hudson medical school?
I can't believe they'd hire a sleazoid like Bianco.
Looks like he's an outside contractor.
Does that jacket say UPS?
It says APS.
Anatomical procurement services.
Cooler's too small for our body.
He didn't have time to cut it up.
This is unacceptable.
The order was for 20 knees.
"Well, the students will just have to share."
My students are surgeons getting CME credit in advanced arthroscopic techniques.
These people are not accustomed to sharing.
"Actually, they won't be a problem."
"I'm sorry, there is no auditing of this course."
We're not here to audit the course.
We're here to audit the school supplies.
This medical school buys thousands of body parts.
"But I assure you, all the paperwork is in order."
"Where do you think you're going, Frankenstein?"
"Well, I just make deliveries."
I don't know where they come from.
"- Russ Bianco, you're under arrest."
I can see why you don't do this face to face.
It can be very awkward.
Hi.
And then you'd say...
"""Hi."
"How was your day?"""
"Oh, me?"
"I had a really weird day, actually."
And now I'm here... alone in my apartment.
You're probably in your big house... with your family...
and your dog.
And probably your dog has a family too.
You're probably all gathered around the fire singing carols... even though it isn't Christmas.
Just for fun.
"You will never, ever see this... because you'll never watch this far on the tape."
"You'll probably never even watch the tape, will you?"
I could do anything right now.
"If you are watching this... then just call this number, okay?"
"Just call this number, the number you see on your screen... and say ""macaroni. """
Okay?
That's all you have to do.
"Just ""macaroni""and hang up."
No questions asked.
I thought we'd have breakfast for dinner.
And then maybe sometime we'll have dinner for breakfast.
Just to mix things up a little.
But there's still ice cream for dessert.
It's fine with me if you guys want to continue this silent treatment.
It's like a Zen retreat for me.
- Can I see it?
- I didn't use the book.
I made it up.
"I would havejoined the Party gladly, but I've been baptised. I'm a believer."
-lt seems to be quiet.
- Let's wait.
-Will this show start soon?
"-Yes, pretty soon."
I used to feel the sniper's look on my spine during the Finnish campaign.
The feeling made us freeze.
Although they paid more attention to officers.
We soldiers were less alluring forthem.
"Listen, it seems to me that my dad was buried in the vicinity ofthis hill."
-What made you make such a guess?
"- The place is called Zabolotye, isn't it?"
-Yes.
- This is where he was killed during World War I.
"Afellow villager came back from that war and told us that it happened near a city of Kaza, a marsh, a small river."
Everything seems to fit the description.
I neverthought I'd find his grave.
"And if it is true, eh?"
The family's fate has brought me to this hill...
There are a few mortar squads to the south ofthese pines.
The distance is about 400 meters.
"No, it looks more like 500."
5 machine gun slots 30 meters awayfrom the hillock
-Are theyto the right to to the left of it?
- To the right.
"OK, Germans, show more to us!"
-Two more slots to the left ofthe hillock.
- l got it.
"-Well, writers, are you working?"
"-Yes, we do, but there is not much to write about."
There is some dug-out there.
"This is not some dug-out, but a full-scale communication point."
From this moment on you're a lieutenant in the 95th
Major Hogan
- meet Mr Sharpe.
- Congratulations.
"Capital choice, sir."
The minute I saw him I looked.
"Hogan says ""Aye that fellow don't seem much but he's a natural-born officer """
"Of course, you know, Sir Arthur, he'll need a mentor."
"Hogan, you keep your hands off him."
Hogan is an officer on...
- Ahem!
- On my staff.
Your colonel will be informed.
I'll request light duties till his wound be healed
Good day to you both.
"Light duties, sir."
Light duties it is.
Absolutely.
"See here, Sharpe."
Light duties means staying at headquarters and being snubbed by snobs.
How would you like me to find you something else?
"As long as it's safe, sir."
That's my boy.
So the bankers won't budge?
"Afraid not, Sir Arthur."
We need to find Rothschild.
I'd like to suggest we add that fellow Sharpe to Dunnett's search party.
I make a man an officer today and you want me to send him into the mountains tomorrow.
"- Have you no heart, Hogan?"
"- No, sir."
"We need somebody to command Dunnett's sharpshooters, and Sharpe will be much happier up in the mountains than up in the mess."
"You know the problem, Sir Arthur."
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"- There has to be a safety measure, right?"
- No.
- Something or someone?
- There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
"If we do our job, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
Should I go on?
No!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Please!
"Take us to Schmidt, I won't say another word."
"Come on, Dixon."
I'm in a hurry.
Don't forget your Oreos.
"Counterintelligence, broadly speaking, is the practice of spying on someone who's spying on you."
"With a little patience, you can learn a surprising amount about your enemies just by watching their own surveillance teams."
"It starts with carefully observing who's at what location, when they're there, and how often."
"Once you have a list of possible candidates, you cross-reference with people from other surveillance sites."
"If anybody shows up more than once, it's a safe bet it's not just a coincidence."
It's a lot easier to keep your secrets if you know who's after them.
Gotcha.
Why can't we just knock on the door?
You don't know Calvin Schmidt.
He's not gonna open the door for five people with guns.
It's okay.
So I-I have to be your pretend girlfriend?
Come on.
Here we go.
Kiss for luck?
Never mind.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Hi, Calvin."
It's really --
Was I -- was I unclear the last time we spoke?
"I gave you a fat stack of cash, and I told you to forget my address."
"Yes, I know."
"But look, look -"
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the chapter that you have on the entities you call..."
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
What say you to Thursday?
"My Lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow."
"Thursday it is, then."
"Come, gentle night."
"Come loving, black-brewed night."
"Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars."
He will make the face of Heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.
My husband.
My wife.
Must you be gone?
It's nowhere near the dawn.
"You heard the nightingale and not a lark, I promise."
She sings each night sitting in yonder tree.
"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn."
No nightingale.
"Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east."
"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
I do not think the light is daylight yet.
I am content if you would have it so.
I have more heart to stay than will to go.
"Come, death, and welcome."
Juliet wills it so.
I will lie with you and say it is not day.
It is.
It is.
Go now.
Begone.
Away!
"Oh, it is the lark that sings so out of tune with horrid discords and unpleasant sharps."
"Oh, hurry now."
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
"Let the record show that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr. Hill identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document....
The hardest thing was leaving the life.
I still loved the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all just for the asking.
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because they will do anything to survive.
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.
-l know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay back the bookies.
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
When I was broke I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
"With a bite mark from the victim, I'd fold too."
Here we go.
We don't concede anything at this point.
"My client needs to sleep, gather his thoughts."
We'll talk after the arraignment.
Defendant's ordered to surrender his passport.
Bail is set at $1 million.
Next case.
I hope your client's rested and ready to talk.
Nothing to talk about.
It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do.
I guess the jail house grub made him think twice about getting a plea.
Gloves and a pillbox hat?
Looks like she's going to an afternoon tea.
I'm looking for the elevators.
"Yeah, they're back there."
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?
I don't think Philip's lawyers would want me talking to you.
"Well, did he tell you about the evidence that we have against Mr. Reinhardt?"
The bite on his neck from Laura.
I know about it.
She bit him when he flirted with her in the wardrobe racks.
- He told you this?
- Laura did.
The last time she came to my dressing room.
And why didn't you tell us that?
"At the time, it wasn't important."
Your part-time boyfriend hits on your daughter.
You don't think that's important?
Philip is harmless.
I told Laura she should be flattered.
"And now, if you would excuse me,"
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"- Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
- Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
- That's right.
"- It'll be very dirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
- Shall I give you the key?
- Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""masses-media"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
- The keys...
"Beseech you, tenderly apply to her some remedies for life."
"The queen, the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead."
- Oh!
- O thou tyrant
Belake thee to nothing but despair.
"Go on, go on, I have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest."
Prithee bring me to the bodies of my queen and son - one grave shall be for both.
Upon them shall the uses of their deaths appear unto our shame perpetual.
Good Antigonus
Sin fate hath made thy person for the thrower-out of my poor babe
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weep and leave it crying
"And, for the babe is counted lost forever"
"Perdita, I prithee call it."
"Blossom, speed ye well"
"There lie, and there thy character."
"Farewell, for the day frowns more and more"
Thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough.
Oh!
Oh!
- Why...?
- I am gone for ever!
What have we here?
"Mercy on's, a barne"
I'll talus it up for pity
Yet I'll tarry till my son me.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I have seen two such sights by sea and land!
"Why, boy, how is it?"
Now bless thyself thou mettest with things dying
I with things newborn.
then how about you stay for the night?
"there's a good hot spring near by no, we'll be leaving"
I'll go let's go to hot spring
[Men] don't say you want to go
I said it so what can I do?

"if, there's nothing now"

I think he's gonna be lonely lately

well he is my dad blood is stronger than water
I'm more worried about your future your vast vocabulary?
you don't sound like a kid so I think that there's a plan we can work out plan?
what?
new slogan?
I talked with hirano-san again and
What do you got?
Three people came in and went directly to a cage or table and cashed in $100 chips.
"One of those people, I would definitely call him a person of interest."
You know what I mean?
No.
His name's Ben Hollis.
No record.
But you remember Sean... who got her counterfeit chip from the guy she hooked up with-Alex.
"If you keep tracking Ben, like I did, you get to this."
Ben giving Alex a stack of phony chips.
Interesting coincidence.
Okay.
Find him.
Gift shop.
What about those chip-making machines?
All five machines outside Vegas are accounted for.
"One was recently sold and is in transit from New Jersey to California, but the buyer says he's been checking with the driver every day."
- The truck's currently in Colorado.
- How can you be sure of that?
"I got the driver's number, called him and verified the location of the cell- westbound I-70, just this side of the Eisenhower Tunnel."
"Yes, but cellphone calls can be rerouted."
You get any specs on the rig?
"Yes, upstairs."
All right.
"""Swami, punish Jalandhar before reaching Kailash."""
Let him come here.
He will get the punishment for his sins.
"""Shiv, if you want to escape from war, handover Parvati to me"""
"""Why are you quiet, swami?"
"-Shukracharya, you prayed me..."""
...and got Mritunanjay Mantra.
Is this is your gratefulness?
I believe you meant that.
"Oh, I did, sir."
"I'd say we make rather a good team, don't you?"
Yeah.
"Sort of like Sherlock Holmes and Watson, sir."
"No, no, no, no, no."
More like Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes.
"Well, what I mean, sir, is the way I see it,"
I'm working with the highest paid detective in the world.
It's not as high as it sounds.
Not when you have to pay out as much as I do.
"Well, I gotta get to work on Sid Daley."
"Boy, it's hard to find someone in Rome, sir."
"Yes, I imagine."
But his story has to be checked out just like anybody else's.
"Oh, by the way, sir, did I mention that we found the gun in the prop department?"
No.
What you said was that was where you were gonna look for one.
"Oh, that's right, sir."
Right.
And you didn't wanna jump to conclusions.
No good detective should.
Was there anything on the gun?
"Anything like what, sir?"
"Fingerprints, what else?"
"Oh, right."
"No, I don't think so, sir."
The lab is still running tests.
"By the way, sir, why do you think he put the gun back and threw away everything else?"
Perhaps because he didn't have time to get rid of the gun safely.
Guns are very easy to trace.
And the prop room may have seemed the safest place to him.
He lives above his head a little.
I am reminded of Louis the Whatever's finance minister:
De-something.
He built this chateau.
Nicole and I saw it when we went to Paris.
"It even outshone Versailles, where the king lived."
"In the end, Louis clapped him in irons."
"Look, Tony."
"All I can promise you is, I will look into it."
"I understand you got to try to feel out your old man so he don't give you 'a mazz'.... you know, for sticking your nose in."
I haven't been afraid of my father for quite some time.
Fair enough.
"But, Carmine, bear in mind, he came onto my turf."
He tried to recruit my mulignon.
"And worse, he roughed up my appraiser."
If the proper response is not forthcoming in a business-like time frame... my next move will not be further conversation.
I get it.
You should know that my next call will be to Johnny Sack... to let him know that we talked.
He shouldn't feel blind-sided.
Hello?
I'm here for the masoner job.
Me no speak the English.
Mi dispiace.
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
"Meaning, even if the odds are only 1 in 1,000 that I can get the job done, there's still a chance"
"so yeah, I had defective semen."
"But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."
"Well friends, I believe Chips has just settle the old question:"
Is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?
And the answer is?
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day
six girls?
That's nicely done.
Just putting to good use my large sex organ my brain.
"Thanks for that, Chips."
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.
"You trouble me, Eric,"
taking out your issues with me on James.
Not your finest hour.
He isn't smart enough for you.
How can you still not see it?
"Being smart isn't everything, has it done for you just what you hoped?"
Punishing him makes no sense...
Because he doesn't know about us.
I'm not sure he needs to know.
Especially after the way you behaved today.
"I love him, so leave him alone."
I just couldn't put all the pieces together
Who could?
You.
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you.
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.
I still don't understand how he got in.
I wrote his essay for him.
Did you?
No.
"What, like you were honest with me, going behind my back"
To apply for the one thing I wanted more than anything?
The reason I couldn't talk to you earlier-
It's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.
"She's sick, and I don't know what's gonna happen."
It's not working exactly as I'd hoped.
I need you to write Lily another prescription.
I doubt the authorities
Would be pleased to know what you've been doing.
It's said that we're all strapped to fortune's wheel...
Nowhere is this truer
Than the ever-changing landscape of love.
As one couple enjoys an upswing...
Another is plunged downwards.
"But top or bottom, don't get too comfortable,"
Because the one thing you can rely on
Is that the wheel will keep on turning.
"All right, I'm heading to my mom's for breakfast."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You're coming in late and leaving early all week.
I'm starting to feel cheap.
"Oh, I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately."
Just with everything going so well with my dad-
"Hey, Serena, no worries."
Okay?
Mm.
"Look, I love being your crash pad,"
"But, you know, maybe you'd feel better if you moved back in"
With your mom while she's getting her treatment.
And have to see Jenny's lying face first thing in the morning?
"No, thank you."
"Always ask yourself, are there any hidden carbohydrates in the food you eat."
Watch fried foods.
"Now, whenever you do anything strenuous, check your pulse."
Do deep breathing exercises.
"Stay away from starches and sugars, and that's it."
"Now, if you will also supplement... with twice the adult minimum daily vitamin requirements... and do six and a half minutes of isometrics every day, it's easy, Bob."
Wouldn't it be easier if I just stopped eating?
"Yeah, that might work too."
"Hi, honey."
"- Hi, dear."
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
No munching.
"Bob, Is there something you're not telling me?"
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
Are we at war?
(low gurgling)
"Uh, you know I think it's that darn sophomore with the deviated septum."
He must have closed his mouth again.
"Sabrina, could you come up here?"
I think I might have an antacid.
What flavor?
Can I have two?
I always carry the essentials.
Let's see.
"No, that one's for leprosy."
"So, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me."
"Hand me that towel, will you?"
(phone rings) What?
Fire him.
Your son?
He's not a closer.
"Anyway, I hoped if I could tell you what a wonderful place my clock shop is, you would find it in your heart to spare it."
(chuckling):
That's a good one.
Spare it!
"Oh, who sent you in here, huh?"
Artie?
"You're serious, aren't you?"
You really think there's anything you could tell me to keep me from squashing you like a bug?
We put a lot of effort into our selection of timepieces.
"Oh, well, in that case,"
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to count all the way to three before I call security.
"Before I go, could I just make one little point?"
"Oh, look who's been downsized."
This stinks.
"If we're the only beings that are conscious of this universe, us looking up and appreciating it is a very good thing, right?"
Are we the only ones?
"If so, yes."
I'm almost certain we're the only ones.
"So if we're not conscious of it, it's meaningless, isn't it?"
Yes.
"If we occasionally look into space and think about it, then the universe will not be lonely."
You're so beautiful.
Thank you.
But I've been repeating this ever since I was very young.
It's just some words of nostalgia.
- Am I being too honest?
- It's alright.
"This may sound simplistic, but the really real thing that I have absolute faith in is the stars."
Stars?
"I don't quite understand, but you must explain it to me later."
Thanks for listening.
- Aren't you cold?
- Cold?
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Where the hell are you?
Are you with Director Kim?
"Yeah, we're taking a walk on the beach."
This late?
"It's so dark, you can't see a thing."
Where are you?
And why did you leave me behind?
We're just taking a walk.
You took so long in the bathroom.
That's why we left without you.
- Come join us.
Talking snow.
I love new things.
You are not of this world.
Takes one to SNOW one!
"Right, let's see."
"Multi-nucleate, crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it finds."
Looks like snow.
Isn't snow.
You must leave here now!
"Shut up, I'm making deductions, it's very exciting."
"Now, what are you, eh?"
A flock of space crystals?
A swarm?
"The snowmen are foot soldiers, mindless predators."
But you - you're the clever one.
You're Moriarty.
"So you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can, and when you've learnt enough, what do you do?"
You can't conquer the world using snowmen.
Snowmen are rubbish in July.
You'll have to be better than that.
You'll have to evolve.
"Sir, it appears to be stuck!"
What have you done?
Have you locked the doors?
"You need to translate yourself into something more, well, human."
Kick it down!
To do that you'd need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in ice form - where do you find that?
Get in here!
Quickly!
"I've got a master key somewhere, sir."
Let's see.
Most opened file...
"Oh, look what's happened to city property."
No... but I'm still gonna take you to school.
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.
You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity, we'd better do something about Tony's sister."
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
Telepathy.
She'll show up again and ruin everything.
"In that case, she will have to be, as you would say Scratched?"
Tia.
Tia.
What happened to you?
I can't explain now.
And now you think of something beautiful...
"Oh, my Lord."
it hurts so bad...
Bruno!
Check if the water's already boiling!
And bring the hot towels from the dryer!
A boy!
Where is he?
...And so I can only say:
my dear Mrs John... a la bonheur!
Thanks a lot.
"Look at it, Mr Hassenreuter:"
A seven-month-old child and already it looks just as big as my own.
"""Explain to me, Count Oerindur, this dilemma of nature!"""
"Why ""dilemma""?"
There is no dilemma!
"You're absolutely right, Mrs John."
With such a giant as father...
"Well, he'll be in for a surprise, right, Mrs John?"
Don't blow your smoke in my child's face!
Don't be surprised then if your child still looks like a seven month-old one.
That is not due to my smoking!
"That's all down to his father, that blue-blooded weakling who tried to prove that I couldn't bring up a child!"
But he lost the case yesterday.
I got full custody.
"- Well, I congratulate you."
- Thanks!
"Could we also look at the new one, Mrs John?"
"And the alimony too, 75 Mark monthly."
Learn to hate the alimonies that come from cultivated human hands!
"Little enough, when I consider that it was pure pleasure for these gentlemen, and for me just..."
"- Regardez les enfants, Madame Knobbe!"
I always wanted the good of Marie.
Are you looking for the fate of his mother.
But do
Two days after the board against the merchants of flesh guns and ideas?
And we try again with horses crazy.
"Mickey, you ..."
"The reserve, a thousand chances against one."
And the luxury of a desperate gambler.
Could I returned to Hungary but I prefer to leave in our world.
"I'm going to take the deposition of Mr. André, democratic, as a papal bull."
But I want to continue to follow your tracks.
And those of Marie.
Sharpening their teeth and shaking the handcuffs.
Gladly send you sterile with your coffin in Hungary.
You do not like me.
Fault ... her.
Marie is poor and defenseless.
She goes too far.
"Just so, innocent."
Remember that I am too generous with you.
As the same from me.
And this is my foot.
You know my foot?
A nice Calcione a hog foot Parisian.
And this in addition.
"So, courage, the man on the street with his suitcase."
So that if the steps even worse.
You still have all two ears?
"It is my fault, I would not have never had to leave you alone."
I like when bleed ...
But I would much that bloody for me.
"Curse you, Mary, full of ice."
And so early.
"Oh, Mr Reznik, I only wish all my tenants are considerate as you."
I will give you a receipt in the morning
"Good night, Mr. Reznik."
"Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me, but..."
Have you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment?
Has there been a burglary?
"No, no, no, nothing like that."
I just wondered if...
"You know, if... you noticed anything unusual lately?"
Unusual?
"Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike."
I am sorry to disturb you so late.
Good night.
What we know is this:
One:
Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.
Two:
Miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off.
"Three: the mill suddenly activates, catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this."
What's the fucking point?
"These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik."
Our job is to investigate these events from every possible angle...
So that we might prevent their recurrence.
So we'd appreciate it if you would be a bit more co-operative.
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.
"What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?"
I was distracted.
By what?
What distracted you?
"It was Ivan, I was watching Ivan on the pit."
"The whole thing is my fault, okay."
"My theory is that these creatures, aliens feed of people like we feed about other creatures, and that they need for substinance a substance similar to opiates, heroin is an opiate, so this one can hear for it but they found something better!"
That substance is produced in the brain during an orgasm and is similar in chemical structure to opiates.
It is the key to get this substance.
Why didn't he kill me?
Did you have an orgasm?
No!
"In the end, in the end..."
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
Over there...
In the end.
In the end come on now.
We can be together now.
Come out!
You can feed on me if you want.
It's OK.
I don't mind.
Now you care for me.
We can be happy.
I wanna make love with you.
No!
You can't leave me.
Don't leave without me.
No!
No!
"Excuse me, I'm in a tremendous rush, I can't make any stop"
I've got to go strait to the penthouse.
"The penthouse, that's the same as the roof, that's where I'm going."
Looks like Adrian is having a party.
Adrian?
Who's Adrian?
This isn't the roof.
Close.
"Well, these are the things he would talk about when he called."
"I'd ask him how he was, and... these are the things he would say."
You know what's nice about road trips?
This is a road trip?
They have these coffee shops that serve breakfast all night.
You want?
"I want breakfast, all night."
You wanted to know when the truck came in.
How's it look?
I had this little premonition some of it survived the journey...
- I guess they didn't.
"- Gladys, call the insurance."
"Hey, thanks for telling Joe."
What are you talking about?
He bought me champagne last night.
Champagne was his idea.
The back half of the truck is all perfect.
"We got, like, ten tons of good fruit back there."
Thanks.
"I guess some things can be saved, and some can't."
"Tell me, Tommy, I need to know."
What would you do?
I didn't go to business school.
All I got is my gut.
"Right now, I trust your gut more than my M.BA."
"Sarah, what is it?"
"Saul, I love what our family has built here, and I wanna keep it alive, not just for us, but for all the people who work here, people who trusted this family, who trusted this company."
I have the number here of a U.S. Attorney.
"I'll do it your way, six months."
"But, at the end of six months, if we haven't found our way out of this, I will call him."
OK.
Isn't it true?
"Every time I see him I wonder, ""he should've washed, he hasn't again."""
"I know what you mean, he doesn't seem to be neat."
He's like the coal maker's daughter who doesn't wash her neck.
I like it.
Maybe he just looks that way because his neck is a bit long.
I know!
But it doesn't look like he cleans that long neck!
"But still, he's really popular."
I wonder about that.
"He's too plain, there's nothing interesting there."
An actor needs to have an aura or force about them.
For example?
So Ji Sup.
It's Mr. So again.
But why were you late?
"Right, it's the first time you've been late since I started working here."
Did you overdo it last night?
- I didn't order this.
- You ordered the curry.
"No, I ordered the pork cutlet."
"I ordered the pork cutlet, so why are you giving me the curry?"
- You ordered the curry.
"- No, no, you got it wrong."
You must've switched our orders with another table.
You ordered the curry.
"Yes, you did."
I did?
"Yes, you ordered the curry."
I heard it too.
What are you talking about?
I definitely ordered the pork cutlet.
That's really something!
-Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
-Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes gIares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, Iet's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'II devote himself to flirting with clark's daughter.
will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to MendeI's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
Tony...
He's the owner of the delicatessen.
Saying that the voice was a mars.
"But, the below average height and the fact that the voice was disguised and it was muffled by the mask..."
All indicate at least the possibility of a doubt as to the gender.
"The lab is going to be running some more tests on that makeup, so I'll report tomorrow."
"You should be on salary, sir, with these hours."
I feel I am.
Good working with you.
Thank you.

"I guess I just got carried away, sir."
I hope you don't mind.
"No, no."
It's all right.
"These shoes, sir, they're really terrific."
"Now I know why, Lieutenant Lucerne, he always look so tall."
"Yes, well, I would appreciate a certain amount of discretion in that matter, Lieutenant."
"Public image, you know."
"Oh, right, sir."
"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about a thing, sir."
"As far as I'm concerned, you're four inches taller than I am."
And that's the end of it.
"Thank you, Lieutenant Columbo."
"My pleasure, Lieutenant Lucerne."
"Sir, I got the second lab report on the mask, so I hurried right over."
Yes?
"It turns out that it probably isn't a woman, sir."
"You see, it was actor's makeup."
"Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know, in case something popped up."
'Cause she misses us.
PATTON:
Agent Gregorio!
Hey!
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Let's pretend you didn't.
I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.
Good luck!
I thought she hated beignets.
She does.
"So, we got four robberies, all connected to the racing circuit, marked money in Jared's garage."
Neither Russ or Dana are talking.
Hard not to think that they're the bank robbers.
"Yeah, except Dana seemed more scared than guilty."
Check Jared's leave record.
See where he was on each of the robberies.
Copy that.
"Hey, you might want to check, see if any of 'em are cyber geeks."
I dove into the specifics of how they manipulated that car crash.
"Whoever did it, they are good."
I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.
"Yeah, but..."
it wasn't Jared.
"According to the marines, he was TDY on three of the four robberies."
So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.
Maybe he found out about it and tried to do the right thing and got killed before he could.
Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed or why Dana was too scared to talk.
Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?
This time with a warrant.
(keys jingle)
"You know, force them to hand it over."
- We're not even sure if...
- One more round of betting and
- I'm cashing us out.
- You're the boss.
I was just trying to keep her distracted.
We're clear.
I want him.
- Sorry?
- You follow the girl.
I'll stay here and I'll call you if he comes out.
- Are you sure?
- I can handle him if there's trouble.
All right.
- I'll call you if I catch anything.
- Do that.
"Artie, I know you're not as sure about this as you're pretending."
I'm not pretending.
You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing?
What happens if that mirror is reflected and it's something like the Studio 54 disco ball?
Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction?
Something completely unexpected?
I don't know.
What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of the Alice's mirror?
I think we know what happens.
Do we really?
- Could reflections switch places?
- Could people?
She pulls to the right.
Pardon?
I noticed it a couple months ago.
"When Myka's mad at me, she pulls to the right."
I couldn't sleep myself.
"Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find Beatrix here but I want you to believe..."
"All I can believe is that your ideas are not normal, Jekyll, not fit..."
"Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix to come here tonight because..."
"No, Harry."
"Father, I know my being here is difficult to understand, but I'm not ashamed."
"Then, my dear, I shall be for you, because I do understand."
We leave for the Continent tomorrow on the boat train.
"Father, please."
"Oh, come, Sir Charles."
"After all, you could eliminate all this difficulty if you'd set an early date for our marriage."
You don't understand.
We're very much in love.
We wanna be together.
- We don't wanna wait any longer.
"- Please, Father."
"In view of what's happened, the engagement should be broken off."
"However, I'll be lenient."
We shall see you on our return.
"Come, my dear."
"Father, I've never disobeyed you in my life."
"But, Harry, if you don't want me to leave I'll refuse."
- Beatrix.
"- I mean it, Father."
"I don't want you to go, Bea and I can't agree with your father's decision, but I know he's thinking of your happiness."
I can't argue against that and I can't ask you to.
"- That's highly commendable, Harry."
Will you see us off at the train?
Better have two engines.
I might try to hold it back.
Try.
Try anyway.
When did that happen?
In the womb would be my guess.
Any chance we may bump into your old coworkers?
"Or even Wendy, perhaps?"
Wendy and I decided to leave it alone for now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Turns out Ol' Blue Eyes was wrong.
Love isn't always lovelier the second time around.
"In fact, it's kind of painful and strange."
- Yabba.
"- Enough chit-chat, Ziva."
A man's got to work.
- McGee.
- Wallet was found near the body.
No cash.
Victim is Caleb Adams.
"23, petty officer second class on the DD-350 Hagen."
It's a destroyer docked for liberty at Chesapeake Bay.
Check for surveillance in the area.
Those two with him?
They said they found him this way.
I'm still getting the details.
Doc?
Abrasions on his hands and face indicate the possibility of a fight which was ended by this single stab wound.
Ugly.
"That's it, Tony?"
Only one word?
No wisecracks about wayward sailors on shore leave?
No obscure On the Town references?
Is that a movie?
I understand that sailors often refer to this liberty as their annual beer-and-crabs week.
"We didn't know what it was, but people were terrified."
"Hurry, get in the house."
I went with some of the other men to investigate.
"We found the wreckage, a few wounded survivors."
We didn't know what they were.
We decided to take no chances.
"We slaughtered them, burned the bodies."
Wise decision.
"Unfortunately we didn't get them all, and although none of us saw it, evidently, one of them survived."
It took its first victim that very night.
"We tried to hunt it down, but we couldn't find it."
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
"Two years after the crash, it took my own son."
That's it?
"One wraith, in the forest?"
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"We'll all go together, in the daylight."
You're really going to help us?
"Well, like the man said, it's just one wraith."
It'd be downright unneighborly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
"Uh, well, let's not forget the food."
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daimos?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads, and it can turn you to stone just by looking at you."
"Well, you heard wrong."
"Good, good... that's what I like, willing footmen."
Bend over.
"""Oh, they're so naughty!"""
Early scientists also used kites in an attempt to harness electricity from lightning.
Foxsmith is preparing a tribute to these brave men.
He's also hoping to generate a spark among the group.
"So, are you going to go for Everett then or what, Miss Hopkins?"
No.
No?
No.
Why is my love life the topic of today's discussion?
- Really.
- I'm sorry.
"I just I mean,"
"I'm quite happy being single, thanks."
I think Mr. Everett's great.
He has a heart of gold.
He's just an all-around great guy.
This place is like living in a fairy tale... and...
"I could see myself being swept up in it all and... it scares me... it really, really scares me."
Kite makers...
"Sorry, I was on my way to my bath and a letter's arrived which I thought we'd all like to hear."
It's rather good news.
"Um, it's from our friend Mr. Carrington."
Who is coming back to join us.
"He enjoyed his time so much at Kentchurch over the weekend that ""I can't wait to get back there and be amongst such illustrious company."""
So isn't that good news?
Very good news.
Everyone happy?
"You know, it'll be nice to have some music back in the house."
And that's the only reason?
"And a nice, happy, smiling face."
People actually cheered for us.
- How about the Hansons?
"- Yeah, the Hansons."
Killed them.
Didn't see them put one in the net.
"Hey, I looked for you after the game."
What game?
All I saw was a wrestling match.
Got to give people what they want.
"Put butts in seats, win the vote."
Yeah?
"Well, keep playing that way, you won't be seeing this butt in the seats any more."
Interesting style of play.
"Had to let them know we meant business, sir."
That's how it was when I was a boy.
Hard-nosed hockey.
"I admire you, kid."
I do.
"But if all this is about the vote on your home,"
I don't see much hope in hockey changing their minds.
What if I told you we already changed one?
A big one.
"It seems these boys have been inspired by rumours that Mayor David Kenneth plans to support their petition to save the Newman Home when he returns from his vision quest in Peru, if he ever returns at all."
"Man, that's awesome."
I can't believe this!
I want names.
Good newsman never reveals his sources.
There isn't a good newsman within 50 miles of here.
"I'm just trying to capture the spirit of the thing, Bernie."
Is it true?
"Well, no, no, no, no, hang on a tick."
Our office was not contacted for this story and the mayor is unreachable.
From our Gyula's life there is a word.
Do not make a fuss already.
- Okay
Did you send him in into his house?
- Yes.
- Wrong.
I said that it is not allowed to be in consideration of me.
This pine smell.
This ozone.
"You do not know it, what this means to me."
"After the a on frontline service filled of 9 monthly,in intolerable noise and smelliness,"
"I cannot to say it, how much I am glad about your kind invitation."
"Well yet we, how we are glad."
"Terrific to thought to it, that what you may suffer there on the front."
My Gyula. my son.
It is not necessary to be worried about his.
"I take it beside myself as soon as the cold season begins, into the flag office heated well."
Kind major lord.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
- How we say thank you for this the for major lord?
How we gratitude?
Thankfully i owe for the kind hospitality.
"Because I was like that already, than the chased game."
Be calm.
The your Gyula son's will be your good place beside me.
He loved that little limping child the best.
Himself bought it because of that always beside it.
Was not clever though.
He said it.
Onto your kind Gyula son's health.
- Thank you very much.
"- Thank you very much, major lord."
"And I'm sorry, but I-I can't back out now."
Okay.
So you're just gonna live your life keeping secrets again?
- This isn't like that.
- How is it not like that?
You're keeping this from Harvey.
And Harvey kept things from Jessica.
Look at how that turned out.
"I tell Harvey now, and it's the same as if he catches me."
"The case gets tossed, and all of the people we're trying to help keep getting abused."
It's the same as before.
"No, Rachel, this is not the same as when I was a fraud."
And I'll tell you something else...
"I used to have trouble sleeping at night, but I sleep like a baby now because I am helping these people."
"I'm sorry, but that's the word that I'm keeping."
Good morning.
Hey.
Did you sleep well?
"If you consider eight hours of bliss sleeping well, then, yes, I slept very well."
But now I have to go.
- Wait.
"- Harvey, I have patients."
"I know, but..."
I wanted to get your opinion on something.
What have you done this time?
I haven't told Donna we're seeing each other yet.
Why not?
"Come on, you know my history with her."
We're working together.
I just promoted her.
"That's more an excuse than a reason, isn't it?"
I don't want to create a problem when there isn't one.
The Cult... of Solon.
Splendid.
"Yes, uh, the Cult, or descendents of the Cult, uh, lived peacefully in England for hundreds of years, and that is until the Romans invaded and then they were hunted down and slaughtered."
"But a few... survivors escaped, uh, with the Ark and the Torch, and sailed from England."
And came to these catacombs.
And then died.
But not before hiding the Torch somewhere down here.
I'd bet my life on it.
"Them's some pretty high stakes, professor."
"Let's hope you don't lose that bet, huh?"
"Oh, relax, my boy."
The soldiers don't even know the catacombs are here.
Colonel Petrovic...
Well...
Wa...
This must be the oldest part of the catacombs.
These must be the remains of early Christians who hid from the Romans.
"Over centuries, others followed, like the Cult..."
of Solon.
"Professor, please."
"Let's skip the lecture, find what we came for and get out of here."
There's a civil war going on upstairs.
"Oh, nonsense, United Nations ordered a cease-fire."
"Yeah, well, I don't think they care."
"Oh, these people never got on."
They've been waging war amongst themselves since the 12th century.
"When I find the Torch of Truth, we can use it to continue Solon's quest, and find the Treasure of Atlantis, and there won't be any more wars."
I can feel it.
I know it.
We're close.
Professor...
The Sigma.
"Ganz, I've got your man."
Shrubbery and ground's all in good shape.
- What rent is it bringing in?
- Just enough to pay the taxes.
But it's a valuable property.
"Surely, you could loan me 15,000 on it."
"You know, Douglas it was father's wish that you keep the place."
"Yes, I know."
"I hate to take a chance on losing it, it's all I have left."
But I've got to have the money.
But the theater business is an outright gamble.
Anything is a gamble to a fellow who doesn't know his oats.
But I think I know something about the theater.
There's a wide difference between college plays and Broadway productions.
"But one has to start somewhere, and there doesn't seem to be any room for me at the bottom."
So I'll start at the top.
"Alright, take your positions, girls."
Music.
[piano music]
Come ahead.
"Wait a minute, where's Gambarelli?"
She's supposed to enter with her father.
(male #1) 'She's coming.'
"Well, tell her to hurry up, Mr. Ganz is waiting."
I'm afraid you won't get much idea of the number this way.
We expect it to be one of the highlights of the show.
"Chowsky, explain how you're putting it on."
"With pleasure, Mr. Ganz."
"The setting is a magnificent art saloon with terrific big pictures all around, very lovely."
Gambarelli is coming with her father to sell his paintings.
I see.
"Visualize it, Tyler."
I was trying to piece together what happened that night she disappeared.
- He helped me fill in the blanks.
- What blanks?
He reminded me that I'd stopped by his dressing room during the intermission.
Reminded you?
You don't remember?
"Well, it was the first night back from the tour."
"Everything was so hectic, I..."
Did he remind you what you talked about?
Why are you taking this sarcastic tone with me?
Because it sounds like he was planting a false memory in your mind in order to come up with an alibi for himself.
An alibi?
Why would...
You think Philip killed her.
You are insane!
I can't listen to this.
I can't!
Planted memory.
Maybe we can turn it into probable cause.
"I'm warning you, doctor, if you faint, I'm not responsible."
I'll try to control myself.
"By the way, your production of Aida five years ago, one of the best nights of my life."
Lennie Briscoe took me.
Do you know how many singers I've led in that role?
"Tebaldi, Price, Milanov, Caballe."
What's this underneath the makeup?
A boil or something.
Looks like a bite mark.
- Human bite.
- That's not possible.
Don't move.
I need to take a photo.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
But you told Chloe.
Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby.
She's a good friend.
Excuse me.
Chase?
You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I'm just as confused as you are."
But all I know is that I love you.
"And I'm falling in love with Angela, too."
And I need to make this work.
Go on.
What's happening with Nina in interrogation?
They're getting something.
What?
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought.
"You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol."
Tony knows what he's doing.
"Okay, fine."
"Look, I need to get together with Chloe."
I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation.
Not yet.
"Ryan, look, you're wasting my time."
"Now, I humored you with the physical."
"And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here.
She wants to talk to you.
"- Well, this is not the time."
"- Actually, it is."
"You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
"Well, I don't think that the sky should be the limit."
But I do think that... magazines offer an escape in innovation and...
I hope to always hope to find fantasy and novelty...
- on the pages of Skirt.
"- Thank you, just as I thought."
"Thank you, but fantasy doesn't come cheap, sweetheart."
"Please, I don't wanna hear the ""c"" word."
"- Hello, darlings."
- Don't you dare throw that away.
Don't you know people are starving at Vogue?
- Take it.
"- Jocelyn, did you finish testing... all of the mousse in the closet?"
"I was almost done, I just wanted to grab a bite."
"Charmingly naive, but don't you think problems are so important... that you shouldn't take time for lunch?"
"Besides... if you haven't noticed, these are all editors."
"Take it easy, Antoniette."
Be nice to her She's the best intern you've ever had.
Over here!
I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.
You blew it.
They got you again.
"Cock-sucking, hussie, cocks'n pants..."
"I know, but I need your help."
Is there gonna be another leak?
"- And if so, what's story?"
"- Think deeper, think FDR."
"East River Drive, traffic jams..."
- squeegee boys.
- Think deeper...
- think tacky blond bombshell.
- Sharon Stone.
But if you deal with something else steadily meanwhile...
This is totally vainness.
Waste of time.
"I learned it on the front at my own crew, what the fact that somebody finds the time to think means."
"The one like this becomes the plaything of their own thought and they are due so then, than Tót lord."
The red one is spotted with a butterfly.
"I get true one in everything the respected for major lord, but I believe it so, it is not possible to prevent it if something wants to occur to the man."
But could be.
Why not could be.
It is necessary to modify the circumstances only.
And this our start goes by.
What there is an obstacle to this?
You understand it the thought procession?
I believe it yes.
Well...
I do not take something here and there yet.
"Me, too only here and there."
"Oh, be thinking now, Tót."
"Well, Tót?"
Did something occur to you already?
Yes.
Now.. something...
But no.
"You like thinking though, Tót."
It is an occasion here now.
"Here you go, Tót."
There is time now.
"You think onto our Gyula and strain the your sluggish brain, my good Lajos."
Do not whisper Ágika!
"I do not whisper, major lord."
"Unbutton your jacket, if some more comfortable."
- Maybe then now.
Let's see what we find here.
"All right, looks like your basic super model diet."
"Diet pills, vodka, cigarettes."
Gabriel.
At least this confirms that she was here.
- No sign of a struggle.
- No sign of anything.
- What about blood?
- No.
All right.
"Well, I guess we're done here."
Somebody's coming.
Hey!
Hi!
"If you guys were planning a party, you could have at least put me on the guest list."
"All right, who's going to tell me what's going on?"
- It's best if you don't know.
- Best if I don't know what?
Telling you would kind of defeat the purpose of 'it's best if you don't know'.
"Okay, you two have been skulking around the city for two days."
I want to know what's going on.
I can't believe neither of them would tell me what was going on!
This is a little hard to picture.
Mike and Henry are hanging out..
"No, not just hanging out, they're working together."
They're investigating that fashion model murder.
You know what drives me crazy?
They didn't even want me involved.
"They didn't want my help, nothing."
"Yeah, there's nothing worse than when you find out somebody close to you doesn't trust you."
"It's not the same thing, Coreen."
Of course not.
"The killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control the gunrunning business in London."""
Where are you from again?
Hampshire CID.
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allowed Jacob Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for certain strategic reasons is information you might want to lose from your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Well, I must admit, talking to yourself and others, it seems your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner not Simmonds.
Have you seen that film?
What film?
The Untouchables.
Great film.
It's a great film.
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"They put one of ours in a hospital, we put one of theirs in a morgue."
- Right
- Iain...
A green light's on in the car like a little green exclamation mark.
Probably needs a service.
It's brand new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
Do you want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
So what's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
So we won't make any hasty conclusions.
"There is no evidence, nor are there any witnesses."
Oh...
There is one thing.
I told you before...
That if I find out that you made any money from anything outside of your job
I will make sure to have you fired.
Three million won per week...
In my 30 years in the police force...
This is my first time seeing...
A man as ridiculous as you.
"Hong Gyu Man, a secretary-general, three years ago."
"Jung Soo Hyuk, Team Leader of the mission in Macau, three years ago."
Park Seon Woo of Yong Moon Plan.
"Yoon Sang Min, who is building the Hallyu Core Mall."
The man who ordered for the Macau mission to be aborted.
And this man executed that plan.
An intimate relationship in which they help each other.
"Bay Star Hong Kong, who took over Korean Commerce Bank."
And I heard that there were...
"strong Koreans, backing them up."
"Behind the Hallyu Core Mall, there are many investors."
Among them...
Bay Star Hong Kong.
In terms of industries that require proper licensing from the government
Bay Star Hong Kong is involved in almost all of them.
They're very impressive...
but that's why it's risky.
"Does Bay Star Hong Kong have a direct relationship with Yoon Sang Min, or not?"
"The main investor of Hallyu Core Mall, is Lockfield Infra Investment."
The representative is Kang Moon Soo.
Grandson to the owner of Kyunghee Bank.
Fantastic.
A truly great sleep.
"On the scale of one to five - 5,429,562."
Sleeping face down in the toilet is conducive to restful slumber?
And why shouldn't I sleep in the lavatory?
You wet the bed.
Once.
I had a nightmare that I was ordinary and untalented and there was a momentary aberration.
It's a sign of an extra-vivid subconscious.
It's a sign of an extra-drippy tiddler.
"Eddie, I was having a nightmare that I was a pleb."
It was a horrifying experience.
I remember the night so well.
I awoke to hear Richie screaming into the middle of the night.
"""Ah. "" His heart-rending sobs echoing round the house."
"Why, you wept like a soul in torment."
"I rushed in to find poor, frightened Richie shivering, terrified, white, sitting in a puddle."
"- Yes, and what did you do?"
- I don't remember.
You switched on my electric blanket.
Only to take your mind off the nightmare.
You completely electrocuted my love truncheon.
Love truncheon?
"Love pencil, more like."
"Well, love pin, actually."
"Eddie, what's this?"
- I don't know.
- It's one of my scary looks.
Is it really?
My intimidating frown.
So you just watch out.
Has the hair grown back yet?
You guys are harassing me because of Facebook?
That T-shirt has 3400 friends and six people posted pictures of you wearing it tonight.
Apparently it's one of a kind.
From like a three-year-old collection.
"I got it from this Asian girl, Kai, I'd seen around the clubs."
She was at that place on Sunset Plaza next to Chin Chin.
She had these shopping bags full of clothes.
I just really wanted it.
Chelsea-Colin photos have hit the Web.
"""Robbery Love Triangle."""
I ran DMV for Asian girls named Kai in the right age and weight range.
Our girl in the stolen T-shirt picked this one.
Kai Ng.
Hmm.
Say our crew flagged Colin and Chelsea at The Edison.
"Stands to reason if Kai was one of the burglars, she'd be at The Edison too."
Sounds like we should talk to the guy that took that photo.
I shoot HD video.
It's revolutionary.
"I sell stills, video, I get it all, I miss nothing."
There.
There's your girl.
Nice-looking blonde.
Part of the gang?
Show him the sketch.
What about this guy?
You ever see him?
Sure.
I know ten boys look just like him.
"Come with me to Mother Lode, I'll find you 20."
"What about this, what if we gave you a list of the other victims, could you see if you have footage of any of them on the nights their homes were robbed?"
You would give me a first dibs call on future break-ins?
Mrs. hall!
Go on to your basket now.
"Oh, I'm disgusted with you."
Go on.
Mrs. hall!
"- I heard you the first time, Mr. farnon."
How did he get out?
I've asked you to keep the gate shut.
"Aye, you have."
- He nearly ended up under the wheels of my car.
"While the hole stays in fence, dogs will stray-- the hole?"
!
- So either you or Mr. Tristan must mend it.
"Till then, you've got nothing you can complain about, have you?"
Tristan...
You almost left it too late.
"Stick that round his neck, would you, please?"
He was running with that bunch at far field.
I had no idea it had gotten to this state.
"Wooden tongue, is it?"
"Yes, that's right-- actinobacillosis, to be absolutely accurate."
"It you don't catch it in time, the tongue hardens, and they starve to death."
"Can you do aught for him, you reckon?"
"Mmm, fortunately."
"There's a new treatment, Mr. Abbot-- sodium iodide."
It's a vast improvement on the old system-- painting the tongue with iodine.
Hello.
What do you want?
"Come to keep an eye on things, haven't you, lass?"
It's vital you get some nourishment into him.
Milk or gruel will do until the injection starts to work.
"If he'll drink it, that'll do him the most good."
Should have told me you were doing this.
I didn't have the time.
I was with George until one hour ago.
You spent the day with him?
"Yes and every night this week, so far."
I am becoming the expert in George Browne and the Blackmire Group.
"I could be making living at it, no?"
You are doing some very risky things without telling me.
And I have serious concerns about that.
You don't want me to tell you what he is doing?
You don't want... the briefcase?
I want you to inform me of when you see him before you see him.
And I want to debrief you at regular intervals.
You are working under my direction.
Do you understand that?
"Well, if I am working for you full time... then I need to get paid for it."
"I still owe money to Katarina and... if I can't work for her because I'm working for you, then... she needs to get paid."
And... you need to leave.
He is going to be here in 5 minutes.
We'll talk about all this tomorrow.
You're gonna call me first thing.
"- That is him now, probably."
- Is the wire up and running?
It will be.
Come on up.
"In the morning, first thing."
Take the stairs!
"There's not much here, just some small talk."
"No mention of the Blackmire Group, at all."
Then they get into bed.
Did he mention anything about his briefcase?
He wasn't interested in his briefcase.
Flippa!
(retching)
"What gives, brah?"
You're supposed to be my GPS.
"Sorry, cuz, I got seasick."
I see why our navigation system's on the fritz.
"Well, leaving your first mate in charge of the liquor may not have been the most prudent move."
"Don't sweat it, Doc."
I got an auxiliary engine just for this situation.
(engine whining)
I assume you checked that the battery was charged before we set sail.
This thing has a battery?
Mayday.
Mayday.
This is the SS Thong Magnet needing emergency assistance.
And I'm afraid the radio is powered by the battery as well.
And we lost cell service a few hours ago.
Why are you so calm about this?
"Well, I project outward confidence as a way of coping with stress."
"Inside, I'm terrified."
We're gonna die out here.
Nobody's dying on my watch.
All we got to do is send a distress signal up.
Coast Guard will come and tow us to shore.
(clicking)
"You got to be kidding me, brah."
Must be a safety-- give it here.
"Sure, let the drunk guy handle the firearm."
Great idea.
"Everyone chill, I got this."
"Well, there's no missing that."
I heard you got something.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- What're you doing?
- Thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas with Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"You do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us to penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
We'll have an army with us!
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.
That's why I was deluged with all those letters.
"- Bea, now look..."
"- Oh, I know."
But if I ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill...
"Oh, don't you see how much more worried that would make me?"
It all amounts to this.
"February is a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen..."
"If you don't stop looking at me like that, I won't be responsible for what happens."
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
"- Oh, here you are."
"Sir Charles, glad to see you."
Sorry you weren't in.
You look fine.
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.
"Sorry to be late, my dear."
In an argument at the club.
What's on the program?
"I thought we'd go to Stewart's, if that's agreeable."
Excellent!
"But, while it's on my mind, Harry there's something we must straighten out."
I've gone through enough with Beatrix over this.
"I may be getting old and crotchety, but I won't put up with it anymore."
I'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible.
"Oh, Father!"
"Well, Sir Charles, that's..."
"Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:"
"Wedding at St. Margaret's, Bishop Manners, reception."
"Oh, God."
So inappropriate.
Can you quit staring at me like I'm a hot fudge sundae?
"- Got a boyfriend, little sis?"
- You got a girlfriend?
"I did, but we broke up."
Tell me about it.
"Well, maybe I can help you get back with her."
"Boss, I'm at Makani's address."
"When I badged him, he tried to rabbit."
"Okay, come over here."
Didn't get real far.
What did he tell you about Dawkins?
Makani runs a fake ID mill out of the back of his shop.
Dawkins was in here about an hour ago.
He picked up a driver's license and a passport under the name of Carl Isner.
Update H.P.D. on the new alias.
Make sure Homeland Security adds it to their no-fly list.
Do you always have to walk so fast?
That's Dawkins' girlfriend.
"Uh, you know, um, your sister, she, uh, wasn't what I expected."
"I mean, aside from her hereditary aversion to neckwear, she seemed to be cool."
Are you saying I'm not cool?
"Well, in certain situations, like when you got a gun pointing in your face, or trying to decide whether to cut the blue wire or the red wire, you're good."
"But human interaction, mammal to mammal, room for improvement."
- That's all I'm saying.
"- Thank you, Dr. Phil."
- Can I get you guys something?
"- Yeah, Walton Dawkins."
Excuse me?
"Well, yeah."
"First, Walton Dawkins, but then I would love some blueberry pancakes."
"Every single hair gone, one by one, from worrying-- worrying about getting you passes, worrying about protecting your rights."
"And now, for the first time in ten years, when he's got a chance to prove to his old buddies that he's a success, a master sergeant, he can't go to that reunion."
Why?
Because his own platoon is too cheap to raise a few meas...
"Corporal Henshaw, do not beg them."
Let them search their own soul.
"Just remember him with this head of hair, gone from worrying."
'Cause he's the kind of a sergeant that worries about his men day and night.
All we're asking is a measly few bucks.
"-Now, look, come on now."
-Come on...
-You got a couple of bucks.
-I tell you no!
I can't spare another truck!
But I need another truck.
This is an emergency.
Call the Automobile Club.
Very funny.
The garbage is piling up behind my kitchens.
What am I going to do?
Learn to cook;
you won't have so much garbage.
Why don't you turn blue?
"Oh, knock it off."
Hey...
"Well, this is a gay little sorority meeting."
Mother Bilko's little chickens got nothing to do?
"Hey, Sowici, hold it."
You may have some extra guys for KP any minute now.
"Now, listen, you meatheads..."
"Ernie, Ernie, I was just giving 'em tomorrow's work detail."
Work detail?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
I want to know what your intentions are.
Excuse me?
- ln regards to Rick Sammler.
"- Well, I like him as a friend."
Are you capable of being serious?
"Karen, this is a sealed investigation."
You think I could answer a question like that?
We know he had nothing to do with conspiring to suborn judges or anyone.
You know him that well?
I want to know he's not going to be indicted.
That's not up to me.
It's up to 1 6 people who will make that decision.
- Whom you will influence.
- lf they're not prejudiced or idiots.
- Whom you will influence.
"- Karen, I... I don't want to say how much I actually like you, so I won't, but... I'm sorry."
I believe in what I do just as you believe in what you do.
"I swore an oath, which I spent a lot of years upholding, and I cannot stop now, and I wouldn't ask you to, either."
And I would completely understand if you were to walk away with those right now.
"Go home, chief."
"[Amanda] Oh, hi."
How are you?
"Well, you know, he's back there."
"My name is Ozymandias, King of kings."
"Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."
"I'm sorry, Rick."
Truly sorry.
"And that's a word I don't say very often, believe me."
"What are you sorry for, Miles?"
Bend closer to each other!
"I can't, that paunch..."
"Mummy, look how she dances."
Dad's like a sea wolf.
So slow?
You could do one of those amorous dances.
I wouldn't have anyone to do it with.
So that's what you mean by an amorous dance?
"Yes, on the same spot."
You see!
Then this hand must go somewhere else.
Like this?
In my pocket?
"Yes, to get your purse."
They teach you to dance that?
Then show us how you think it should be.
"You must stand on the spot, just slowly moving and swaying..."
Then I'll be your boy.
I'm the boy and you must slowly sway...
Do you remember how we practised that polka with Mi?
ka?
I didn't like her then.
Then she wanted that tango.
"Goodness, she was encouraging me to get so close, so amorous, body to body."
Seriously!
Some shake-up dance like the tango suits her better than a polka.
"Goodness, what do you see in it?"
"There are emotions in the tango, the impression of being in love."
"Heavens, what emotions are you talking about?"
What do you know about being in love?
"Not me, but I think it applies to her."
"Goodness, you'd do better to buy her that material for a dress!"
And my adventures in this life won't mean anything... because you will have seduced my soul... and drawn me into your world.
"Goodbye, Tom."
Has his weight been varying much here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
"All right, Tom."
Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
"I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn."
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
"If this thing works the way I designed it... you should fall absolutely straight, stop, and make a half-turn to the right."
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
"Christ, you ain't going to drown me, are you?"
No.
You just step onto the platform... and your weight will activate a water valve... that finally springs the trap.
"All right, step back inside."
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
"You suppose that's what I've been doing all these years, Sam?"
"Don't ask me that, Tom."
Bring the scales.
"Come on, Mr. Julian."
Oh.
"Ah, we're almost done, aren't we, cock?"
"See you, mate."
Yeah.
You know what my first act will be when I run this country?
Make threesomes compulsory?
OK.
But my second act will be to abolish five-day weather forecasts and publicly execute those who give them.
Some might say extreme.
"No, Sunday night, some guy who believes he has a personality 'cause he wears a bow tie says,"
"'It's galoshes day Monday, folks!"
'
Then this lunatic pretends to tell me the weather for the next five days.
Folks might find this useful in the planning of a week.
"Well, folks would be deceived, because by Tuesday night, bow tie has changed his forecast for two of the five nights but won't admit it."
"Your point being if it's a five-day weather forecast, how come he changes his mind every night?"
"Clearly, he can't, you know."
Kill him.
"Compassionately, but yes."
I'm sorry but um...
"What have you come as, eh?"
What's the emergency?
Where's hero-sorry-tax boy?
I just abandoned him at Parliament House.
It was unbearable.
They want him to run.
"Oh, God, strike at my vitals."
What am I doing?
This is mad.
I should go.
"Come on, I just hauled my arse halfway across town."
I'm sorry.
"And third of all, sex in public never goes according to plan."
That's true.
You always just realize how much gravel there is in the world.
"All right, nice and calm, hand over your wallet and your purse."
"Okay, man, look, just take it easy, okay, I..."
Wow.
"Oh, my God, thank God you're okay!"
Are you okay?
"I don't know, my girlfriend stood me up at a mugging."
I can't believe you just stayed with him.
I didn't just stay with him.
"He's not an injured bird, Whit."
He kind of made my attendance mandatory.
"Okay, why didn't you call me?"
"Ah, the mugger wouldn't let me borrow the phone that he mugged from me."
Why did you run?
That's what you're supposed to do.
That is not at all what you're supposed to do.
Even the mugger thought that was weird.
"Everybody knows that when a couple gets mugged, you're supposed to run in opposite directions."
He can't shoot both of you.
"No, just the guy still standing there next to him."
I thought you knew what to do.
I do.
You do whatever the guy with the gun is telling you to do.
"Give me the phone, I need to call the police."
Why?
We're fine.
I'm not fine!
I was mugged!
Because you didn't run.
It's like you have the brain of a deer.
"Here's a sight for thee, look thee"

"And Perdita, now grown in grace, a shepherd's daughter."
"Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son?"
"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince."
I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd
"A man, they say, that from very nothing is grown into an unspeakable estate."
"I have heard, sir, of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note."
- Thou shalt accompany us to the place.
- I bear your command.

We don't even know who she is.
Could she be a prostitute?
Whoa!
"Mrs. Stein isn't gonna like hearing that,suzanne."
"Neither is this woman, whoever she is."
"I mean hypothetically, if the woman is a hooker,"
She could have rolled stein for his money.
"What is this,aruba?"
We're just making theories up.
Americans have a right to a fair trial.
"Actually,ron's right."
"At this point,"
"We don't know what she is,"
And we don't know if she was involved in this.
She has to be involved.
Witnesses saw her with stein.
I hear stein had a terrible temper.
Did anyone else hear that or know anybody who was a victim of that?
Maybe the poor girl was defending herself.
I don't remember.
How long did you two date?
We didn't date.
I'd see him at parties and premieres and award shows.
Beats going to keggers at frat houses.
That's the great thing about going to college here
Is that you can go to all that hollywood stuff.
"I'd see stein at these things,"
"And he would flirt with me and ask me out,"
And i always said no.
"Until you said ""yes."""
We just went to dinner a couple times.
That's all.
A trauma brought on by my own father!
My life changed forever that day.
You sacrificed me for the traveler.
Why?
"Who is it, dad?"
Who is it?
!
"What if I told you now, that you are the traveler?"
You're right.
Your life truly changed that day.
I told you in the helicopter that you were destined for a great future.
"That's why I've been so hard on you, trained you so relentlessly."
"Think, Lex."
You have survived mortal injuries so many times.
How else can you explain it?
Because I was trained never to accept defeat.
"When I get my hands on that box in Zurich,"
I have a feeling all my questions will be answered.
I know how strong it is...
The attraction of the dark power.
But it will destroy you.
I can't let you go down that terrible path.
I can't open it... because I need a second key.
Give it to me.
I've swept every possible place you could have hidden it.
"And I finally realized, there's only person you would trust it with."
Yourself.
"If you open that box, if you get hold of that secret,"
there will be no redemption for you.
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
He's not competent to make this decision.
We're not praying.
"We're taking the medication, and we're gonna get you home."
And you're gonna be all better.
Shh.
This stuff is hard to come by...
Psilocybin cubensis.
Where did you get it?
From a colleague running a clinical trial.
I have to send back what's left over.
I'm packing it into a gelatin capsule.
The trick is to get just the right amount.
It lessens the chance of a bad reaction.
Great.
Here's the leftovers.
- Put them in a safe place.
"- Thanks, I appreciate it."
My pleasure.
"Most people experience some nausea, but don't worry."
It soon passes.
I've set you up with five hours' worth of beautiful music.
- Ah.
"- Listening to music helps, so..."
Can I have the remote?
Thank you.
"Manuel will be standing by at all times with a tranquilizer, so if there's anything that feels uncomfortable or you feel any fear, you... you just speak up."
"- You say so, all right?"
- All right.
Okay.
How's the volume?
You let me know if there's any problems right away.
"Well, it's real sweet of you to keep coming here for lunch."
"People tryin' to make an honest buck, weary travelers just lookin' for a bucket of wings, maybe an ice-cold beer."
You read the brochure.
I'm glad somebody did.
What's your point?
"My point, jefe, is that I doubt this place turns into a feeding' frenzy at midnight, am I right?"
This is a place of business.

So where is Richard?
How the hell should I know?
Because hermanos know.
I just came back from seeing my own brother for the first time in eons.
Pobre pendejo thought he could hide from me.
"Was still the same filthy son of a bitch he always was, but I'd forgotten how strong that bond could be."
Like we shared something crudo in the blood.
Except I didn't come here to talk about Richard.
"Why did you come, Mr. Gecko?"
I came to make a deal.

Make it through a dinner and don't piss him off.
He was saying stupid things.
So you go and corner his girlfriend?
- She's hiding something.
"- Oh, God."
She doesn't fuckin' matter!
It took 1 0 days.
I didn't ask questions.
Should I have?
"You know, I was once a boy scout myself."
We brought concrete from Indiana.
I don't remember a sales tax.
"Was there one, or was it made to dematerialize?"
How come the union allowed us to use 50 mechanics when their contract stipulated 1 00 on a job this size?
Why would I know any of this?
Wasn't all this your job?
I didn't make these things happen.
Somebody else did.
I've tried not to ask who.
- So you don't know?
- What are you saying to me?
A lawyer once told me you can't be convicted of perjury for something you didn't say.
What are you talking about perjury?
What is going on?
I have to tell the truth about what I know.
And so you shall.
And that's it?

"- Hey, Dad."
- You're supposed to be in school.

"And this is my property, so police or no police, you're trespassing."
- Now what do you want?
- A man was killed last night not half a mile from here.
- Where were you?
"- ""Where were you?"""
Don't you be flimflamming with your penny-ante questions.
"You're not interested in where ""I"" was."
Very well.
Where was she?
She was locked up all night and nowhere near your dead man.
(Murdoch):
And why do you keep her caged?
To keep her safe.
It's in her own best interest.
"And charging admission to view her in a cage, is that also in her best interest?"
She's... paying her keep.
"- Mr. Travis, is it?"
- Aye.
You're coming with us to the Station House.
- I have no reason to.
- Do I have to arrest you?
- Come on!
- Don't lay your hands on me.
- (girl grunting)
- I'm doing nothing the law says I can't!
Unlawful confinement of a person or persons.
You're coming with us.
I finished my anatomy report on the unclaimed bank robber.

What kind of place is that?
That is an underground plutonium processing plant.
Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes
"Well, I didn't count on killing anybody."
Especially not us.
It will never go that far.
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming the most powerful man in the world.
"IDs, please."
Take a powder.

Those are the outer security scanners.
Put them out of commission permanently.

"All right, let's run a maintenance check."
"Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right."
- Where to?
"- Andy's place, know it?"
"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.
Second and third?
- Fourth and market.
- That one.
- Hop in.
You got to listen to that shit all day?
You get used to it.
"Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and put you in this air cast."
It's gonna keep everything stabilized until the doctor can examine it.
"Zach, I wasn't trying to hurt you, dude."
"I thought I heard you yell ""all clear."""
"Oh, and this has nothing to do with the fact that I've king to Ashley?"
"I'm sick of your passive aggressive bullshit, Nate."
I'm sorry she likes me more.
We have common interests.
Deal with it.
"Hey, hey, take it easy, buddy."
Don't tell me to take it easy.
I'm seeing clearly for the first time in ages.
My ex-best friend just broke my leg.
I think I might break my own leg if I had to listen to this song all day.
- Right?
"- Take me away now, please."
I've got some thinking to do.
"Yes, sir."
I can't get that goddamn carousel song out of my head.
Torture.
"Yep, that's the one."
"Okay, okay."

♪ Both my friends are sitting right beside me ♪

"T, I would just die if somebody that I cared about was maybe dying and I didn't really have a chance to tell them how much I loved them."
Yeah.
"You know what we got to do, T."
"Starting right now, we got to tell people right in the moment how much they mean to us."
"We got knocked down, but we got right back up."
"You can see that my right arm's gone, yet here I stand tall on my own two feet!"
"The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down."
It's no longer standing.
Why?
"It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside."
But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea.
They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet.
That's right.
It has metal where it counts.
"Think about it, folks."
Metal where it counts.
"You get knocked over, but you'll always get back on your feet ― as long as a man's got two legs to stand on."
"But it's not a man's legs that matter, or his arms, but what he's got in here!"
The Story of Franz Biberkopf

"Good luck, Biberkopf."
"Come on, leave."
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I just can't keep up with this.
"Come on, we'll go and drink some korn."
Even such things are still around.
Where did he go with my suitcase?
I think you got mugged.
They even stole that one.
There is nothing left for me now.
But that doesn't matter.
- At least you can't lose anything.
Haven't seen you in a while.
A beer and two rissoles.
-We need money
"-Off course, Im sorry."
We leave on friday
-Friday?
What about the consert?
"-No, it...."
We were supposed to go together.
"Im going to check if we can pospone it, so that Lise get to go on the consert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, im just beeing stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about the friday?
Do you know anyone that make it be postponed?
"Have it done till tomorrow, Then we pospone until sunday"
-Sorry
-Tronstad?
-Have you got a minut?
"-Yes, what is it about?"
How sure are we?
How far are they with the bomb?
Any new information i have not got?
We're never sure.
We know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr an schetch-
"-That we thought showed a bomb, This was likely an reactor"
"But if you have an reactor you can make plutonium, if you have plutonium you can make a bomb."
"We do not know if heisenberg did it as a warning, help - 69 00:09:57.200 -- 00:09:59.600 - or just to impress"
"Therefor we have to sink the shipment, Cause we just dont know"
"Heisenberg sees heavy water as essential for his research, that we know..."
"The case is, we are afraid."
Somethings wrong with the critical mass
We calculated an ton of uran.
"- Yeah, I was in there yesterday."
- You were in there yesterday?
It's the DEA building.
"Yeah, why were you in there?"
"I was by there, yesterday."
I drove by.
I know the building.
Thanks for this.
Rene says the building we followed the guy into is where the DEA has offices.
"So he's working for them, or working with them, or using their facilities."
"- Somehow, he's connected."
- Looks that way.
- How do you know he's DEA?
"- I don't know, that's the point."
"He was seen going into the DEA building, so he's got a relationship of some kind."
"Come on, you've got to help me out."
"All right, I'll look in to it."
"I had a conversation with Dante, planted the idea of him partnering with Phan's crew."
- He's thinking about it.
- Good.
We have another problem.
"We gotta deal with this DEA agent, or whoever he is, who's looking to kidnap Reardon."
We need Reardon here and able to play.
I don't wanna make that call.
Let me see if I can work some back channels.
"I can poke around, see if the DEA cares about this guy, or what his game is."
It's Julianna.

How did it go?
They're all so nosy.

"I mean, who can talk about themselves for that long?"
"And then at age 12, I decided becoming an actress... would be the best way to serve humanity."
"No, no, no, thank you."
"Oh, Elka."
You are a genius.

"Anyhoo, the evening went so well that, uh, we got up to a little bits of a foolin' around."
Did you French her?
WAYNE:
"Kind of out of line there, Dary."
- Did you go up her shirt?
"- Now you're really out of line, Dary."
"We did French, that much I will reveal."
"Well, you already revealed that much, might as well just tell us if you went up her shirt."
"It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dary."
"I don't like to kiss and tell, but..."
"The Frenchin's tooks a hard left turn, from which I have yets to recover."
Do you wanna know what?
"I'm not asking you to kiss and tell, 'cause that's impolite."
But...
I'm kind of curious.
"Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell."

Ahhhh...
What are you doing?
Practicing karate.
What are you going to do with karate?
My father didn't see the reason of learning anything that didn't get you a job.
"So how's school, Chris?"
"You working on anthropology or paleontology, something complicated, I bet."
My mother thought I was learning all kinds of things 'cause I went to a white school.
"Nope, it's just regular arithmetic."
Y'all hear that?
White kids are working on arithmetic.
"Around here, they're still doing math."
My mother always thought bigger words meant something better.
"Okay, say the blessing, baby."
Where's the meat?
We don't have any.
Didn't you buy some porchops?
"No, that meat was too expensive."
I know we got some canned Spam or some Vienna sausage or bacon...
or beef jerky.
"Some... mean, what kind of meal is that without meat?"
It's a vegetarian meal.
Do I look like a vegetarian to you?
I work 60 hours a week.
I lift papers and boxes all night.

"If we take a look at our past, about 20 or 30 years,"
"Brazil was living an era which it was open and eager for democracy, for free speech, like we have now, and we achieved them, and no one wants to lose it."
I think that is absolutely legitimate.
"But what we need to do now is ethically evolve, and build evolved values, and to me, we still need to begin moving towards that."
"But that's just an example, so what's left for society?"
"I absolutely agree, there was a philosopher who said that example isn't the best way to change character, but the only way to do so."
"And if the example that comes from above is worst, we are already lost."
"I believe in that, and if we take a look at what it takes to change a society, we need to look at other societies, the ones that work, that are evolved and developed."
"They were shaped with good examples, so, we also need to create good examples."

Veja Online magazine published an article which took a look at how people were rooting in social networks for Sarney to die when he had the bacterial infection in his eyelashes.
And the article was saying that it was wrong for people to be rooting for Sarney's death.
"I'm not going to ask you if you rooted for his death, but I will ask you this:"
"There is a Canadian doctor who's taking one of John Lennon's teeth, and he's promising to make a clone out of him."
Are you in favor of making a clone of Sarney?

Welcome to Lecture six of Networks friends money and bytes.
The question we're going to formulate and answer today is why does Wikipedia even work?
Now the word work here is very vague but roughly speaking means that it achieves what it's sets out to do.
"To create a free, open, online interactive encyclopedia."
And there are many reasons why it should not have worked.
We're going to take a look at the challenges it faced and then zoom into a specific item of consensus formation.
"But before that, let's do a, a very quick recap of what we have been in the space of Work 2.0."
"We talked about Google's page rank, which turns a graph of webpage connection, into a single rank order list, according to the importance scores."
"Then, we talked about Netflix recommendation,"
"Which turns a user movie rating matrix into many ranked orderless, one for each user."
Then we talked about average rating on
"Amazon, or more generally speaking rating aggregation."
That turns a vector of rating scores for each product into a single scaler.
And then use that to generate a ranking for different products.
"The last lecture, or this lecture, we will be talking about voting systems that turns a set of rank ordered lists, many of them, into a single rank order list."
In terms of ambiguity of the problem statement.
Or perhaps this is in ascending order.
Looks like all four of them are very heavily used in both online space in our other aspects of daily lives.
"Now to Wikipedia, which was launched a little over a decade ago in 2001."
And is a result of three movements.
One is wikis as a template for online collaboration.
The other is free and open software movement.
And the third is the emergence of online encyclopedia.
Wikipedia is free.
"Really, it's not that I can't remember that moment. or that I don't want to speak poorly of anyone."
"One thing I do remember was calling two journalists who had been assaulted that night, and I couldn't believe what was happening."
"I said ""this is senseless""."
And I thought if it happened to me I couldn't put up with the idea of people thinking that I'd had it coming.
"You know, thinking ""he must have done something wrong""."
"I thought if it had happened to me, I'd have to do a lot of explaining about what I was doing at that moment."
"And it's a fracture, because you know people, two people who"
"I spoke to that night, and they're anything but violent [laughter]."
Anything but violent!
ST:
Violence is never a good thing.
"For me it was a kind of emotional ""deflowering""."
"I didn't know these things could happen in this country, I couldn't believe it."
"But when the press was assaulted, it was like crossing a border."
Like giving a signal.
I was really moved when I heard that story.
JL:
"I was really moved when I read you, because you explained yourself so well and although bad things happen, there are things that can't happen."
"Although that day there were a lot of things that could be criticised, though I wasn't there,"
I've read a lot of people who I trust from within the 15M movement who did things that normally aren't coherent with the 15M demonstrations.
But that's one thing and what you talked about regarding real atrocities.
"Police abuse that were later well documented, so nobody can deny it."
That also appeared in the mainstream media
"Suddenly the mainstream media were considering as true certain aspects of the police abuse that they would normally be very skeptical of, if there hadn't been documents and proof, thanks to the net, the new technologies, etc."
"Or even myself, I don't think I'm anti anything, but if I didn't know the people who were there and if I hadn't seen the videos maybe I'd have thought there had been agitators within the group."
So I don't shout out to the world that I'm a great defender of freedom for the people in the street.
"I'm saying that if it hadn't been for the internet, a lot of people, who normally got their information from normal sources, would have said ""they must have had it coming""."
And yet you talk to someone you know and you ask yourself how it could happen.
Something breaks.
You stop trusting.
"That night I thought, it's a bitter sensation,"
I thought they'd turned these two friends of mine into two anti-system people.

This is an introduction to what we'll be doing in Week one in Physics twelve.
"Basically, we'll be looking at the characteristics of science."
This includes that science is divided into topics.
This you'll mostly read about in the textbook.
We'll also talk about how to be human activity.
"Again, this is mostly in the textbook."
"We will talk about the science of philosophy, this will show up in the"
"lectures but if you want to review the sections, these are all in chapter one."
The fact that it's practiced by a community. the institutional aspects.
"These are going to come a bit more later in the course, but I'll review briefly in the textbook."
"The fact that there is a specific method or process, we'll start that this week in the lectures but that will be the focus in the next two weeks."
"And the fact that it's constrained, this will be a key element of what is done in discussion this week."
"Or if this is a purely online version of course, we would be doing that in the forums."
"The philosophy of science, something that we will start looking at this week contains a few key parts."
The first being that the
laws of the universe are discoverable.
The universe is noble.
"The second is that science is repeatable, this is a key part in the online lectures but is covered in the book."
The laws are uniform and invariant.
"The laws are simple, and the"
laws are objective.
"These are ideas you definitely want to start becoming familiar with this week, but we will keep coming back to over the next couple of weeks."
The three things that set the groundwork is the scientific process.
"And those would be the scientific method, which is the advanced version of what you learned, probably in grade school."
This is how the individual scientist does his work.
Programs can block.
It's not sensitive to blockage the way that event loops are.
"In fact, it loves to block."
The whole reason they have threads is so that they can block.
"Execution will continue as long as any thread is not blocked, and if you have multiple cores and if they're not blocking each other, they can all go forward and that's a good thing."
Maybe your program will go faster if you're lucky.
There are some cons.
One is that you need to allocate stack memory per thread.
"That was once a big deal; it's not a big deal now, memory's so cheap and abundant."
"A real concern, though, is if two threads are using the same memory, a race may occur, which is even worse than saying a race will occur."
I'll show you what I mean by that in a moment.
"There are more cons, but before we do that..."
"For years, people have been saying 'why can't we have threads in JavaScript?', so let me show you what happens when you have threads in JavaScript."
"Here we've got two one line programs which are each going to run as a thread, both at the same time, and they are both sharing access to my_array."
Each is going to append one element to my_array.
There are several possible outcomes of this.
One of them is that we get an array containing a and b.
Another is that we get an array containing b and a.
"This is not the race I'm talking about, although you do have this non-determinism, and that's considered good."
Let me show you what's considered bad.
"One possible outcome is we get just a or just b, even though both successfully completed their rights."
How is that possible?
Anybody have a question as to how this went wrong?
Let me show you what went wrong.
One way you can look at appending something to an array is to break it down into several more primitive instructions.
"When you do that first statement, you're doing the equivalent of the last four statements."
Everybody see how that works?
OK.
"Now, when you have threads, they're both doing similar stuff and they can shuffle the order of the execution of the stuff in any way that they want."
"They might do it always the same way, or they might occasionally do it a different way."
The way they'll usually do it is they'll work fine when you do it in development and do it in a really bad way when you're in production.
[laughter]
Susan Calvin develops the positronic brain.
She designs their three laws and their implementation.
She is very important.
She is also unattached to any mails.
"Interesting, she's a wise old woman, she's not in any way part of the Eden complex."
She's much more like the female god.
"At the end, in the evitable conflict, she confronts Steven Bierley in his office."
"And she acknowledges that the whole world wonders whether or not he, who seems to be keeping everything running so well, whether or not he is not himself a robot."
"I mean, how can you distinguish perfect robots from human beings?"
"Earlier in the novel, Susan Calvin had said the only difference between a robot and a human being is that robots are essentially decent."
"Well, Stephen Bierley doesn't answer her."
"He doesn't prove his humanity, and he doesn't prove his robot nature."
"He doesn't admit to anything he says in fact, which either a robot or a human would say, humans would not like to know that a mere man controlled everything."
"And humans would not like to know that a robot, a mere machine had taken over the government of the human population."
"And so it is better for human beings not to know whether I, Steven Barley, I am human or a robot."
We can't argue with that logic.
The last image of the story is a fireplace behind a quartz fire screen and we look in it and a flame goes out and a wisp of smoke rises.
When I first read that I thought well the whole book seemed to be working its way toward utopia.
But I know what it means for a flame to be extinguished.
"Hey when a flame goes out, you know, that's the end of insight."
That's the advent of darkness.
"This is, this is negative."
The robots have taken us over.
But it didn't fit with the rest of the book.
"Well if you read the book as a series of separate stories that just happened to be published together as an anthology, what difference does it make?"
So one of the stories doesn't actually fit thematically with the others.
"But if you read it as a composite novel, How do you make sense of that smoke?"
"So, one day I was speaking to a colleague of mine, a quite prominent our historian and as soon as she heard this she said that's the Merode Altarpiece."
The Merode alter piece?
The Merode Altarpiece is a key example of a medieval iconographic trick.
"When in the annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will bear the child of God."
"The Devine Light goes across from Gabriel as God's messenger to Mary striking sometimes in some paintings into her head, sometimes into her womb."
Last Probe for HuK!
"Three hit points left on this Stalker, it is trying to get around to the smoke."
"The Zealot is coming around, to try and swing it."
"Going into the smoke, the Zealot, will it kill the Stalker?"
"It is regenerating a lot of shields, now up to 20 shields is the Stalker, and NaNiwa might have done the impossible!"
"- His shields are coming back, that's exactly what he needed."
"The Probe are trying to get a surround, the Zealots are getting some shots off, down to 13 shields."
"NaNiwa, be careful, please!"
He needs those shields to come back.
"HuK trying to track down that Stalker, it is going to come down to micro here, trying to trap him."
One miss click and one of these players will lose the game.
And the Probe going for the kill.
"Down to eight shields and three HP, this is absolutely the most insane game I have ever seen."
Insane micro from both of these two players.
"The Stalker running around, trying to stay alive, trying to micro the best he can."
"HuK is hilariously trying to mine with the one Probe he has, trying to get more units on the field."
"But, this is an insane game Kibbles."
"- Axel, what has happened here?"
"While all of this is occurring, HuK is currently taking, he has taken out the Nexus with a Zealot, and NaNiwa has no chance of having an economic recovery."
This Stalker is his last hope to victory.
All the buildings could eventually be killed here by the Zealot in the main base.
NaNiwa has a clock ticking.
But he is managing to maybe kill one of these Zealots here.
"HuK, ultimately may end up needing to bring the Zealot from home."
This type of situation is called a dominant strategy in that confess is a dominant strategy for player 2 meaning it's always the best regardless of what the other guy does.
"Think about this the other way around, say we make some guesses as to what player 2 is going to do and then when we say in each case what's player 1's best response in that situation."
"So if player 2 confesses, what's the best thing for player 1 to do?"
"Say if player 2 confesses we're over here on the right somewhere we say player 1 can either get 5 by confessing or 0 for being quiet this problem is looking strangely familiar, say well 5 is better than 0 so player 1 is going to want to confess."
Now if player 2 doesn't confess what should player 1 do?
"So if player 2 doesn't confess, we're over here on the left somewhere and player 1 can either get 10 by being quiet or 15 by ratting out his buddy, well 15 is greater than 10 so he's going to want to confess."
Notice here that because we confessed in both cases confessing is also a dominant strategy for player 1.
So here I've circled player 2's best responses in green and I've circled player 1's best responses in blue and you'll notice there's one place here where they over lap to say that in this situation where both parties confess both of them are responding as best they can to what they think the other person is going to be doing.
We have to follow the European
laws in Europe.
We have to follow the Chinese laws.
"We decided in China we did not like the way in which their censorship was working, so we moved to the other China, which was"
Hong Kong.
So we'll see what happens.
So we make that decision on a per country basis.
My own view is that these changes are happening so quickly.
The societies are not really prepared for what's going to happen when everybody is online.
Everybody is posting information about what's going on around them.
"I also think that in general this is very good because it empowers citizens, and citizens are fundamentally good."
"Citizens fundamentally want to make their countries a better place, and so I would say that in a positive context."
But I think that countries are a classic example where the laws conflict.
There are obviously also corporations that have different models from us that we also compete with.
"I see there are some questions over there as well, don't forget them."
"Yes, sir? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KAVlTSKl:"
Kavitski from Online Magazine in Germany.
I have two questions.
"One that is a specific one, Google translate, is that something you write, you also doing in a phone call over the air?"
"And the second, more general question about Chrome OS which, in my opinion, is almost like the big Android, for example, very suitable for tablets, is that coming soon or can you give us a short update there? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"So, two separate questions that the live translate is the next logical succession to the demo that you saw and you could imagine eventually it might be possible."
"Right now, we can do it the way you saw it."
So we're pretty close.
And I think eventually it'll be possible to speak.
"Today, you can SMS somebody and without speaking the language and I think it's reasonable to expect that with some level of accuracy you'll be able to do it live over time."
"Again, as the technology gets better, and remember these algorithms are trained algorithms."
"As they get more data, they get better."
"So a classic example where the computer does something better because the humans help it and the humans do something better because the computer is there, they can actually communicate with each other."
"On the question about Chrome OS, Chrome OS has been announced."
Chrome OS is an operating system which is in early availability and it's targeted primarily at the Netbook space today.
"And of course, because it's free, it's open-source."
People will also use it for tablets.
You know your position down.
"So, do your friends, right?"
This could be use in all sorts of very powerful ways.
"Your car, right?"
Your car should be able to drive itself.
"After all, the car knows where it is, knows where the other cars are, knows where you're going, right?"
"You can monitor in case it has a bug in it, right?"
"But aside from that, the car should take you where you want to go."
"This explosion of real-time telemetry, which is a fantastic explosion on information measured in what are called terabytes and petabytes of information, is the defining computer science data challenge."
And what's interesting about products like
"Google Maps, you saw some of this in our demo, and Google Earth is that people who love the earth--and I hope it's all of us--can love it even more."
"We can know even more about what's going on in our planet, by the way, our only planet that we care so deeply about and want to make sure it's in good shape."
You really do have all the world's information at your fingertips in any language.
There are more than 160 million uses of translate every day.
"That number is, again, growing very, very quickly."
People actually don't all speak English.
"It's always a shock to Americans, sorry."
Germans understand this very well.
It's amazing how much information there is in languages that you don't speak.
"It's true for all of us, and especially for English speakers."
We will know and we can help you figure out what to pay attention to right now.
"The explosion in user content, the explosion in real-time data, what am I thinking, what am I doing, social networks and so forth, we can help you sort that out."
We can help you figure out what is most relevant to you right now.
"Now, it's interesting, you're never lonely because your friends are always nearby, we always know where they are, they're always near you, they're always connected to you, at least in cyberspace."
"Your friends make Google in the web more powerful, they augment it, they make it special, and you're never bored, right?"
"Instead of wasting a lot of time watching television, you can waste time watching the Internet, right?"
And we have a lot more choices for you to waste your time with.
"So, not only you're never lonely, you're never bored."
"And occasionally, you might learn something in the process of being entertained, so whether it's games or movies or videos, and in the Leanback experience, we actually suggest what you should be watching because we know what you care about."
So you don't need to worry so much about what your--what are the choices.
We figure it out for you.
We're never out of ideas.
"So, they can be described by four numbers, three spatial coordinates and a time coordinate."
They can be anything.
"You know, turning on a light, doing anything you want to do."
"Receiving a photon, whatever it is."
But they are points in a four-dimensional space-time and therefore require four numbers to describe them.
"And you can only get from one to another if they're separated from a time-like, that is to say, a negative, interval."
"Okay, so this expression, which I'll write down again, this is called a metric."
And the particular metric that I've written down here is the metric for flat space.
"Because remember, this is special relativity."
"There's no masses, no curvature of space, none of that stuff, yet."
This is the metric for flat space with no mass present.
And there are many other metrics possible.
"Any time you add mass or do other things, you get different kinds of metrics more complicated than this."
"So, what's special about special relativity is that you use the metric appropriate for flat space as opposed to the many other different kinds of metrics that you can use in general relativity, which has a much more general form for the metric."
"I should say, you can also write this down."
You can write down the spatial terms here in polar coordinates.
Remember polar coordinates?
"Polar coordinates, you describe the position in space, instead of with x, y, Z, you describe it with a radius, a distance from zero, and some angles."
"And it turns out, that's convenient to do so."
"Let me write this down in polar coordinates, or in polar."
That's an r.
Let me write that explicitly.
"This is an Omega, that's some angle."
And then the T thing remains the same.
And I've pulled a little bit of a notational fast one on you here.
I've gone away from the deltas and I've written these down as d.
This is the differential d.
Those of you who have taken some calculus will remember this.
"If this were a calculus-based course I would explain why I did that, but I'm not going to."
"So, just allow me this slight of hand, here."
"For technical reasons, these have to be differential."
Yes?
"I'm sorry, you want to choose something that's 5500K or higher in terms of the color temperature."
"You want to go below 5500K, 5500K is about daylight, so it's just the minimum part of daylight."
"The ones that I have I believe are 6,000K, 85 watt, 4800 lumens."
"Ok, so you can see the setup basically, it's a very simple setup."
You have the two lights that are on either side side of the screen which illuminate the background.
"Now, what I am going to do is switch around so you can see what I am looking at as I am facing the camera."
"Ok, here is my setup so what I am doing when I am reading from the screen, when"
"I am doing a professional video and looking at the camera, this is what I see."
It's in my kitchen my little dining area.
"Basically, it's a real quick setup."
"You have two lights, I am sorry, two lights on either side, so a total of four lights."
"Those are usually called the ""key lights,"" and they illuminate me as I am doing my videos."
"Now, if you zoom up, or if I zoom up I should say and focus there a little bit, you can see that they're clip-on lights."
"They are the shop lights, eight inch shop lights."
"Inside those the bulbs are actually lower wattage, they can be 26 watt cfls"
"Now, you want to choose ones that have a warmer appearance, so you are talking about warmer bulbs, you don't want to get the daylight."
"You want to get 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures."
"The ones that do the screen that illuminate the screen, those are daylight."
"These you want to warm, you want to have more of a warm appearance to whoever is on camera, and those are 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures"
"Next you see, now normally, that right there, you can see the iPad that is sitting there."
"Normally, the iPad, there's a camera, and the camera I am holding right now."
"The camera is there which I'll go over in a second, and then you have the iPad."
Of course an iPad is expensive.
"You can get a Droid tablet, that's fine."
"You can also rig up something depending on how it is, rig up something so that you could put a table, and then use a laptop as your teleprompter if you even wanted to do a teleprompter so now let's talk about the camera."
"In fact,"
let me go ahead and get my cell phone camera to talk about the camera.
"Ok, so I gave you a little tour."
"A real quick recap as you have the screen, I use a white projection screen."
"You have the two screen lights on either side, very high lumen bulbs to wash out the white background, so it's over-exposed."
"Next, I have on either side of me I have the key lights which are on each side, I have two"
"lower wattage, I think it said 26 watt bulbs, and again, held within the shop lights."
"Because with purchasing you just, it is kind of like renting or leasing a house, you are kind of borrowing that car for three years and you pay lease and with that lease you can use it so many miles a year and if you go over that it costs you more."
"You do have to pay some money up front but, some different options."
And I want you to look at the different options.
"On page 197, here is Check Out A Used Car."
And it gives you some suggestions on some things that you will want to look at before you decide to purchase a used car.
"On top of page 198, Figuring It Out."
This explains how to determine whether you should buy versus leasing an automobile.
And it shows you how to get the total cost to buy and how to get the total cost to lease.
And I am calling that to your attention because you are going to do one of those in your assignments for today.
"So, it is extremely important that you know that what is on the top of page 198 will give you the information to enable you to do that problem today."
I love that your book gives you information on bargaining.
Throughout this course one of the things I have told you is that my husband and I because we take cash in when we buy a car we have a lot of bargaining power.
"I mean when you say I am willing to write you a check right now today for $8,000 so I will give you my car and I will trade it for that one for $8,000."
"And what I tell them is that it is $8,000 total."
"That includes the taxes, the title, all your little bitty fees you add on."
I am not doing any of that.
"I am giving you my car and $8,000."
Are you willing to do that?
"And you know when you lay it out there in black and white, ha."
And you can do that.
I mean first you can let them...
I will tell you what they try to do that really drives me crazy is instead of talking price of the car they want to talk monthly payment.
"Guys don't fall into that trap. $100 a month, and usually it is $400 a month or $300 a month for six years, is a lot of money!"
Figure out what that car is costing you!
"You know, if you are going on 60 months and I think come people don't realize 60 months is five years!"
"So, if for the next five years you are going to be paying $300 a month and I am trying to just do this in my head, but you are paying $300 a month times 60."
"You know, what is that car going to eventually cost you?"
"And I know right now interest rates are very low, but are you going to be satisfied with a car over five years."
"Because, what tends to happen with a lot of people when they finance for a long period of time"
like that is then when they get ready to trade their car in it is not worth what they owe for it.
So they are what we call upside down.
"And we talked about upside down in another chapter earlier in the book, but that means you owe more than it is worth."
"So, when you trade it in they actually instead of you getting money for that car, you owe more for the new car you are buying and if you keep doing that eventually you will be really, really upside down."
"So really, really watch that."
It is better if you do finance it to finance it for two years or three years because you are probably going to keep it and at the end of that two or three years it is probably going to be worth more than what you owe on it if you decide to trade it in.
"We pay cash, so, I don't know a lot about that."
"But also, if you do that at the end of those three years you are going to have your car paid off instead of never getting a car paid off."
Okay?
And I know when we were younger we couldn't do that.
We couldn't pay cash for a car.
We had to go in you know and finance a car.
"But, we never financed it for five or six years like they are allowing you to do now."
Let's go on and look at page 200.
I want to really call your attention to this because you are going to use this on a project that you are going to do at the end of the semester for me.
"But, if you look on page 200, Automobile Operation Costs."
"That is something you have to consider and along with the information they have there, I want you to understand gas costs."
It is the annual mileage divided by the miles per gallon times the average cost of gasoline.
"So, you have to take, this is how much I drive this car annually and then I divide it by how many miles per gallon it gets and then I take that and multiply it times the average gas rate for that year."
And then that will tell you about how much money you are spending for gas cost.
"The cost per mile, take that total cost and divide by the number of miles that you have driven the car that year."
Okay?
It talks about maintenance.
You have to take that into consideration when you are thinking about how much a car costs.
"And then the next thing that your book goes into talking about, Resolving Consumer Complaints."
And I want you to read this.
There is a lot of information in here.
So many people just
let people run all over them and you shouldn't do that.
You have rights as a consumer.
And this chapter talks about those rights all the way up to the point of finally just taking some legal action.
And I know we live in a society of everyone sues everyone.
You know when you spill a cup of coffee and you sue the people who give it to you as if you didn't know that the cup of coffee was going to be hot!
Well then there is a problem.
Now it is one thing if someone from that business spills the coffee on you.
"Both say in unison, ""I certainly do."""
"Marriage is the same from here to Peru, Here, some examples of what it will construe:"
"Megan, baby Bayley when he gets the flu, Sure to feed baby Bayley hot chicken stew,"
"And top notch was his beer home brew, And no you don't smell his smelly old shoe."
"Bayley don't demonstrate your clumsy kung foo,"
Take Megan out when she wants fondoo.
"Here's your biggest marriage advice clue,"
Don't you dare speak of her taboo tattoo!
"And let NO ONE speak of a love that's untrue, From humble beginnings, all of this grew."
"Megan and Bayley, almost time for adieu, Honeymoon awaits, have fun when you scream down the highway at a high rate of speed on the way to your destination."
"All seriousness, you two are a great couple."
"Bayley, you are truly the best man here and"
"Megan, you could not have chosen anybody better to spend the rest of your life with."
Congrats to both of you.
"The answer for the first one is 0.125--that is the half times the half times the half, makes an 8th."
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M* is equal to the probability the message is M* divided by the K.
We've shown these two things.
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.
"We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B, which is 1 over K."
"The ""over Ks"" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability that the message is equal to M*."
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.
You might think the class should be over.
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.
We're not going quite done yet.
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.
One problem is that it's malleable.
"What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob, and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped, it's an eavesdropper with a hammer."
"If our interceptor has control over the network, and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker."
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.
Thought it would be useful to have a problem session.
Let's see if we can work the following problem.
"So our problem says, suppose we have a source, right here."
"And just one millimeter away, we have a sink, right there."
"What is the potential that results, form this source and sink?"
"At this point up here, A."
And what is the potential that results from this source and sink at this point b.
"If you notice this diagram is not to scale, it gives you the idea that the separation along the x axis between the source and sink is small only one unit."
And both the source and sync are a long ways a way from either field point a or field point b because field point a and b are ten units away on the z axis.
"So if we take these segments, in turn we can say look this problem is done readily enough but the fact that we have a equation that gives us the potential to a source and sink combination, We compute 5p as I0 over four pi sigma R etc."
And if we specialize that to our particular situation we'd say that means that pi over A is equal to I zero over four pi sigma.
"One over R, minus one over R prime."
"If we go over to our diagram and we say, how much is r and how much is r prime?"
"Well, r is the distance to the source."
"R is the distance from field point a, where we're computing the potential, to the source."
That's distance r.
R prime is the distance from the field point A to the sink.
"Now if you look at these, this problem you would say hm."
R and R prime are just about the same.
Cuz A is a long way from the source and a
long way from the sank.
"So surely the answer here is zero, or if not zero, inconsequential."
"It seems like that would be the case, but it's just not true."
"The difference between R and R-prime may be small, but there is a difference."
"And because there's a difference, this term, one over R, minus one over R-prime is definitely not equal to zero."
"I'll write that up here, too, just for emphasis."
That term is not equal to zero.
"And as a result, when you compute phi A."
"It will have, a definite number value."
I'll leave it up to you to complete the calculation.
"If we now move on and look at the second part, the b part of the, of the problem session question, it's the same question, except it just asks for a different field point."
Now we're asking for b rather than a.
"In it's a particular kind of hashing, called modular hashing."
It's just a particular way of computing a hash function.
"It's easiest to think about in terms of numbers, although it, it works in all kinds of situations."
"Because remember everything in a computer is encoded as a byte, which can be treated as bytes which could be treated as binary numbers."
And so what we are going to do is in this case We saw a pattern characters are decimal digits.
"And so, we'll treat a sequence of pattern characters as the decimal number."
"And modular hashing is, just take a big prime."
And compute the remainder when you divide your number by that prime.
"So in this case, 613 is the remainder that you get when you divide 26,535 by 997."
So you can check that.
So that's what we're going to use as the hash function.
And that.
This type of hashing is widely used.
"You have a prime number, we talked about it when we talked about hashing."
"It satisfies, it seems to satisfy something like the uniform hash assumption under various circumstances."
"So that's our pattern, a five character pattern, and we're going to keep the small hash values 613 and this is going to generalize to longer patterns, and we'll talk about that in a minute."
"So now, suppose we have this text."
And our pattern happens to occur here in the text.
And what the method is built on is the idea of you take the first five characters in the text and compute its hash value.
"In this case, 31,415, mod down 97, is 508."
So that's different so that's not the pattern.
"Maybe take the next five characters, that's 201."
That's diffent It's not the pattern.
Take the next one.
"That's 715, different it's not the pattern 15,926 by 97 is 971, it's not the pattern."
"Eventually, when you have the text characters that are the same as the pattern characters you're gonna get the same result, it's a match."
"If the pattern hat, hash equals the text sub-string hash you, you have the potential for a match."
And that's what the algorithm is based on.
"Now it seems like, we're doing a lot of calculation, with, making numbers out of these things."
"And, and keep doing modular arithmetic on it."
"But actually there's, a really, simple way to, severely limit the amount of calculation."
"And give a quick linear algorithm for, search."

No more austerity!
That was the demand from unions in Brussels a day before EU leaders are due to gather in the city for a summit which will be crowned with a new fiscal treaty.
"The pact's aim is to control deficits in the bloc, but as in other parts of Europe which also saw protest action, demonstrators called for a new strategy."
"""Come up with another policy, your policy of austerity isn't working and is creating a gulf between citizens and you the leaders of Europe."" said one protester."
"""Greece is in the red."
"But Swiss banks hold Greek assets which are worth three times more than that country's public debt, so there is a way of finding the money without workers having to pay,"" said another women at the rally which was held in front of the EU Commission."
"Reporting from the protest euronews"" Gülsüm Alan said:"
"""As anti-austerity rallies take place across Europe, EU leaders are getting ready to sign on new fiscal treaty here in Brussels this Friday."
"Instead of solving the bloc's problems Unions believe it will only plunge Europe into a deeper recession."""
", The Chain rule is so important, it's worth thinking through a proof of its validity."
Let us see the words of the Tiferet Israel who is one of the commentators of the Mishnah.He writes as follows.
"""Man is compared to a tree in the bible and his wisdom is his honor"
"like the honor the branches are to a tree."""
"Wisdom is beauty just like the branches beautify the tree. ""the observance of the Mitzvot of the Torah is like the roots of the tree.The Mitzvot themselves  are the roots,when a person fulfills them.Look how contrary this is to the way people think."
"""Though,when he becomes too knowledgable.."""
"Like a person who studies a lot in the Kabbalah centers they have today,where he studies and studies but doesn't observe anything practical."
"So he says when he becomes too knowledgable,""He is like a tree that used up all his energy for its branches thereby making its energy too dull for its roots."
"Meaning,the investment itself turns out to be a deficiency."
"It is known that in nature,every tree whose strength spreads  to the very top doesn't have enough strength for the bottom."
"And the two of them,meaning the one who has many branches on top and the one who has few roots below,will uproot more easily."
Same goes for a man like this.
"""By the branching out of his wisdom of God's hidden laws"
"He learns and learns,the hidden aspects of the Torah,Kabbalah etc."
"So will the roots of his heavenly fear be lessened and weakened in his heart."""
Why?Because he doesn't apply or fulfill.
And they will both be the reason for his fall.When the wind of heresy captures him at the end it will completely uproot him from his eternal area of success.
"Meaning,you may see a person"
like this whose wisdom specifically will bury him at the end and uproot him.
Therefore it is so important to know that alongside the wisdom that a person acquires he must also apply the Mitzvot and fulfill them in everyday life.
We will conclude with one more special thing that we learn from the world of vegetation.
That is the topic of the  resurrection of the dead.
"There are many who wonder how a person who passed away and was buried,will once again be resurrected."
It sounds illogical.But a person who stands before God and asks
"Him,Tell me,God,will you really resurrect the dead in the future?"
"We've buried a person,how can he rise?"
What does God answer him?
"He says,are you surprised that I will do that?"
I do it already.
I do it in the world of vegetation.
How can a seed grow?
"You take the seed plant it in the ground,cover it and water it."
"It goes through a certain process  and suddenly from within this process where just a minute ago the seed  looked like something you could grind and make flour or bread from and now it looks bad.But from this bad looking seed,a stem comes out with a few dozen grains at its head."

GlRL:
You know how frustrating it is trying to help your kids when they're sick.
I don't feel so good.
GlRL:
A visit to the doctor's office can be a challenge.
[ Blows nose ]
"No, I don't want you to take my temperature."
No!
I wish it would feel better -- my ear.
GlRL:
"Snort, sniffle, sneeze -- no antibiotics, please!"
"As a parent, you want to help make your child feel better as fast as possible."
It's tempting to think that antibiotics are the answer when your child is sick.
But that may not always be the case.
You don't look so good.
"A lot of illnesses can be caused by viruses, and antibiotics don't work on viruses."
"In fact, antibiotics are strong medicines that can have serious side effects."
DR. WHlTNEY:
"I'm a doctor, but also the mother of two kids."
So I have order n operations at each level in the tree.
And then how many levels deep am I?
"Well, that's the divide, right?"
So how many levels do I have?
"Log n, because at each stage I'm cutting the problem in half."
So I start off with n then it's n over two n over four n over eight.
"So I have n operations log n times, there we go, n log n."
"Took us a long time to get there, but it's a nice algorithm to have."
Let me generalize this slightly.
"When we get a problem, a standard tool to try and attack it with is to say, is there some way to break this problem down into simpler, I shouldn't say simpler, smaller versions of the same problem."
"If I can do that, it's a good candidate for divide and conquer."
And then the things I have to ask is how much of a division do I want to do?
"The obvious one is to divide it in half, but there may be cases where there are different divisions you want to have take place."
The second question I want to ask is what's the base case?
When do I get down to a problem that's small enough that it's basically trivial to solve?
Here it was lists of size one.
I could have stopped at lists of size two right.
That's an easy comparison.
"Do one comparison and return one of two possible orders on it, but I need to decide that."
And the third thing I need to decide is how do I combine?
"You know, point out to you in the binary search case, combination was trivial."
The answer to the final search was just the answer all the way up.
"Here, a little more work, and that's why I'll come back to that idea."
"If I'm basically just squeezing jello, that is, I'm trying to make the problem simpler, but the combination turns out to be really complex, I've not gained anything."
"So things that are good candidates for divide and conquer are problems where it's easy to figure out how to divide down, and the combination is of"
little complexity.
"It would be nice if it was less than linear, but linear is nice because then I'm going to get that n log in kind of behavior."
"And if you ask the TAs in recitation tomorrow, they'll tell you that you see a lot of n log n algorithms in computer science."
"It's a very common class of algorithms, and it's very useful one to have."
"Now, one of the questions we could still ask is, right, we've got binary search, which has got this nice log behavior."
"If we can sort things, you know, we get this n log n behavior, and we got a n log n behavior overall."
But can we actually do better in terms of searching.
"Cassatt has so much in common with her impressionist colleagues and is really picking up on some of the most advanced problems that they were confronting in their art, an interest in artificial light, for example."
The informality of loose brushwork of an attempt to capture a moment in time.
These are all concerns that were important to her impressionist colleagues.
Steven:
One of the areas that I found most interesting is the place where her shoulders meet.
"The representation of her shoulders and the representation of the reflection of her shoulders, and all of that comes together just at the top of the upholstered chair that she sits on, and if you work out from that point, the arc of the balcony that we see reflected in the mirror becomes a reference to her vision, as she looks out at the audience, even as it looks back to her."

Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night
We've been together
"Lovers at first sight, in love forever"
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
[Instrumental]
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever

"Finally, another definition that's important is marginal cost, which is the change in cost with a change in output."
"So the marginal cost is just like-- remember, we want to think in terms of marginal decision making in this course."
"So the marginal cost is the change in cost with the change in-- actually, that should be a little q."
The change in a firm's cost with the change in the firm's output is marginal cost.
"And then finally, average cost is just what it sounds like."
"Average cost is just c over q, it's just the average."
"So the difference between marginal and average cost, is basically average costs is the average over the whole set of goods produced."
Marginal cost is the cost of that next unit of production.
So those are our key definitions.
"Now with those in mind, let's ask how do we get costs?"
And the answer is we get them from the production function.
"Once we do a production function, we can derive costs."
"So if we have some production function, q equals f of I and k, then we can say the cost of producing q is equal to f of wl plus rk."
"Where w is the wage rate, or the rate you pay per unit of"
"labor, and r is the rental rate, or the rate you pay per unit of capital."
"Now, let me just pause here for a second to talk about pricing capital."
"It's easy to think the cost of an hour of labor, it's the wage you pay for an hour."
It's harder to think about the cost of a unit of capital.
"Because we buy the machines, right?"
So how do we think about the cost?
"I'm going to cover this later in the course, for now imagine all machines are rented."
Imagine you rent every machine you use.
And think of r as the rental price of that unit of capital.
"So with buildings it make sense, firms often rent the buildings they're in."
"Think of r as the rental price of that unit of building, or that unit of machine."
We'll come back later to see why that's a sensible way to think about it.
"The key point is, the reason we have to do this is the wage is a flow measure, every hour I pay you a new wage."
"If I use the cost of buying the machine, that be a stock measure, so you couldn't really compare it to wages."
So we want to use a flow measure.
The flow measures is what we have to pay every period to rent the machine.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
And that separation is 0.088 millimeter.
"If we make the openings much narrower, indeed, the light intensities would be more uniform, each maximum would be approximately the same strength, but then very little light will go through."
And so it's a trade-off.
"And the moment you make these two openings, these two slots,"
"larger and larger, you will understand Friday why then the light intensities are not the same, why the light intensity is a maximum at the center and then falls off near the edge."
As you see.
"It's a maximum here, and then the light intensities become smaller."
"I've shown you now the interference pattern with sound and for red laser light, but imagine now that I did the same with white light."
"The situation would be very different, and maybe even disappointing for you."
Let this be the location on the screen.
"So we -- we have X here, and here X is 0."
"And I want to know where the maxima are in the red, well that's very easy, there will be a maximum here when this position is L times lambda divided by D."
This is when Nancy is 1.
And there will also be a maximum here when we have 2L times lambda divided by D.
"And of course there will be one on this side, same distance."
"And there will be one here, this is when N is 0."
N is 1.
N is 2.
The red light will have maxima.
How about the blue light?
"The blue light will have maxima here, where L lambda divided by D, but lambda is different,"
lambda for blue light is smaller.
"Substantially smaller than red light, so the maximum of the blue will fall here, the maximum of the blue will always fall at N equals 0 together with red, and then Nancy equals 2 the blue will fall here, so this is Nancy 2, Nancy 1, Nancy 0."
"And here Nancy 0, Nancy 1, Nancy 2."
And so the red and the blue and therefore all the other colors
live a life of their own.
They don't talk to each other.
They come in with their own separation in terms of angles and in terms of locations X. That's the reason why I chose one and only one frequency with the sound.
"Because if I had exposed you to many different frequencies, many different wavelengths, then the location of silence for one wavelength is not the location of silence for the other wavelength."
And so the experiment would not have worked.
"And that's why it worked so well with the laser, the red laser, which is practically one wavelength, and so the minima and the maxima are extremely well-defined."
"If we had done the experiment with white light, it wouldn't have been so impressive, and on the next slide I show you what you w- would have seen then."

"What we're doing in this video is study a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, that was first discovered,as far as we know by James Garfield in 1876."
What's exciting about this is that he was not a professional mathematician.
You might know James Garfield as the twentieth president of the United States.
"He was elected president in 1880, and then he became president in 1881."
And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.
What's exciting about that is is it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician or the only US president who was into geometry.
And what Garfield realised is that we can construct a right triangle-
"Let's say this side over here is length 'b'(blue) and this side is length 'a'(red), and let's say this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length 'c'."
And let me make it clear -- it is a right triangle.
He essentially flipped and rotated this triangle to construct another one that is congruent to the first one.
So let me construct that.
So we're going to have length 'b.'
"And it's colinear with length 'a', It's along the same line as length 'a.'"
They don't overlap with each other.
So this is a side of length 'b.'
And then you have your side of length 'a' at a right angle.
And then you have your side of length 'c.'
"So the first thing we need to think about is, &amp;amp;quot;What's the angle between these two sides?&amp;amp;quot;"
What's this mystery angle going to be?
"Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove to ourselves it really is what we think it looks like."
"If we look at this original triangle, and we call this angle 'theta,' what's this angle over here, the angle that's between the sides of length a and c. what's the measure of this angle going to be?"
"Well, theta plus this angle has to add up to 90, because when you add those two together, they add up to the 90."
So 90 and 90 you get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle.
"So if these two angles together is 90, then this angle is '90 minus theta'."
"Well if this angle up here is congruent -- (And we've constructed it so it is congruent.) the angle corresponding to theta is also going to be theta,"
And this angle right over here is also going to be 90 - theta.
"When contaminated food is ingested in the body, it weakens the immune system."
That's why the allergy aggravates and the diseases recur.
Some people claim their healed injury has started to ache again.
A weakened immune system also causes fatigue.
People with fatigue will probably become unable to extend themselves.
"About two weeks ago when we showed this data to you, you said you'd like to see a breakdown of the number of the reports according to prefectures."
So we created a map to show which prefecture those emails came from.
"And as you see here, most of them came from Tohoku and Kanto regions."
"In other words, from contaminated regions."
We are an webcast station that anyone anywhere in Japan can watch.
"Not a local TV station that can be viewed, for example, only in Kanto."
"Considering this fact, I was half-shocked and half-unsurprised to see most of the reports came from Kanto and Tohoku."
This seems to be an evidence that the connection with radiation cannot be ignored.
"Ideally, the government should be the first to conduct this kind of epidemiological research for the sake of the public health."
"The last time I went to Fukushima, I heard a story of some children in kindergartens and nursery schools in Date City in Fukusima Prefecture who aggravated a cold that lead to pneumonia and were constantly in and out of hospital, because of a weakened immune system."
This was exactly what happened in Chernobyl and I was shocked to hear that.
I really wished that such things would never ever happen in Japan.
I'm very worried by the fact that the people have been eating contaminated food and various symptoms have already emerged.
Something must be done.
"In Chernobyl, nothing was done with children for the first 3 years, which led to the high rate of cancer among them."
I'd really like the Japanese government to do something about it as soon as possible.
You went to Belarus 7 years after the Chernobyl accident and saw the situation there.
We're going to show some photos from the visit soon...
How was it?
In Belarus?
"Yes, when you visited Belarus...the photo is shown now."
"Well, they said there were no healthy children."
"If there were 100 children at school, 98 of them had some kind of health problems."
They said those children got ill when their immune systems weakened because of stress or shocking event.
"In other words, they were in the gray zone between ""healthy"" and ""ill."""
Most of the children were like ticking bombs that could explode at any minute.
"And the class length at school was shortened to something like 25 minutes, instead of 45 minutes."
We want to go find things in some data set.
And I'll remind you that we sort of a separated out two cases.
"We said if we had an ordered list, we could use binary search."
"And we said that was log rhythmic, took log n time where n is the size of the list."
"If it was an unordered list, we were basically stuck with linear search."
Got to walk through the whole list to see if the thing is there.
So that was of order in.
"And then one of the things that I suggested was that if we could figure out some way to order it, and in particular, if we could order it in n log n time, and we still haven't done that, but if we could do that, then we said the complexity changed a little bit."
But it changed in a way that I want to remind you.
"And the change was, that in this case, if I'm doing a single search, I've got a choice."
"I could still do the linear case, which is order n or I could say, look, take the list, let's sort it and then search it."
"But in that case, we said well to sort it was going to take n"
"log n time, assuming I can do that."
"Once I have it sorted I can search it in log n time, but that's still isn't as good as just doing n."
"And this led to this idea of amortization, which is I need to not only factor in the cost, but how am I going to use it?"
"And typically, I'm not going to just search once in a list, I'm going to search multiple times."
"So if I have to do k searches, then in the linear case, I got to do order n things k times."
It's order k n.
"Whereas in the ordered case, I need to get them sorted, which is still n log n, but then the search is only log n."
I need to do k of those.
And we suggested well this is better than that.
This is certainly better than that. m plus k all times log n is in general going to be much better than k times n.
"It depends on n and k but obviously as n gets big, that one is going to be better."
"And that's just a way of reminding you that we want to think carefully, but what are the things we're trying to measure when we talk about complexity here?"
It's both the size of the thing and how often are we going to use it?
"And there are some trade offs, but I still haven't said how"
"I'm going to get an n log n sorting algorithm, and that's what I want to do today."
One of the two things I want to do today.
"To set the stage for this, let's go back just for a second to binary search."
At the end of the lecture I said binary search was an example of a divide and conquer algorithm.
Sort of an Attila the Hun kind of approach to doing things if you like.
"So let me say -- boy, I could have made a really bad political joke there, which I will forego, right."
Or even just walking and taking for granted the walking that we do.
"I feel like, maybe it is contradictory  but I feel like bringing my work into my mindfulness practice actually invites me to do a lot of unlearning."
A lot of moving against the habit energy of how school functions.
"So I don't know if that is helpful, but I that's one of the things that I am finding out."
"One of my main motivations  for doing this is,"
I guess I feel like there is a lot  of things that are difficult about being a teacher.
There is a lot of things that  are difficult about working with students in terms of where they are.
I think one of the things that Thay shared in the very beginning of the retreat was about the mindfulness of suffering.
"And I know we all know somethings are complicated but I feel that there is a way to look into the students and to ask ourselves or to ask myself, what has really happened?"
"So, in California, or maybe other parts where you teach, things have gone to the point  where we are doing a lot of teaching work, but I am not really quite sure what is actually being received by the students."
"I feel here is a lot of busyness that teaching and learning can look like we are very busy working, giving this, doing that,computers are out, but what are actually students getting?"
What are we actually cultivating  in young people?
"I feel that is a hard question, but I think in my mind, but I feel that is a thing  that I've been asked to look at."
"To look at that,  so young people are only test scores."
"But that's the things that  the conversations at my school are, that's the kind of conversation that we are welded to."
"I feel the mindfulness practice gives me opportunity not to feel overwhelmed by that,  but to look at it very clearly, so that I can understand  how to respond."
I can understand how to respond.
For instance - this might be  a small example- one of my students was sometimes  hanging out at lunch.
One time he said:
"""Why do you always say Good afternoon to your fifth period class?"""
"I guess I didn't really think much of it,  I guess I just want to say that."
"He was saying, ""I don't ever hear that in my classrooms."""
"I guess I just feel like - to me that's  a moment for me to listen, to listen to what are the experiences that young people are having in the classrooms."
"Sometimes - once again, hopefully your  work environments are much more healthy-"
I think sometimes schools are very  transactional for young people.
"You do your part,  I do my part."
"Don't get into my business, I won't get in your business,"
"Time passes, turn something in, then bye-bye, bell rang."
(Laughter)
"So we are in this thing,  more like tennis, it rolls that way,  'doing the schooling thing'."
But what is really going on?
"What kind of young people  are we really preparing for the planet that we live in,  for the communities that they live in?"
"And, so lets figure out what happened at event number one."
So let's say that the twin on earth measured a time T1.
"And therefore twin on the, the twin that was traveling measured a time T prime one."
Now where did this event occurred.
"Well this event occurred at the position. x1 which is equal to vt1 because the twin was moving with speed v, but it also occurred at position x prime one."
And we know what x prime one is.
"X prime one is zero because in his own frame, the moving twin was addressed and therefore we could now set, the point is that we can now compute the invariant interval between here and here in the two different frames and set it to be the same."
"So, that tells us, and again"
"I'm not gonna maintain all of the colors, that c squared, t1 squared minus x1 squared."
Has to be equal to'c' squared't1' prime squared minus'x1' prime squared.
"But we know some things, we know'x1' prime is zero, we know that'x1' is'vt1'."
"So, c squared t1 squared minus v squared, t1 squared is c squared t1 prime squared and we do the usual calculation and we find that t1 prime is t1 times the square root."
Of one minus V squared over C squared.
"Or, written otherwise, t1 is t1 prime / by the square root of one - v^2 over c^2."
"So that, what we are saying is that this event appears to the stationary twin to have, happened at a later time than it appears to the moving twin."
Why do I know it's a later time?
Because I'm dividing by a number smaller than one.
"Well, yeah, you say, of course."
"But on the other hand, I can draw this line."
"And say that is true, but that's because I am measuring the time at event one."
I can invent an event number two here.
"Which is simultaneous with the, the, the moving twins decision to return and that event number two clearly occurs at a time."
Earlier than T one.
And if I compute I will find that in fact T two.
Is exactly't1' prime times you can compute this.
It's again these two happened at the same value of't' prime but one happened at the'x' equals zero and one happened at'x' prime equals zero.
"And the symmetry between these is of course the usual understanding that we have the stationary twin sees time dilation, sees the moving twin's clock running slow and the moving twin sees the stationary twin's clock running slow ."
So.
The twin whose coordinates are black thinks that his brother is aging slowly.
The twin whose coordinates are blue thinks his brother is aging slowly.
"So how is it that upon, but on the other hand, it is clear that since from at this point t1 is less, is clearly more than t1 prime and since this is t1 prime is how much the moving twin aged, t1 is how much the stationary twin aged."
"Since the same thing is now repeated on their return, it's clear that if this is true, then 2t1 = 2t1 prime / that and upon their return the stationary twin will be older."
I can't feed everyone that comes up to me so he's going to have to beg some scraps from the suitors.
"Now, in doing that on page 354, what Telemachus is doing is positioning his father, disguised as the beggar."
And positioning his father in such a place that he can now get to know what the lay of the land is hanging around with the suitors.
"And then, Telemachus shows his responsibility, kind of stepping up a little bit more."
"His first conversation with Penelope, he says I need to go meet my friend,"
"Theoclymenus, whom I brought with me and I need to take care of him."
He says on page 356.
"So he's starting to, sort of, step up."
He's been educated.
Let's see here in this picture of the young Telemachus getting schooled.
He's been educated and he's now ready to start taking responsibility for some of the things in this house.
"Closing off, book seventeen, there's a different statement that comes out"
Telemachus' mouth than the one that we're used to seeing him.
"Remember in those early books, he's constantly talking about how the gods are not on my side, if only the gods were on my side, the gods are giving awful things to me."
"He now says what heroes say at the close of seventeen, page 374."
"I'll tend to all things here, I and the deathless gods."
Now this is what a hero does.
"Yeah, sure, it's up to the gods, but it's also up to me."
There's an understood double determination in the events that go on for a hero in the events that a hero is responsible for.
"Yeah, sure, the gods steers all things but that doesn't mean that the hero is not, therefore, also responsible for what happens in, in the, the, the purview of the hero, what's going on in their terrain."
The theme carries on in book eighteen.
"Telemachus is still hovering around the center of the city, and when he sees"
"Odysseus as this beggar, and Iris, the other lowly beggar."
"The two of them are about to get into a fight and there's nasty words back and forth and they take oaths at the beginning So if I win, this happens."
"If you win, that happens."
This all unfolds on page 377.
"Odysseus, Telemachus at that point steps up and says okay, you all can, can count on me to guarantee the oaths that you've just taken."
I am going to be the guarantor of the oaths that you all just taken so go ahead and have your fight but under the understanding that I'm going to make sure that what you all agree to is going to get executed in the end.
That kind of authority to execute on someone else's promises is the kind of thing that someone who's in charge of a situation takes.
So Telemachus is showing himself to be that way.
"After Penelope in Book eighteen points out how this stranger Odysseus was abused by the suitors, he jumps in and starts to take responsibility for that situation too."
"And so at this point on, page 383, that"
"Just tell us whether you are her, or not.""*"
"*""We'll find out now.Vural, pass the bottle here.""*"
"*""Pour it on her."" *"
"*""I recognize this body.It's definitely her.""*"
You casted upon me the vilest violenceand the heaviest injustice.
You soiled my life with your own filth.
You brutally pillaged the life of someone you didn't even know.
Now look into my eyes and say your lies.
What the world wanted to see was how you would react.
And you all have reacted with joy and resolve.
"You've shown that your power will not be intimidated by any power that they have, and that's the most important thing that's happened here this week."
Because everything that went on inside that building tried to convince me that I was alone and that I was weak.
They tried to convince me that I was like a little finger out there on my own that could easily be broken.
"And all of you out here where the reminder for all of us that I wasn't just a finger all alone in there, but that I was connected to hand with many fingers that could be united as one fist, and that that fist could not be broken by the power that they have in there."
That fist is not a symbol of violence.
That fist is a symbol that we will not be mislead into thinking we are alone.
We will not be lied to and told that we are weak.
We will not be divided and we will not back down.
That fist is a symbol that we are connected and that we are powerful.
It's a symbol that we hold true to our vision of a healthy and just world and we are building the self empowering movement to make it happen.
"All those authorities in there wanted me to think like a finger, but our children are calling to us to think like a fist."
"And we know that now I'll have to go prison, we know that now that is the reality."
But that's just the job that I have to do.
That's the role that I face.
And many before me have gone to jail for justice and if we're gonna achieve our vision many after me will have to join me as well.
[People shouting:
"""I'll join you"" , cheering]"
Nobody ever told us that this battle would be easy.
Nobody ever told us that we wouldn't have to make sacrifices.
We knew that when we started this fight.
"Every wave on the ocean that has ever risen up and refused to lay back down has been dashed on the shore, but it is the very purpose of a wave to rise up, because once it rises above the horizon it finally has the perspective to see that it's not just a wave, that it's a part of a mighty ocean."
[Cheering]
They need nutrients.
Where are they going to get it?
Student:
Weathering or--
Prof:
They could get it from weathering or they could get it from upwelling.
Where does upwelling occur?
Student:
On a costal reef.
Prof:
"Yeah, continental margins."
"Get out in the middle of the ocean and there's actually a tremendous amount of fertilizer there but it's five miles down, three to five miles down, and you just can't get it up."
"It's sealed off, because the top of the ocean is warm and the bottom of the ocean is cold, and there's no way that cold water can come up through warm water, unless you have Coriolis force or wind or something like that driving it."
So that's why the open oceans are deserts.
You'll notice that tropical rainforests are highly productive per square meter.
In general forests are pretty productive.
Swamps and streams are very productive.
"Algal beds and reefs are quite productive, and so are estuaries."
"So if you want to go someplace where you're-- you know, you're a naturalist, you like creepy-crawlies, you want frogs in your pocket, you want to see something new for Christmas, you go to these places; that's where you'll see a lot of stuff."
Okay?
"So right there you already know where the prospecting is good, if you like to see lots of biodiversity."
"Now if you look at percent contribution to global primary production, the open oceans again crop up, and that is because there's just so darn much of them."
"If you're out there in space, looking at the world, you realize that you can fit all of the continents into the"
Pacific Ocean; it's bigger than all the continents put together.
And most of it is open ocean; most of it is low primary productivity open ocean.
But there's just so darn much of it that on the planetary scale it's making a pretty good contribution.
"And the tropical rainforests are big enough so that even though they're only 3 and a half or 4% of the globe, they have such high primary productivity that they're kicking in quite a bit."
"And the others, even though they are productive, occupy such a small portion of the globe that they're not contributing that much."
"Okay, so this is an overall view of energy flow on the planet, at least for the photosynthetically driven part of the planet."
The sun is sending in the energy.
"And by the way, any idea of roughly how much of the sunlight that comes into the planet is actually captured by"
life?
We keep on going on like that.
We'll go out 1000 different steps.
"Each of these will be a distinct state, because this will be the state with time t equals 0."
"Here time t equals 1, t equals 2, t equals 3."
"But really, although it looks like we're getting different states, in another way of looking at it, we're always getting the same state."
We're just going back and forth from here to there and back to here and back and back.
We're going around in circles.
"In order to recognize that these are in fact the same states, we're going to have to take t out of our state, and we're going to have to deal with the t someplace else."
"We want our representation of a state to be just (here, there)."
We've got to figure out someplace else to put the t.
"I'm not sure what the right way to do it is, but why don't we do it this way?"
"We have a path, which is state, action, state dot, dot, dot-- keeps on alternating between states and actions."
"Let's change that so that the path is a state followed by a tuple of the action and the total time it took after applying that action, then the next state, then the next action and the total time after applying that, and so on."
That'll be our new representation.
"States are going to look like that, and paths are going to look like that."
"Now, I want you to write the new successor function for the bridge problem."
"We'll call it bsuccessors2--the ""2"" just to keep it distinct from the first version."
Again it returns a dict of state-action pairs.
"A state now is just a two-tuple of (here, there), and the here and there are still frozen sets."
It's pretty much the same except we dropped out the time t.
Go ahead and implement that for me.
"Hey Pokémon fans, I'm JWittz and for today's Pokémon fact of the day, we're going back to the Pokédex to talk about more reasons why it is NONSENSE!"
Now I've done plenty of videos in my extended series on weird and creepy Pokémon Pokédex entries (and I'm sure I'll do more of those in the future) but for now we're going to talk about something a little different: sizes and weights.
They don't make any sense.
Just how big is a Charizard?
"Big enough to ride, right?"
"If you're asking Game Freak, you might be wrong."
"Despite Pokémon having the most successful long-lasting media franchises of the past two decades, size just seems to be one of the things they can't keep consistent."
"Most of the time, we think we have a good grasp on the size of Pokémon thanks to the TV show, other shows we've seen, and referencing Pokémon to real life animals."
"But when you look at the official, cannonical sizes from the games themselves, things are a little messed up."
"For starters, the anime differs from the games greatly by having the occasional giant pokémon appear."
"This never really bothered me as a kid, but today it just baffles me for some reason."
"Now in the interest of time, I'm going to leap to 1777, because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding throughout the northern states and some people then began to conclude that actually staying in New Haven and studying at Yale might be just too dangerous for Yale students-- because New Haven was an exposed port, which we're going to see in about five minutes."
It is an exposed port.
So the Yale authorities sent students out to different towns.
They didn't close Yale.
"They just said, 'Okay."
We're going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be safer than they are in New Haven.'
"So freshmen went to Farmington, sophomores and juniors went to"
"Glastonbury, and seniors went to Wethersfield."
I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like
"logical places, but you and your class were sent to a random place to continue your studies."
"On their way out, Yale officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings from troops--"
"American or British--troops, and some library books were moved inland to protect them in case troops came to New Haven."
"So again, people are feeling there's a potential real threat here."
"Yale eventually did come back into session in New Haven, not without serious problems--and again you're going to see the playing out here of something I've talked about before."
I've talked before about the problems of supplying the army.
It was hard to get food.
People weren't sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.
"Apparently, they--it was really hard for people to get food and supplies into Yale too, that people just weren't--whatever sources of supplies had been serving Yale in the past were no longer doing that in a time of war."
"So in 1778, Yale sent out the following notice to parents of"
Yale students.
"September 30,1778:"
"""The steward of Yale"
College hereby requests the Parents and Guardians of the
"Students to assist in furnishing a supply of Provisions""-- okay, 'parents, would you please send food?"
[laughs]
"We don't have a lot; we really need it'--'""without which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist the Scholars the ensuing winter."
A generous and full Price shall be allowed and paid either in
"Money, or their Son's Quarter Bills, shall be most agreeable."""
Okay.
'Please send us food.
"We don't have any, and if you do we'll either pay you or we won't charge you tuition for your son so please give us food'-- which again--Can you imagine being the parent who gets the sorry, there's no food for your son; [laughter] send some now?"
"While you're sending the homespun clothes, send the food too."
And you can just do a little Math to get to xi+1 you take.
"Xi, we don't care about the first digit anymore, so you subtract it off."
Multiply by r and then add the new digit.
That's like one step of Horner's method.
"Now, then you have to take that computation and you can do mod q all the way through."
All you have to do is pre-compute r to the n+1 mod q And so here's the computation for one example.
"If we're at this position 41592 and we know 41592 mod q we can compute 15926 mod q by subtracting off 40,000."
"The TiR-1 and that gives us just the four digits, multiply by the radix add the new trailing digit and that's the new value."
And if we just keep that all mod q then we can with just a multiply and an add at each step we can keep a running total of the Modular hash value of the five digit thing.
"So, for example, this is the case that, that we just did 4152 on 997 is, is done by ex, exactly as we said we subtract and then add and then multiply by the radix mod 997."
"So, doing those calculations all the way through the search, we eventually get to a match."
That's again remarkably small amount of code.
We're going to keep a long random prime.
Just keep it a little smaller than the biggest long value to avoid overflow.
So we pre-compute r to the m - one mod q
'cause that's the little calculation that we have to do.
We compute the hash function.
And for the pattern.
"And then, with those pre-computations, the search is extremely straight forward."
So we take our current hash value.
"And this is just, add a q make sure it's positive."
And subtract off rm times the first character in then add in the next character mod q.
And that gives us the text hash for the current position.
And then we compare to see if that's equal to the pattern hash.
Now there's this is an introduction to the idea of randomized algorithms.
There's two ways to proceed from here.
One way called Monte Carlo version.
"Where we guaratee that the algorithm is gonna be quick but with low probability, it might get the answer wrong."
In that version we don't ever bother to check whether the go through and check all digits to see if there's actually a match.
"We take queue large enough so that we're confident the probability of the, to, two digit numbers or two m digit numbers having the same hash value."
"And so low that we're not gonna worry about it, that's called the Monte Carlo version."
The Las Vegas version is guarateed to get the right answer.
"And if you like big numbers and you like to calculate and look at flow models and compartment models and differential equations and stuff like that, biogeochemistry has a place for you."
"The contact here is with geology, physical chemistry and meteorology."
The connections are important.
They're not all well worked out.
"So there must be important connections between ecosystem ecology and community ecology, but they are still being explored, and this is not an area that's really mature yet."
"The part of ecology that analyses these processes really is the part that deals with the fate of the planetary environment, especially water and air, and that means it has important economic and political implications."
"So it's an area well worth worrying about and learning something about and remembering, because these are the processes that will affect the quality of human life on the planet, for forever basically."
"Okay, next time I'm going to discuss biodiversity, and about whether it matters or not, and about what extinctions mean."
Now we enter Part Two of the Crash Course.
"Here you'll see the very information that led me and my family to make profound changes in our lives - where we live, my line of work, even where we get our food."
"With the background you've received to this point, you are now positioned to understand how the Three ""E""s, the Economy, Energy and the Environment, intersect and seemingly converge on a very narrow window of the future, what I am calling ""The Twenty-Teens""."
It's the data in these next parts
leads me to conclude that the next twenty years are going to be completely unlike the last twenty years.
A small warning:
This material can be shocking.
"So we begin Part Two with ""Debt""."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"Young man, if you are trying to impress me, you are not."
It's not working.
"For him, that was the end of life."
We had to do a little work to get him back.
"To cut the story short, my son went on to graduate with honors from Waterloo, one of Canada's top universities."
(Applause)
"You need to have the bravado, to challenge the odds that life throws against you."
"OK, let's do a show of hands here."
How many of you use Facebook?
"Wow, I'm really in the wrong business."
(Laughter)
"Twitter, Google, I suppose everybody."
"How many of you know Aramex, Fadi Ghandour?"
"Well, if you look at the background of all these people, they are just ordinary people like you and me."
I hope Fadi Ghandour doesn't mind me calling him ordinary.
"And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down."
"Both 8 and 10 share common factors, they are both divisible by 2."
So lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
"We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done."
"0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing as 4 fifths."
"Welcome, hope you had a good summer."
"I just wanted to talk about the class since there's about a week or so left before it starts, believe it or not."
"I, I have put something on the set, on the web."
And it's a detailed syilabus for the class.
And I would encourage you to take the opportunity to read it.
It's a big document simply because I want to give you clear sense of what you're going to get into.
And you want to make a decision that this class is good for you or not.
And even though you have resisted I encourage you to read it.
It gives you a good sense.
"But what I'm going to do in the video is I though I would give you visual idea and talk to you about the class, and it reflects what's in the syilabus."
"But hopefully, easier to follow, and motivate you to go read the syilabus."
The first main thing I will talk about are the objectives of the class.
"And to me, the main objective, the first one, is to learn how to value assets."
Assets are what create value in the world.
"And if you know which is a better asset than the other in terms of creating value for the world, I think you're on board."
"You're going to make good decisions, and that's the second, if you may, practical."
"Purpose of this class, to understand value, to make good decisions."
"And if you can make good decisions, it kind of empowers you, to feel comfortable in a very uncertain world."
"You're not guaranteed to make great decisions, but you will probabilistically make better decisions and that's what you want."
I want you to understand your environment and what public policy's all about.
Why is that important?
"Because, as"
"I said, Finance's beauty is about valuing assets but making real life decisions and all of this happens within a context and in fact the context is an outcome of our actions."
"So if you understand the interaction between decisions and what's happening and public policy, it will help you."
Now will it be a perfect understanding?
No.
"But I guarantee you when you read the popular press, you'll be able to understand things a bit better."
"Ethnic media outlets, like Iwi radio stations."
There's 22 of those.
There's two Pacific radio stations.
"There's Māori Television now, which is having a major impact."
"Pay television, online news websites, and of course social networks,"
"like Facebook and Bebo, and a strange thing called Twitter."
Anyone in the room Twitter?
"Yeah, Twitter is now the way that most news is broken worldwide."
"The Chinese earthquake was first heard of via someone under a desk somewhere, as the building was crashing around them,"
"Twittering to their network, sort of like text messages sent out to a network."
"And it strikes me that these are things that the young people are into, and the research needs to include that."
"Now what about my friends in the news media, how have they contributed to the debate?"
"Well, very defensively."
"No primary research on the effects in New Zealand has been commissioned by the Media Freedom Committee, so far as I can see."
"They had Jim Tully do a fairly limited review, no more than a literature review, from what I could see."
"The limited examinations I've seen have really concentrated on trying to discredit overseas research used by the Ministry's consultants and researchers, a pretty big task, after what we saw today."
And the result's pretty pallid.
"Someone picked up the fact that, in a paper, a researcher had misspelled ""causal"" as ""casual"" and was hugely excited about that."
But frankly I don't see that it was a fatal blow to the credibility of the paper.
"The news media industry as a whole in this country does little, if any, primary research on anything."
They do...
"Individual media companies do a lot of commercial research on readership and sales and stuff, but you never get to see that."
"So I'm not aware that they do any research on media effects, and they're not interested."
It's too expensive.
"So if they want to challenge the Ministry's position, frankly, they need to spend some money and do some research."
"I have a little bit of a problem with researching this topic, though, because we have such a restrictive regime."
"How can we really tell what the effects are if there is no, in effect, news reporting of suicide, other than name and the fact that it was self-inflicted?"
"So I'm not quite sure how you're going to gauge that, Brian."
"I'm sure you'll explain, but it strikes me as a kind of Catch-22."
"There have been some other problems with the press, the news media's response."
"The Press Council said that something had to be done about this because of the increasing problem, especially for young people."
It's a false premise.
But if you spill it on yourself you should know that it is going to burn and it is going to be hot!
It is coffee.
As a matter of fact I bet you would be angry if your coffee wasn't hot!
"I don't know, I don't drink it."
I imagine you would be.
Haha.
"So, I am not talking about that kind of litigation, but I am talking about you deserve the product that you were promised."
And this chapter does a good job of giving you some information on that so make sure you read all about that.
"As I look at the end of the chapter, once again, make sure you go through the chapter summary."
"There are the Key Terms, make sure you understand those."
There is some self-test problems.
There are no formulas this week in here so that is good.
But the same end of chapter information as always.
"So, I hope that with major purchases in your future that this chapter has really helped you."
And I hope the next time you buy a car you will take into consideration some of the things I have shared with you and some of the things that you read in your book.
"So, happy shopping!"
Let's review a little bit of everything we learned so far and hopefully it'll make everything fit together a little bit better.
Then we'll do a bunch of calculations with real numbers and I think it'll really hit the point home.
"So, first of all if we're dealing with a-- let me actually write down, let me make some columns."
"So if we're dealing with-- let's see, we could call it the concept and then we'll call it whether we're dealing with a population or a sample."
So the first statistical concept we came up with was the notion of the mean or the central tendency and we learned of that was one way to measure the average or central tendency of a data set.
The other ways were the median and the mode.
"But the mean tends to show up a lot more, especially when we start talking about variances and, as we'll do in this video, the standard deviation."
But the mean of a population we learned-- we use the greek
letter Mu-- is equal to the sum of each of the data points in the population.
That's an i.
Let me make sure it looks like an I.
So you're going to sum up each of those data points.
You're going to start with the first one and you're going to go to the nth one.
We're assuming that there are n data points in the population.
And then you divide by the total number that you have.
"Even if you're just depressed, I'm sure, I'm sure that you're hanging out with people, who probably aren't good for you."
This could even be a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

"What I'd encourage you to do is take out that journal, that I told you to purchase, hopefully a long time ago you go it, you've been jotting down notes."
But today
"I'd like you to make a list of the people that you spend the most time with, and just make note, take note of what they say to you, take note of how you feel when you leave them, when you've spent a couple hours,"
I hope you feel better not worse.
"And so we'll stop, you know, we'll stop torturing ourselves when we surround ourselves with bad negative energy."
"It's much more refreshing to spend time around people who, just build us up, they're there to support."
"So, I hope that's helpful."
"Continue to make your comments and to share this, if you're on Linkedln, if your on Tumbler, if you're on Google+, share this with people."
This can be helpful for anybody!
"This can be helpful for your mom, your friend, your brother all of us need to be supported by people who love us and care for us."

So that's where his account ends.
Now we're going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his own account afterwards of what happened.
Okay.
"""On Monday morning, the 5^(th) instant the town of"
"New Haven was justly alarmed, with the threatening appearance of a speedy invasion from the Enemy."
Numbers went out armed to oppose them....
"Having gone as far as I supposed was sufficient,"
I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which
"I had in my eye; but to my great surprise I saw the Enemy much nearer than I expected, their advance guards being a little more than 20 rods distant, with plain open ground between us."
"They instantly fired upon me, which they continued till I had run a dozen rods, discharging not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone; however thro' the preserving providence of God, I escaped from them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which I aimed, which concealed me from their view, while I could plainly see them thro' the weeds and bushes, advancing towards me within 12 rods."
"I singled out one of them, took aim and fired upon him."""
Okay.
So he takes one shot.
"""I loaded my musket again, but determined not to discharge it any more, as I saw I could not escape from them [laughs] and I determined to surrender myself as a prisoner."""
"So he's charged out with his gun, he takes one shot, and he's like: 'what am I doing?"
[laughter]
I'm a guy with a gun and the
British Army.
What am I doing?'
"He's like: 'okay, I'll surrender myself as a prisoner.'"
"""I begged for Quarter and that they would spare my life."
"They drew near to me, I think two only in number, one on my right hand, the other on my left, the fury of infernals glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they would kill me instantly."
"They demanded, quote, 'What did you fire upon us for?'"" [laughter]"
Okay.
I love the question.
"'Why are you shooting at us, you old crazy man sitting in the bushes?'"
"""I replied, 'because it is the exercise of war.'"" [laughter]"
That did not impress the
"British, and apparently, they actually--they didn't treat him very well so they-- one of them pretended to stab at him with his bayonet and actually stabbed him a little bit, and some of them sort of [laughter] hit him on the head, and there's a long account here which I don't have time to read in which he talks about: 'this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me on the shin and then some guy hit me with the barrel of his gun.'"
"And he actually--he ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to New Haven, from wherever he is."
"And he says I think in his account, 'I finally--I saw the"
New Haven green and I was so happy I was back in New Haven.'
"But boss, where am I gonna put all this stuff?"
"I mean, a storage room is almost full, I can't even walk in there."
"The next topic I want to address is called ""Segmentation."""
"This is the problem of given a sequence of language, figure out how to break it up into words."
"Now, in Chinese we don't have spaces between the words, and so in order to understand if the first word of this message corresponds to a single character or two characters or what, we have to be able to do the process of segmentation and figure out where they are."
"In English, we don't have that."
Words have spaces between them.
"So we don't have the segmentation problem, but we certainly have it in speech recognition in languages like English, because this speech sounds are sometimes run together without pauses in between them, and there are places where we do have a language without segmentation."
"For example, in the language of URLs you could have a URL like ""choosespain.com"", which is the travel site that tries to encourage you to choose Spain as your travel destination, but if you segment it wrong, you'd come up with ""chooses pain,"" which would not be the intended expression for that particular URL."
So segmentation is an important problem.
Let's talk about how to do it.
So welcome.
"In this next module, I'm going to be talking with Dr. Gary Friedman."
I'm thrilled to have him here today.
I've mentioned his name a few times in this course.
"He provided a number of the, examples that"
I've shared with you.
And he's been a long-time champion of good writing in the medical literature.
"So, it's great to have him here today."
"He was, he has been an editor at the American Journal of Epidemiology for over two decades, and was the Director of the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California for almost a decade, and also is on the editorial board of a number of other journals and currently a consulting professor at"
Stanford.
"So I really appreciate you being here today, Gary."
"Oh, thank you."
It's a pleasure.
"So I'm just gonna start by asking obviously, we need to do good science."
"But besides good science, what are those, some of the key elements that journal editors are looking for when they get a paper."
"Well, one is novelty."
Mm-hm.
"That's we will often reject a paper without even sending it out for peer review, if it's just a repeat of findings that are already well know."
"I mean, if you're writing the thirtieth paper on alcohol and how alcohol is related."
"It to high blood pressure, or obesity is related to mortality."
"Don't expect people to be very enthusiastic [laugh], about it."
[laughter]
[tone]
Go very slowly.
[tone]
Who has found clear location where [tone] the sound is nearly zero [tone] or practically zero?
[tone]
Most of you.
And you certainly can hear if you move that there's an enormous difference [tone] in sound intensity.
[tone]
[tone]
"So again, who has found locations [tone] whereby you clearly say this is practically silence?"
[tone]
"Ah, you see them all the way in the back, [tone]"
"[tone] and the separation, how far you have to move, depends on how far you are away from me."
Sit down again.
[audience noise]
Young was a sound engineer and as a sound engineer he was very familiar with the interference of sound.
He knew that sound and sound can make silence.
And so in 1801 he demonstrated in a convincing way that light plus light can create darkness.
"That would be the nail in the coffin that would demonstrate uniquely that light are indeed waves, and there was still this controversy between Huygens and Newton as you perhaps remember."
Newton wanted light to be particles but Huygens wanted them to be waves.
And the way that Young did his experiment is as follows.
"He had a screen, don't think of it as this big, you're talking now about extraordinarily small dimensions, you will understand shortly how small, and in this screen are two openings, two pinholes, and light is coming from the left and think of light as being plane waves."
"They reach these two openings and these two openings according to Huygens will produce circular waves, spherical waves of course, three-dimensionally."
These openings become Huygens sources and spherical waves will propagate out in this direction.
And so now we have exactly the situation that we had with our sound.
Now if all works well there should be directions theta away from this line where you see darkness and other directions where you see bright light.
"And we are going to do it in a way, we have the luxury of laser beams, so we have very strong"
"light sources, which Young did not have."
"The way we are going to do it, we have a -- a slide, which is completely black, but with a razor blade two"
lines have been drawn on it.
And so I will draw these lines as white lines.
"And at the same time, in other parallel universes... the same cat can be alive and kicking."
But how?
How can you have a dead cat and a live cat simultaneously?
Because the universe splits in half.
"In one universe, we have a dead cat."
"In the other universe, we have a live cat."
Get used to it.
What is even more shocking... is that in some of these many worlds... a tiny quantum difference in thought can change the whole world.
It's like the butterfly that flaps its wing and makes the hurricane.
Tiny microscopic events would change the course of history.
"So every historical event actually happened... in every possible way in some branch... of this ever-splitting, many-worlds universe."
"In one, the Nazis won World War Il."
"In which case, I'm now speaking German... and there's a swastika behind me."
In another world... none of the horror ever happened.
"In one universe, there's no World War Il... and 50 or so million people didn't have to die."
"Like the endless rolls of the dice, all possible numbers... and all possible kinds of universes and outcomes... will eventually turn up and occur in one of these many worlds."
"In fact, all our wishes, too, can come true... in a parallel universe."
If the many worlds idea is right... then there's a branch of the universe... in which the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year.
"You can imagine that the USA was still a colony... of the British, for example."
Even the impossible is probable in some parallel universe.
There could even be creatures coming into our world... from these mysterious extra dimensions.
"As mind-boggling as it sounds... when it comes to the amazing world of parallel universes... anything that can happen has happened or will happen... in some other universe... in some other dimension, space, and time."
Quantum differences can rewrite history... creating multiple universes... each with wildly different outcomes... where anything and everything is possible.
Some wars never happened.
Others we never imagined did.
A slight change means a comet missed... and even dinosaurs still roam some Earth somewhere.
"All and every one of these fantastic parallel universes... occupy the same space... but are in a different dimension, and so invisible to us."
Even as you peacefully watch TV... whole other invisible worlds could be raging all around you.
These parallel universes are in your living room.
"This means that in your living room, there are dinosaurs."
You can't hear them.
You can't see the dinosaurs... that are rampaging throughout your living room... but they're there.
Ole:
"That which we started about a decade ago, has begun at all business schools connecting art and economy and it is becoming more and more common, which is logical because where the hell would you draw the resources to be innovative from when you need to be innivativ all the time?"
"With violence and power there is almost only art left .. and as you begun with .. philosophy, right?"
Martin:
Both have done badly for some years
Ole:
They have but begins to turn back strongly
Martin:
"Well, you have some power now ... if I could pull some strings so you had A LOT of power in all parts of the world.. what would you do structurally, to face some of these crises?"
Ole:
I would make a society which is based on a lot smaller units
The Danish society I would base on a community with semi large municipalities
"That would run their own training concept, that would run their hospitals and would take responsibility for their young and old and completely developed their own alternative form of production"
Martin:
So the opposite of what we do today?
Ole:
Exactly the opposite of what we are doing today!
And then I would try in some way to stop tourism because it is the most CO2 consuming and time-wasting in the world but we can't do that because that would be totalitarianism and who should have the right to travel and what would a valid ticket be?
I myself am a delicate pensioner..
"No, I won't dwell on traveling"
But then I would...
"And I don't know how the hell I should solve it... but I would try to make the developing countries, such as Africa, proud of their culture so they with violence and force wouldn't try to take over our countries"
"like China and India are trying to... it creates an immense amount of problems on this globe in terms of resources and economic structuring and so on, right?"
Why the hell don't they hold on to their own way of life?
Ole:
"But if I had real power,,,,"
Martin:
"You will have, if you want..."
Ole:
Then would I influence them through their upbringing and their education to believe that what they stand for is really something that is worth a lot and that they should not take over our way of life
Martin:
But perhaps it has also something to do with food ...
"Because they're in the remote corners of those three countries, and the roads are awful, they're still very isolated."
They're still very self-sufficient.
They grow their own food.
They get water from springs.
They use local materials to make furniture and houses.
"They used to have kings and courts and armies and nobles, but colonialism put an end to all that."
"There are wondrous musicians, and they carry libraries of knowledge and stories in their heads."
The first person to write about the Zande was an anthropologist named Evans Pritchard.
"He lived among the Zande in southern Sudan for almost 2 years in the late 1920s, and he wrote this classic book, ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Zande""."
"Over 50 years later, I found myself in Zande Land."
"As a Peace Corps volunteer, that was when I was young and glamorous-- is a Peace Corps volunteer in the Central African Republic, I taught high school for three years and most of my students were Zande."
I returned to Zande Land several times to do fieldwork for my graduate degrees at the University of Paris.
My own experience with witchcraft matched up pretty well with Evans Pritchard's account.
"In English, the word witch conjures up images of old ladies with warts on their noses wearing pointy hats and riding on broomsticks."
"Zande witch is, on the other hand look like regular people."
"There your family, friends, and neighbors."
"For the Zande, some people happen to be born with a special power inside of them that can cause harm when it heats up."
And it tends to heat up in a person gets angry or jealous or is offended or feels cheated.
"When someone's witchcraft heats up, bad things happen."
The best way to explain what witchcraft does is to use an example from Evans Pritchard.
It's common for the Zande to sit under granaries during the heat of the day.
"So one day there are two men sitting under the granary, and they're just talking; chatting as friends do, and suddenly it collapses on top of them and kills them."
"If you ask a Zande the question, why did the granary collapse, just like the bridge engineer, the Zande will be able to tell you structural deficiencies."
"The posts were rotten, the termites were eating away at the posts, and so it collapsed."
But that answer is not sufficient for the Zande.
"They will also ask, why did the granary collapse of the precise moment when those two men were sitting under it?"
Why didn't it collapsed an hour earlier or an hour later?
Why didn't those two men sit at another granary that day?
So the answer to that question is witchcraft.
"In other words, witchcraft does not explain why a granary or a bridge collapses, but it does explain why a particular person is under that granary or on that bridge when it does collapse."
Another example is a hunter killed by an elephant.
Several men go on a hunt.
"And so we're at a stage now, where we're running more than 20 projects, where we have humans and robots  collaborating together."
"We have the robotics systems that take the data,"
"like poor Kepler up in space, and then we have the humans down here on Earth, who are able to analyze the data."
So humans and robots are able to work together in harmony.
Except that it never works like that.
We've all seen the Sci-Fi movies.
"We all know that the robots  always go wrong in the end, and this is the vision of my nightmare."
"This is the future that we're heading towards, expect it doesn't quite look like this, it looks more like this."
"Because this particular machine that's going to run roughshod over our classifiers, is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope."
This is a telescope being built right now.
It's going to be on a mountaintop in Chile.
It's as big as the biggest telescopes in the world right now.
But it's a survey telescope.
It's going to scan the whole sky once every 3 nights.
"And it's no exaggeration to say, it's going provide a movie of the universe."
We're going to see all the asteroids whizzing around the solar system.
We're going to see all stars flickering as they have star spots.
"We're going to see the planets, we'll catch those transits."
"And we're going to see the centers of galaxies flicker, as material falls down into the black holes that lurk within their centers."
But to cope with LSST is going to be a challenge.
It's going to produce roughly 30 terabytes of reduced data each and every night.
If all we care about is things that change in the universe --
"let's simplify the problem: a conservative estimate is that we're going to have half a million alerts, every single night."
"Even if all of you, even if everyone watching, even if we all commit to doing Galaxy Zoo and its friends, we're not going to cope with this."
So we need new solutions to combine the machine with the human.
"But luckily, there are things we can do."
The first thing we can do is we can just be smarter about using people's attention.
We could pay attention to what it is that machines can do.
Maybe they can classify the routine events.
We can let them do that and we can give only those things that really need human attention to the humans.
The other thing we could do is that we can educate our volunteers.
"We can use the power of the Zooniverse, the power of citizen science to train up a generation of volunteers, so that they're able to take on the task of dealing with the truly unusual things that LSST is able to provide us."
"And like Frank Borzage, Robsen and Lewten take this as an opportunity to embellish detail and atmosphere."
In the film.
"The film is a web of repeated and varied motifs, like knives."
"There are knives in the window in the very beginning of the film, and then Finn has a knife as our hero goes on board."
"There's a bayonet on the wall of Stone's office, and of course the film ends in a knife fight."
"Or there's the picture of Ellen on Stone's desk, which is put on top of a navigation map."
Which pretty much sums up Stones problem with his relationship.
"Or there's the way that the men have to be careful to coil the rope in just the right direction, which then echoes the way that"
Louie has to coil the chain the right way in the chain lock.
And the reason I picked this film is that sound is so important to its texture.
Just think about how many times hearing and sound are mentioned or made important to the plot.
The film begins with a blind beggar.
There's Finn who cannot speak but hears what other men can't hear.
Our hero's best friend is a radio man who puts on his headphones to block out the madness of the captain.
"When Bound talks to our hero, he says he better pull in his ears and not criticize the captain."
"The crew on the ship, does their job by using sound, not by necessarily speech."
"On the bridge, someone will ring a bell, and on the deck, that bell will be answered."
"Fog horns are, of course, important becasue they turn sound into space, they tell, they map space and dangers at sea"
Through sound.
"Billy Rad sings on the boat, to entertain the crew, but he's also expressing the real feelings of the crew."
"And since this is an inexpensive film, they can't afford to show sailors in front of actual sea."
"The most we get is a sailor in front of a the backdrop with the cloud painted on it, moving up and down a little bit."
"So, sound takes over."
The sound of the wind and the sound of the sea.
"And depending on where you are on ship, you're either the wind or the sea."
Or the sound of the engines of the boat.
And they become oppressive and meaningful across the film.
It's also an excellent film for illustrating how most Hollywood film makers use sound.
"Mixing ambient sounds and side effects, keeping dialogue on top, then bringing in an underscore orchestral music score to tell us the character's emotions even if the character isn't directly expressing them as emotions."
So I would like to take a look at.
"Bits of this film beginning at the opening scene, and think about how Robson and"
Lewton make sound important to their atmospheric horror.
So then let's look at the implementation side of this and I have an implementation in here I want to get rid of.
Sorry about this but I
left the old one in here.
That will do all the things that will need to get done.
Okay.
So let's deal with at the beginning.
"Starting off, right, we will set the cursor to zero."
"So that's the vector gets started, initialize empty, and nothing else I need to do with the vector."
"A character [inaudible] cursor position in that, and then moving the cursor position forward, it's mostly just doing this, right, cursor plus, plus, right."
It's just an easy index to move it down.
But
I do need to make sure that the cursor isn't already at the end.
So if the cursor is less than the size of the vector then I will let it advance.
But it never gets beyond the size itself.
So
like all of these are going to have same problems.
"Like, if I'm already at the end and somebody asks me to advance, I don't want to suddenly get my cursor in some lax stated that sort of back that."
"Similarly, on this one, if the cursor is greater than zero, all right, then we can back it up and move the cursor around."
Moving the cursor at the start is very easy.
"Moving the cursor to the end is, also, very easy, right."
We have a convention about what it is.
"And so then inserting a character is, also, pretty easy because all the hard work is done by the vector."
"When I say insert this new character at the cursor position, right, then this character advance the cursor to be kind of past it, and then deleting the character, also, pretty easy."
"Let me show you, before I go finishing the cursor, I just want to show you this little diagram of what's happening while I'm doing stuff."
So this is kind of a visualization of the things that are happening.
So this is showing the vector and its length.
And then the cursor position as we've done things.
"Inserted six characters, the cursor's currently sitting at the end, and for the length of the cursor, actually, the same value right now."
If
"I issue a back command, right, that deducts the cursor by one, it shows another one backs up by one, and then eventually the cursor gets to the position zero and subsequent backs don't do anything to it, it just kind of bounces off the edge."
"And moving forward, things are easier to deal with."
"It will advance until the gets to the length, the size of that text, and it won't go any further."
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
I'm very proud of you.
You did very well on the last exam.
Class average is a little bit above 70.
Congratulations.
There were 22 students who scored 100.
"Many of you are interested in where the dividing line is between C and D. If I take only the three exams into account, forget the quizzes, forget the homework, forget the motor, and you add up the three grades of your three exams, the dividing line between C and D will be somewhere in the region 135 to 138."
So you can use that for your calibration where you stand.
The controversy between Newton and Huygens about the nature of
light was settled in 1801 when Young demonstrated convincingly that light shows all the characteristic of waves.
"Now in the early twentieth century, the particle character of light surfaced again and this mysterious and very fascinating duality of being waves and particles at the same time is now beautifully merged in quantum mechanics."
But today I will focus on the wave character only.
"Very characteristic for waves are interference patterns which are produced by two sources, which simultaneously produce traveling waves at exactly the same frequency."
Let this be source number one and let this be source number two.
"And they each produce waves with the same frequency, therefore the same wavelength, and they go out let's say in all directions."
"They could be spherical, in the case of water surface, going out like rings."
And suppose you were here at position P in space at a distance R1 from source number one and at a distance R2 from source number two.
Then it is possible that at the point P the two waves that arrive are in phase with each other.
"That means the mountain from two arrives at the same time as a mountain from one, and the valley from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
So the mountains become higher and the valleys become lower.
We call that constructive interference.
"It is also possible that the waves as they arrive at point P are exactly 180 degrees out of phase, so that means that the mountain from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
"In which case they can kill each other, and that we call destructive interference."
I had a dream my life would be...
So different from this hell I'm living- so different now from what it seemed...
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed. piano
"Hi, my name is Nat McCullough on behalf of Expert Village."
"In these clips, we're going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace a front wheel drives vehicles ball joint."
"In this clip, we're going to talk about removal of the ball joints retaining nut."
There are two styles that you may possibly run across.
This one has what you'd call a through bolt.
"As you can see on the ball joints stud, there's a grove."
"The retaining bolt runs through that grove, something?s similar like this and clamps down and keeps the ball joint from coming off."
The other style you may run across is that the ball joint will be threaded on top and then actually a large nut will go down on top of it and hold it in place.
"Due to room constraints on front wheel drive vehicles, almost nine times out of ten, it will have a through bolt."
That eliminates the need for the stud to be bigger and having a large nut on it.
"Generally on pickup trucks, light trucks, and things of that nature, you will see the threads on the top."
So pay attention to that.
The nut and bolt is located right down here.
As you can see.
What I'm going to do is put an opened end wrench on the nut for bolt.
And use my three inch ratchet with the socket on the other side.
"You can see how I set my wrench on there using the spindle to actually hold it for me, so"
I can use both hands on the ball joints containing bolt.
And there you go.
"It may be necessary, just depending on how corroded it is, to actually have to screw the bolt out of its location."
"You can see, as I'm turning it the bolt is beginning to come out."

PROFESSOR:
Last time we were talking about binary search and
I sort of left a promise to you which I need to pick up.
"I want to remind you, we were talking about search, which is a very fundamental thing that we do in a whole lot of applications."
"The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago, and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits."
This is Riversleigh.
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
We found marsupial lions.
We found carnivorous kangaroos.
"It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo, but these are meat-eating kangaroos."
"We found the biggest bird in the world, bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar, and it too was a flesh eater."
"It was a giant, weird duck."
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
"You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing, sitting in a pool of water."
These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
"We had, in Australia, drop crocs."
They really do exist.
(Laughter)
But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines.
"There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests, and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua."
"Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag, until a drop croc landed on her."
"At any rate, it was a fascinating place, but unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way."
"Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time, and gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out, and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline, until by five million years ago, only one left."
"By 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea, and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog -- into Australia."
"And as you can see, dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines."
That similarity meant they probably competed.
They were eating the same kinds of foods.
"It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets, and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival."
"All we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in, thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland, and after that they only survived in Tasmania."
"Then, unfortunately, the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788, and they brought with them the things they valued, and that included sheep."
"They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania, and they thought, hang on, this is not going to work."
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.
"That was not what happened, actually."
"Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap."
"But immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them, and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw."
"By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered."
In fact there is research on CEOs.
"CEOs tend to be tall and attractive, and that's just not fair is it?"
But that's just status; that's having an effect on decisions that are made in cooperations.
Age.
Sometimes we don't look with as much respect on people who are older or younger.
We see them as immature or maybe out of date.
"And so these are some status variables that affect groups, and hopefully, that isn't going to be a factor that prevents those variables from people from contributing in an equal way."
"Now, we're going to talk about attained status next."
Ascribed status is somethings you bring into the room.
When you come into that meeting you bring it with you.
"You have your clothes on; you have your job, your economic status."
"It's all already in your past, but attained status is different."
It's something you build.
It's something you actually develop in the group itself once the meetings start.
"So we're going to call this more of a internal type of status that maybe you do some really neat things for the group, and you help them solve problem."
"Everybody's proud of you, and you're a hero in your group."
"You've done some amazing stuff, and so now you have high attained status."
"People almost want to start listening to your ideas because you were the one who worked through the last situation, successfully."
"Or maybe of low status because you had this idea, and the group went with it, and it didn't work very well."
And now we've got to go back and fix that a little bit.
"Well, you've lost some status; you're credibility is a little lower now."
"So, that's what we call attained status."
We'll be paying attention to that in this course.
The third thing we're going to look at is power.
And I think if you're in the work place you know that you have to be able to use power in a healthy way.
So we're going to talk about some of these types of power.
"And when we look at this type of power, we have things like legitimate power."
"Now, legitimate power is power that you're given by being chosen, and you actually have, you've been given the assignment to be in charge of a group."
Another one of these is what we call referent power.
"Now, I want to you to pay special attention to referent power."
Put an asterisk next to that one.
"That is actually the ideal form of power, if you can have referent power and use referent power."
In that one we would go and check to make sure that the M characters match if we have a hash match.
And then if it could be that with such at a low probability could be that there's a hash match but not a substring match.
Then we're just.
Move on.
And from a theoretical point of view there's some very extremely low possibility that one could be slow.
But lets look over at what the analysis says.
So the theory says that if you take a sufficiently large random prime say mn^ three So a long value maybe you can get that and remember n is huge.
"Then the probability of a false collision is about 1/n. so you know in a billion things you might get, you might get 1/n, you might get a false collision."
"So in practice we choose actually q just to be, there's no reason not to choose as"
"large as we possibly can, not related to m and n.m And then the probably collision is going to be about 1/q."
"So we're going to take it to be like the biggest law, and that means that probably collision is extremely small."
And then you can take your chances.
You can do a Monte Carlo version where you just say I got a match because I got a hash match.
And be confident in the laws of probability.
And not worry about the client getting the wrong answer.
"Or you can have the Las Vegas version where you go, go ahead and return the correct answer."
And.
"And be confident that your client's not gonna run into a slow case cuz the probability is so, so tiny, 1/q, that you don't have to worry about it."
That's the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
"Now, why look at this algorithm?"
It's linear time.
We have other algorithms that are linear time.
"One of the key reasons to, be interested in Rabin-Karp is that it's easy to extend it to more complicated situations."
"So, say you wanna look for one of, several different patterns."
"Well, you just compute the hatches for those patterns, and then look for any one them Use, a symbol table, to look for'em."
"So, that's a much more, general capability than, we can provide with the other methods."
It also can be extended to do 2-dimensional search and other things like that.
"For straight suffering search, it's gonna be a little slower because, there's, interloop it's kind of long, the arithmatic operation, are gonna be a"
"little slow, if you wanna do the Las Vegas version you have to back up the text and you have this, Monte Carlo Las, Las Vegas thing, and you should think about, writing code to extend it to look for any one of p possible patterns, thats, an interesting,"
Algorithmic puzzle as I mentioned is not so difficult to solve.
So here's our summary.
"We started with a brute force algorithm, and although typically you don't have this worst case thing."
And we know from the other property of linear transformations that the transformation of a vector multiplied by the scalar is the same thing as the scalar multiplied by the transformation of the vector.
That's just from our definition of linear transformations.
Plus x2 two times the transformation of e2 plus all the way to xn times the transformation of en.
"Now, what is this?"
"I could rewrite this, so everything I've done so far, so the transformation of x is equal to that, which just using our properties of linear transformations, all linear transformations, this has to be true for them."
I get to this and this is equivalent.
"This is equal to-- if we view each of these as a column vector, this is equal to what?"
"This is equal to the matrix where this is the first column, T e1."
And then the second column is T e2.
"And then we go all the way to T en times-- let me put it this way-- x1, x2, all the way to xn."
"We've seen this multiple, multiple times."
"Now what's really, really, really neat about this is I just started with an arbitrary transformation."
"And I just showed that an arbitrary linear transformation of x can be rewritten as a product of a matrix where I'm taking that same linear transformation of each of our standard basis vectors, and I can construct that matrix, and multiplying that matrix times my x vector is the same thing as this transformation."
So this is essentially showing you that all transformations--
let me be careful.
All linear transformations can be a matrix vector product.
"Not only did I show you that you can do it, but it's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do."
This is actually a pretty simple operation to do.
Let me show you an example.
"I don't know, I think this is super neat."
Let's say that I just-- I'm just going to make up some transformation.
Let's say I have a transformation and it's a mapping between-- let's make it extra interesting-- between R2 and R3.
"And let's say my transformation, let's say that"
"T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's say the first entry is x1 plus 3x2, the second entry is 5x2 minus x1, and let's say the third entry is 4x1 plus x2."
This is a mapping.
I could have written it like this.
"I could write T of any vector in R2, x1, x2, is equal to-- and maybe this is just redundant, but I think you get the idea."
"I like this notation better. x1 plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and then 4x1 plus x2."
This statement and this statement I just wrote are equivalent.
And I like to visualize this a little bit more.
"Now, I just told you that I can represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
How do I do it?
Call that an understatement.
In a piece for The Washington Post
"Jamila Bey calls Limbaugh's words — ""hate speech."""
"""What Limbaugh did - and does frequently - is ""slut-shaming"" and it's no less hateful and derogatory than racial slurs."""
Democrats are calling on leaders of the GOP to condemn Limbaugh's comments.
But on MSNBC — a political science professor says she hopes they don't so voters can see what the party is actually about.
26% of voters in the election in 2008 were single women.
"So they decided the outcome of the election, and they may well do it again if Republicans keep promoting this hateful dialogue."""
But Limbaugh's point about mandating coverage is one that continues to have support within the GOP.
As Mona Charen writes for the conservative National Review.
"""Democrats come along and force insurance companies to provide for free something that 95 percent of people have been purchasing, and when we object, they scream that we want to ""send women back"""
"It's ludicrous and dishonest and manipulative."""
"House Speaker John Boehner did condemn the comments — calling them ""inappropriate."""
"And Politico reports , Friday President Obama himself called Fluke to thank her for speaking out."
This is by no means Limbaugh's first brush with controversy.
"But this time, The Atlantic Wire reports — advertisers are distancing themselves from the war of words."
"Still others note, Limbaugh's brand of runaway rhetoric can't do much to help the cause."
The Christian Science Monitor's Peter Grier asks — has he gone too far this time?
"""In pouring gasoline on a subject that was already a propane fire, he may have drawn attention to himself. but it's possible he's singeing Republicans who are standing close to the action."""
Fluke herself has responded to Limbaugh's comments — calling them outside the bounds of civil discourse.
"I was convinced as i have been told that I would be protecting civilians against armed gangs, Algerian snipers.."
"And then I saw that these people are from Yefren like us, Libyans, brothers and real men (brave)."
I appeal to stop the bloodshed in all of Libya land and I hope that will come true.
We have been told that these people are not libyans.
And that there are also Algerian snipers.We were attacked and we surrendered to them and told them we are all Libyans.
"They are not Algerians sniper, nor foreigners - only Libyans."
"We didn't find mercenaires as we had been told, only Libyans from Yefren, and frankly we found none of what we been told."
What I hope is that all this bloodshed will stop.
Let's look at some examples of gamification for social good.
"They're in four categories, health and wellness."
Energy and environment.
Education and government.
It came out of Netscape.
Netscape at one time had been the almost monopoly browser vendor.
"It was the first commercial browser, so we had, I don't know, 99% of the market share at one time."
And it was a pretty exciting time.
That was when the Internet and the Web actually really exploded.
Microsoft appeared.
They started building its own browser.
Microsoft did a couple of things that ended up eventually building a good browser.
And it also engaged in a whole range of illegal activities.
And so the combination of that changed the landscape drammatically.
And Netscape management had the foresight to recognise they could not continue and be successful in the way they had been operating.
And they realised with the help of the engineering folk set at Netscape that the best opportunity was to convert their typical proprietary closed commercial product into an open source product.
This was radical in its day.
"Open source is mainstream now, but it was not then."
"Open source was deep in the technical community, it never surfaced in a product, it was all sort of odd and it was a very radical move."
"The second thing that happened is that the management team,"
"I was there at the time, a lot of us were, but I was part of these discussions, realised that an open source project had to be real."
"So, inside Netscape there was created a small group of people who were charged with the job of building a successful open source project."
"And there was a larger group of people, engineering, that was charged with building a successful Netscape product."
"That Netscape product was designed to make money for Netscape and ultimately money for AOL, after AOL bought Netscape."
"So, in the very early days of Mozilla, through '98, '99, 2000, we had these two different groups."
"We had the engineering group, which was a 100-150 people working on building the Netscape navigator product managed by a set of people wanting to use that product to make money for AOL."
"Then we had the small group of people who were charged with building Mozilla as an open source project, building contributors from all sorts of different places and building a technology base that was useful for many different companies."
The open source side.
That was small in name.
There were six or eight of us.
"Of those, Mick was one of them,"
"Gerv was one of them,"
"Dan was one of them,"
"Brendan was one of them,"
"I was one of them,"
Shaver was one of them and there was a few of other folks who aren't here any longer.
But I like to do it because I think it'll give you the intuition on what's going on when we take our surface integrals.
"So I'm going to say that this whole thing right here, that that is equal to r of s plus the differential of s-- a super small change in s-- t minus r of s and t, all of that over that same super small change in s."
So hopefully you understand at least why I view things this way.
"When I take the limit as delta s approaches 0, these delta s's are going to get super duper duper small."
"And in my head, that's how I imagine differentials."
When someone writes the derivative of y with respect to x-- and let's say that they say that that is 2-- and we've done a little bit of math with differentials before.
"You can imagine multiplying both sides by dx, and you could get dy is equal to 2dx."
We've done this throughout calculus.
"The way I imagine it is super small change in y-- infinitely small change in y-- is equal to 2 times-- though, you can imagine an equally small change in x."
"So it's a-- well, if you have a super small change in x, your change in y is going to be still super small, but it's going to be 2 times that."
I guess that's the best way to view it.
"But in general, I view differentials as super small changes in a variable."
"So with that out of the way, and me explaining to you that many mathematicians would cringe at what I just wrote, hopefully this gives you a little-- this isn't like some crazy thing I did."
"I'm just saying, oh, delta s as delta approaches 0, I kind of imagine that as ds."
"And the whole reason I did that, is if you take this side and that side, and multiply both sides times this differential ds, then what happens?"
"The left hand side, you get the partial of r with respect to s is equal to this times ds."
I'll do ds in maybe pink.
"Times ds-- this is just a regular differential, super small change in s."
"This is a kind of a partial, with respect to s."
"That's going to be equal to-- well, if you multiply this side of the equation times ds, this guy's going to disappear."
"So it's going to be r of s, plus our super small change in s, t minus r of s and t."
Now let me put a little square around this.
This is going to be valuable for us in the next video.
We're going to actually think about what this means and how to visualize this on a surface.
"As you can imagine, this is a vector right here."
You have 2 vector valued functions and you're taking the difference.
And we're going to visualize it in the next video.
It's going to really help us with surface integrals.
"By the same exact logic, we can do everything we did here with s, we can do it with t, as well."
"So we can define the partial-- I'll draw a little-- I can define the partial of r with respect-- let me do it in a different color, completely different color."
It's orange.
The partial of r with respect to t-- the definition is just right here.
You can't say it's a bad thing.
"Even if you don't agree with the 15M, if you put someone who has nothing to do with the 15M in front of 4 people and say ""you're going to laugh"", in the end you get caught up in it, emotionally, through humour."
I think that's really important.
There are a lot of people who I believe were hooked on the 15M because it's fun.
And it has been fun.
"I don't know if it still is for everyone, but for a lot of people it has been fun. and the use of false identities, which is another debate altogether, has also contributed to get certain absurd examples of behaviour out of the furrows."
People who pretend to be someone else and talk to other Twitter users who react in a really absurd way.
So absurd it's real.
And that serves to expose certain things.
Undoubtedly it's the most original political action there is.
But it's just the beginning.
I think it's always going to be that original from now on.
"The large protests are going to be like that via the networks, with sarcasm, with a sense of humour where the individual is above political affiliation."
I think all that can be used by completely opposing ideologies.
"And we're simply at the start of a new form of political participation, to achieve the most diverse goals."
"Not just with goals that, for example 73% of the population can empathise with, but anything that goes beyong political parties and NGOs, it can be organised through the net."
ST:
Let's wrap this up.
"Out of everything that's happened, what do you think has been the most important thing?"
JL:
I think there has been a change in the mentality of society.
Vital attitude.
A door to participation in politics of the future has opened.
A way of allowing people to participate publicly from here on in.
"Not just because of the protests and the assemblies, but because of what's happening on the internet."
I think it's become obvious that a lot of people organised spontaneously and very suddenly- I mean we're organised today for this and tomorrow I don't need to know you- can impose the political agenda of a country.
Almost nothing.
"And I think it's also going to serve as an experience of political maturity for a lot of people, this has been their first political experience."
"Young people, and not so young people who have had their first political experience, and are learning a lot about this world, regarding the media, politics, team work."
Good lessons and bad lessons.
And how this atmosphere of maturity is going to evolve is quite eye-catching.
"Because if there are people who think the 15M is naive, maybe their strength is non confrontation,"
The College of Arts and Sciences attracts faculty from around America and the world.
"Individually, they bring many unique and fresh perspectives, but they all share something in common: a love for Alaska and a passion to teach and inspire."
Steven Johnson:
"You know, we get obsessed with things and we pursue them rabidly and that's a good thing when it comes to knowledge, and discovery and teaching."
"That's good, and that's what you want."
Dr. Jocelyn Krebs:
Undergraduate research is a great opportunity that students have at UAA.
"It can be very challenging to do, especially at large schools, and we create a lot of opportunities here and it's really essential for students that want to go on to medical school, go on to graduate school. and really for anyone that wants to be able to think critically about the world"
Chris Barnett:
"You know, I get to be here in the setting of Alaska and still be able to do the biomedical research"
I previously didn't think was available.
I think it's the best of both worlds for me.
Steven Johnson:
"We have grown as a university in just ways, that other, older institutions couldn't even comprehend."
We have created an environment where students can thrive.
Hillary Jochens:
The attention that I get from faculty and small class sizes and the research opportunities have been remarkable.
Steven Johnson:
The students that we are turning out are extraordinarily good students.

[Amy Goodman]
I want to go back to that moment when Mitt Romney made his entrance on Thursday night.
"He walked down the aisle of the Republican convention, and as he was passing the New York delegation, he shook the hand of the state Republican Party chair, Ed Cox, and then he shook hands with David Koch, actually put his hand on his shoulder, pointed at him, and then shook his hand."
"While [Democracy Now!] was there on the floor, we captured the handshake on video."
"The pool feed that went out, that the networks broadcast, cut away just before the handshake, showing two enthusiastic young women supporters, and then an overhead shot of the convention center."
Then the shot comes back to Romney further down the aisle. shaking hands as he ascended the stage.
And we show that split screen.
"For our radio listeners, you can go to democracynow.org."
"I think it's an interesting metaphor for the money behind the scenes, not highlighted even by the media."
Medea?
[Medea Benjamin]
"Well I think in the last--past conventions, you'd see it more overtly: they'd be giving out the bags, would have the corporate logos on them, and it would be so easy to know who is [sic] the sponsors."
The people just run the machines.
So it's much more efficient to have to do it through more machines and less through more workers in automobile production.
"So in that case you could have a steeper expansion path, where basically the marginal product of labor is falling relative to the marginal product of capital, so you want to increase the ratio of capital to labor over time."
"The bottom line is as firms produce more, they may hold constant or may change the ratio of their inputs, but they'll clearly use more inputs."
"They're going to use more inputs, but the mix of the inputs they'll use will change with their production levels."
"So the question we have to ask is, well, what's going to determine their production level?"
Where does q come from?
I'll have to leave that as a teaser for next time.
"Let me just say where q comes from, is q is going to come from market competition."
We're going to get q--
"I'm not done, I have one more thing to cover."
But we're going to get q from market competition.
Now there is one other thing I want to cover though related to costs.
"Which is an important concept that we have to have in the back of our mind, which when we come back, we think about competition."
Which is fixed versus sunk cost.
"Fixed-- my wife always thought I was saying some costs, I'm not."
I'm saying sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed even in the long-run.
"Fixed costs are costs which are fixed in the short-run, and variable in the long-run, so capital."
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed in the long-run.
"That is, they're foregone once you produce."
"The minute you produce one unit, those sunk costs are gone forever, and they cannot be changed even in the long-run."
"In other words, importantly, they cannot be changed by how much you produce."
"So in the long-run, you can change the cost of capital by building bigger or smaller plants, producing more or less."
But some costs cannot be changed.
So what's a classic example?
"Well, the classic example for example would be medical education, or any professional education."
"Once you've gone to med school and done all your grueling years of staying up all night, you've paid those costs."
"They're now paid for, and it doesn't matter if you see three patients the rest of your life or three million patients the rest of your life, you've already paid those costs."
Think of that as the capital of a doctor's office.
"Somebody asked, ""What's special about special relativity, and what's general about general relativity?"""
How do they relate?
"So, we'll come back to that one."
"Somebody also asked,"
"""Why use the speed of light to convert time into space and vice versa, to get them in the same coordinate system?"""
"So, why use c to convert time to space and vice versa?"
"And then, also, there was the question of, you know, ""What is the mathematical formulation of general relativity?"""
"So, how to express general relativity in some kind of equation."
"And we'll get to the key equation, which is something called a metric, for general relativity, and then we're going to stop."
Because to go on from there is fairly heavy calculus and we're just not going to do that.
But I want to get at least that far.
"Okay, so let's go back to special relativity for a minute."
"So, special relativity."
"Flat space-time, no gravity."
And you'll recall what happens.
"As you get close to the speed of light, all sorts of things that you thought were kind of constant and properties of objects,"
"like mass and length and duration, and duration of time, and things like that, all start to get weird and change."
"So, length, time, mass, all these things, vary with the velocity of the person doing the measuring."
"And so, you could ask the question, is there anything that doesn't vary?"
Is there anything that's an invariant?
"And the answer is, yes."
There are some things that don't vary.
"So, some things are invariant."
"And Einstein actually said later in his career that it's actually the invariants that are important, not the things that change."
"And so, he should have called his theory invariant theory instead of relativity theory."
Think of what that would have done to pop philosophy.
"Instead of saying, ""everything is relative,"" all this stuff, you would have had the exact same theory."
You would have called it invariance theory.
"And the pop philosophy interpretation of this would be,"
"""some things never change."""
And it would have been a whole different concept in three in the morning dorm room conversations.
"Okay, so some things are invariant, what things?"
"But despite these limitations, Wiki has been, Wikipedia has been extremely powerful in certain fields like medicine the Wikipedia entries are extremely well documented."
So now we have to look at some of the underlying reasons.
Okay.
Including forming consensus on conscientious articles.
Among a community of possibly anonymous contributors.
One way to look at the challenge of consensus formation is to look at the order of growth.
"For example, if we look at."
A network.
With many nodes and many links.
We often say that there is a network effect.
"And a positive one, where something good Gross."
As the square of the number of nodes and okay the something good for example could be the utility of the presence of a node.
Now this implicitly assumes that every node is linked to every other node.
Or at least the number of links a node has growth linearly.
As N.
"So we'll later come back to this positive network effect, this n-square law, in various lectures."
But today we'll also look at the complementary picture that is two to the n law.
Suppose each one of these n nodes is just a binary state of mind.
"For example, do I support a certain political position or do I not support?"
"Then out of N, knows that two to the N possibilities of configurations."
And yet we would like to reach a consensus.
This exponential growth two to the n in the number of people in the crowd or network highlights the difficulty of reaching consensus.
There're just too many possibilities.
"And yet, consensus we must reach, and what"
Wikipedia practice is what they call the good faith collaboration.
There are rules and guidelines.
There are mechanisms .
For encouraging collaboration.
"Consensus formation is one huge challenge, there are also three related challenges, one is that it is free."
"So how can something free, work in later lectures."
"And in fact in the first two lectures of this course, we say how pricing"
Information played a very important role in providing the right incentives.
"It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall."
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
"It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species."
"These are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin, who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart."
"To add insult to injury, having swept this species nearly off the table, this animal, when it died of neglect --"
The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
"It died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin, they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump."
Does it have to stay this way?
"In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum."
I was fascinated by thylacines.
I've always been obsessed with these animals.
"And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old."
"The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol."
"I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative."
"But this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends, couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA, if it's there, and then somewhere down the line in the future, we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?"
The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly.
Cloning was science fiction.
It had not happened.
But then suddenly cloning did happen.
"And I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,"
I'm going to give this a go.
I put a team together.
"We went into that pup to see what was in it, and we did find thylacine DNA."
It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited.
"Unfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA."
"Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen, put their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,"
"""Wow, look at that,"" plop, dropped it back in the jar, contaminating this specimen."
And that was a worry.
"If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back, what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed, was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine."
"It would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy."
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media attending the Design Enabling
Economies and Policies conference hosted by OCAD and G3ict.
This two-day think tank will examine new strategies in digital inclusion beyond current approaches.
"Axel Leblois, President and Executive Director of the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies."
Or G3ict for short.
AXEL:
"As you know, there was a significant milestone back in 2006, when the United Nations General Assembly actually passed the text of the"
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
"Which today, has been signed by 153 countries and ratified by 104."
"Which means, in the short part of time, that Convention has established itself worldwide as the global legal framework to protect the rights of persons with disabilities."
KELLY:
The conference had guest speakers that addressed the crowd.
"Jutta Treviranus,"
Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University.
So the Inclusive Design Institute is a regional research hub with many postsecondary partners;
"Eight, in fact, all in the greater Toronto area."
"And partnerships with collaborating private sector organizations and community organizations, all working together to try to ensure that the emerging technologies that we all depend upon become accessible to the full diversity"
That is the users within our community.
KELLY:
A joystick plugged into an interface allows the user to move the cursor around on a mobile phone.
Three press-buttons connected to an interface allow the user to perform the same functions on a tablet.
"So there's a central facility here at OCAD University that includes actually 9 labs, with various functions."
And it's spread over 3 buildings.
"But, in additions to that, there are satellite facilities at the 8 other academic institutions as well."
KELLY:
Attending the first DEEP conference
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media.
"Now, what does this continue command actually do?"
What happens if we set a stepping variable to false?
"Is it the program resumes until it exits, the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached, the program resumes until the next function is called, or does the program stay in the same line?"
Keep in mind that all of these options assume that we return true in our program.
(whispering) Hi!
5 times F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is the same thing as 5 times m0.
Draw a line here.
So we have a new relationship.
5m0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
"All I did is I substituted this for this, or this for that."
"And I used this relationship, which we got in the beginning to do that."
And now what do we have?
We have 5 m sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
We could subtract m0 from both sides.
You get 4 m0 is equal to m1.
You could divide both sides by m0 and you got 4 is equal to m1 over m0.
And you could invert this relationship and you can get m0 over m sub 1 is equal to 1/4.
So what we learned is the ratio of the old mass to the new mass is 1 to 4.
And that's a problem.
"And actually, I will leave it for you as an exercise to figure out-- to just do the same problem using the numbers."
"I will do that actually, in the next video just to show you that that actually would've been a simpler way to do it."
But it's good to get used to this just so you can solve things in general terms.
I'll see you in the next video.
Brad Penney:
More on Steve and the Race to The Top Initiative that he will be talking about when Steve formally joins the Webinar and is introduced.
"And I'm also very pleased that my colleagues Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations here at NASCSP, and Mark Schmeissing, who is the acting"
"Research Director for CSBG, will be giving presentations, and we are also going to be hearing from Bob Scott and others who are on the line as resources."
Bob is the Energy Services Director and a great resource on all things weatherization.
"So, with that we'll get into the content of the webinar, and as everyone knows, the President did submit the $3.8 Trillion budget last week for FY ""14."
"That represents about a 1% cut adjusted for inflation over the preceding year budget, and it was submitted two months late because of all of the difficulties which we will get into later in the webinar with the Continuing Resolution, the personnel changes at OMB, uncertainty over the debt ceiling and how other changes would factor in, that's the reason that it was two months late."
"The good thing from the standpoint of the Department of Energy, just to begin to deal with weatherization issues first, is the DOE did receive a very healthy increase of 8% over the Fiscal Year ""12 ask, and the increase, if it's enacted, will bring the Department of Energy Budget up to $28.4 billion."
"So that would be a reflection of the President's commitment to clean energy, and we regard that as a very, very positive sign in terms of the President's priorities."
Please go to the next slide.
"So hopefully you're looking at a slide that says ""What Do the Numbers Mean for the Weatherization Program""."
"And as I said there is an 8% increase in the Department of Energy Budget in the 2014 ask and for the energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is where weatherization resides in the budget."
"A 62% proposed increase taking the EERE budget up to $2.8 billion if this is enacted for Fiscal Year ""14, which will start on October 1 of this year."
"Among the big winners: building technologies, advanced manufacturing, and clean vehicles."
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

"Hello, our final lecture on, Alzheimer's disease, is going to talk about animal models, and bio-markers, and therapeutic approaches, to Alzheimer's disease."
"Experimenters, in modern neuro science, have a series of, animal models, for"
Alzheimer's disease.
"Especially mice, especially mice that over produce, a p, p, amyloid, precursor protein."
And other mice that have mutations in pre-senilens.
Again especially with Alzheimer's disease associated mutations.
So there is some progress.
"And the, challenge, is to make, data from mice, relevant to those with people."
"Now, in general, what does one want to do, for Alzheimer's disease."
"Well, as for Parkinson's disease, which we'll discuss in the, next series, you would"
"like, to do two things, for Alzheimer's."
You would like to find a person with early stage Alzheimer's.
And stop that early stage Alzheimer's from progressing any further.
"So if a naive user, a naive human, is not from Canada, he might not know how to spell Scatchwood."
"If a person is not know from New York, he might not know how to pronounce ""Schenectady, New York"""
And I'm not really sure I'm pronouncing it right either.
(audience chuckles) but this edge really makes the difference.
"So, why is that a problem for us?"
Humans regain the wake.
Franz just mentioned that the human evaluations switch volumes in translation.
It's the same thing in speech recognition.
"The ground truth, the standard, the golden rule- the golden standard for speech recognition is human performance."
We have humans transcribing these speech recognition and that's what we benchmark ourselves against.
"And if the benchmark is barely better than the actual system, then we really have a problem."
"The other issue is that, with the kind of growth that we've seen in terms of usage, we are getting a ton of data flowing throughout the system."
Everyday we get about 2 years worth of data.
You can't even start thinking about transcribing all that.
We also have to support 27 languages.
"Internationalization is a big, big empahsis for us and we're trying to expand in all the languages of the world."
"So, I'm joking here but we're sort of-"
Fred Jilinek is a very famous person in speech recognition.
"He used to say that every time he fired a linguist, the performance rate improved."
(audience chuckles)
I want to fire all the humans.
"So, the key insight for us has been- speech recognition as I said is two different components and those two components try to, sort of, compensate for the deficiencies of each other."
So the acoustic model can compensate for the deficiency of the language model and vice versa.
"The traditional way of doing it is that you have the Truth that's set by a human transcriber, that's the gold standard."
And you benchmark your system against the truth.
You compare your best system against the truth and you try to PUSH it. and learn towards that goal.
"If you remove the truth, you are out of luck."
You don't have anything that you can compare against.
"The trick here for us is that we can actually cheat, and we can artificially make it harder for some parts of our system to function."
We can actually weaken parts of our system.
"So for example, if I weaken my language model then I suddenly have a system that's actually. . ."
less powerful and I can compare against the best system.
Workers can't just negotiate for their rights.
Striking is the best way to get their rights.
And I'll repeat again: negotiators must be elected so they don't betray the interests of the workers.
"We are 45,000 workers in the Public Transport Authority."
We have an independent union.
The independent union called us to join a strike
"The union said that workers had the right to social justice, to a minimum wage and to a decent pension."
The union said we must strike for the sake of our kids.
It's the same thing all over the world and not just in Egypt or in England.
"Ordinary people shouldn't be working to feed the rich, they should be working to feed their own families."
The rich just sit around at home getting richer.
They control the government.
"The capitalists"" control of the government is what loses workers their rights."
That is why workers all over the world must win their rights.
"I'd like to ask colleagues in London, how long before you rise up?"
You need to get the young people organised.
The time for waiting has passed.
The workers of London need to strike and fight back for their rights.
"They need to fight for the rights of pensioners, who can't win their rights themselves anymore."
"So I'm asking the workers of London, and the workers of the world to be like Che Guevara, and like Lech Walesa in Poland, to be like the workers of Egypt who changed the course of history with the revolution of 25 January and who overthrew the tyrant."
You should overthrow your tyrants in London.
"In a factory or in a public institution if there are only 5 independent worker activists but they have the confidence of their colleagues, then they can lead 5,000 others."
Each one can move a thousand.
"So I say, anywhere there are five activists like this, they can get people to move by telling them ""these are your rights and you must take them"", by showing how the rich are robbing the poor how globalisation is controlling people, and how wealth is going to a small handful, while people are dying of hunger in places like Somalia."
"I urge workers in Britain to make a revolution, because Britain is a great country."
"We love Britain because there is freedom there, and we had no freedom in Egypt."
Despite this we still had a revolution and overthrew a million policemen.
So can't you overthrow however many policemen you have?
You are the poor and yet you're working to make the rich richer.
You are the heroes of Britain.
You're the new generation of heroes
I call on the workers of London to lead the workers of the world in a revolution to overthrow tyranny in every country and get the poor their rights.
"But generally speaking it's the organisms in a particular place, plus the physical and chemical environment with which they're interacting."
And it's often a local example of some kind of biome.
Okay?
"So it could be a local chunk of tundra, a local chunk of rainforest, a pond."
It could be an upwelling area off Peru.
It could be an alpine forest.
It could be a lot of different things.
"And people study how energy flows, and so the paradigm basically, at least for things that are in the part of the planet that are driven by the primary productivity of plants, it starts with photosynthesis, and the annual production is usually determined by temperature and moisture; certainly for terrestrial ecosystems."
"Left out of this description is all of the chemosynthetic activity which occurs in deep, black, dark water at mid-ocean ridges, and which is occurring in the subterranean part of the biosphere that goes down- up to say five or ten kilometers, where there are bacteria that are living deep in the ground."
"And actually the pervasive influx of life, into the subterranean environment, is an important part in the biogeochemistry of the planet; that's not covered here."
"If we look around by, just by surface area, the planet's about 65% open ocean; it's about 5% continental shelf; desert's about 5%--that's extreme desert, okay, that's just about nothing on the surface; semidesert, so Sahel, that kind of area, about almost 3½, 4%; 3% tropical rainforest; and so forth."
"The idea here is you can take the planet and you can define different categories of the way things live on it, just by surface area, and break it down, and it looks like this."
"So here, if you were just to look at that, you would say, ""Well, open ocean, continental shelf, desert and rainforest are the main biomes on the planet."""
That's just by surface area.
"If you look at net primary production per square meter, you get a totally different view."
Okay?
"So this is just by surface area, and this is by primary production per square meter."
Look at how lousy the open oceans are.
Open oceans are deserts.
Why are open oceans deserts?
Student:
No fresh water.
Prof:
What?
Student:
No fresh water.
Prof:
"No, it's not that there's no fresh water."
What do you need if you're going to make an ecosystem productive?
Student:
Zooplankton &amp;gt;.
Prof:
"What I mean by that is that, a student can start here, do the first two years of university education, and then move on for the third and fourth year at the university, attain the bachelor's degree."
Most community colleges have articulation agreements with these institutions.
So it's a seamless process.
And it's the same degree in the end.
"The difference, however, is to the international students' advantage."
"Because you get the associate degree in the first two years, and you have a year of optional practical training available to you."
"You get the second degree, the bachelor's degree, and you have another year of optional practical training."
"So two work permits, you might say, for two whole years in the United States."
"That student, with that language ability and experience with the education, going back to their homeland for work has terrific opportunities that the student that stayed will never have."
So that's one of many.
"The other, of course, is the value proposition."
They are much less expensive.
"NOVA is 1/3 the price of the nearest university, which is a very good one."
And that's probably the least expensive of the universities around.
So already we're talking about one whole third of the tuition price.
"A community college has smaller classes, teachers that are not preoccupied with research."
"They are engaged with the student, one-on-one most of the time."
There are supportive student services that help the students adapt to the United States.
"And writing centers and tutors, all which are free here, are what the student can use to kind of help with their studies."
"So you've got student clubs, as well, associations, so forth, that the student can, here, become a better-prepared university student while they're at the community college, all for less expense."
So that's just part of the picture.
But I think it's an important part.
PATRlCIA GORDON:
We have international student counselors.
They're available for them throughout their two years or if they're here longer.
We have a career counselor.
And we have a transfer counselor.
"And all the faculty, really, are available."
That's the uniqueness of a community college.
The classrooms are small.
The faculty are available.
"Students writing essays to transfer to four-year schools, faculty, staff, counselors are all available to advise them, review their essays."
"That is this treachery, the hipocracy, we are to avoid."
Imitation side.
Which is not proper and is going in the name of proper.
"That is dangerous, we must, we are to avoid that."
We are to come in connection with the truth.
With the reality.
Unto [dim??] also ready.
"Not any [passinarly??], imitationary."
"Our dealing will be sincere, true, and we must come in touch with the truth."
The thruthful result we may expect.
Truth is independent.
It is not subservient to anything else.
We shall have to come in connection with truth anyhow.

UK Youth Parliament Make Your Mark 2012
Want to have a voice?
Want to have a say?
Want to Make Your Mark?
The UK Youth Parliament is coming together to fight your corner and tackle the biggest issues facing young people today.
But we need your help
Run by young people for young people the UK youth parliament gives opportunities to 11 - 18 year olds to use their voice to have an influence on the decisions which affect them members are elected up and down the country by you to represent you its not about party politics its about campaigning on the issues which matter to you this November members of youth parliament are going to take over the house of commons who chooses the issues to be debated?
Simple.
You
Last year the UK youth parliament carried out a nationwide pole of over 65 thousand young people and you told us what your top 5 issues were across the country.
Too often it seems to me that we are happily accepted as adults
When it comes to parting with our pounds but treated like kids when it comes to having our say in matters that affect us
The cost of public transport is forever rising and it's unreliable
It costs me £16 a week to get to work and twice this week i've been late because of public transport and that is catching two buses that are earlier than i need
If we're expected to use public transport and lower emissions then we should be able to afford it
lowering costs of transport would also make it more accessible to people who are poor
Members of the UK youth parliament have been debating voting on which of these top 5 issues will become a priority campaign for the coming year
Make public transport cheaper better and accessible for all was a national campaign for the previous year
They get a date with a guy that we have a crush on.
And the flipside is that we are always doing things that make other people upset.
Even if we don't realize doing it.
It's very easy to make someone else mad.
Helping some people can hurt others.
I was trying to be very helpful in the Zande village by sowing dresses for friends.
Who got mad at me?
The local Taylor.
I was taking away his business.
"When I took pictures for ID cards for students in [inaudible] for free, who got mad at me?"
The local photographer.
I was taking away his clients.
My Zande students would never answer questions in class.
They hated any kind of praise.
They didn't want anyone to know what grades they are getting.
They were terribly afraid that they'd make other people mad at them: jealous of them and then that would arouse their jealousy and their witchcraft.
"So with possible witch is all around you, no Zande wants to stand out, be richer, smarter, more beautiful, more successful."
"That causes jealousy and envy, and that can heat up witchcraft and cause bad things to happen."
Neither do Zande want to be poor or unsuccessful or miserable for they then will be accused of being witches and of causing misfortune and others.
Because they'd be the obvious one who would be jealous.
"People who are lucky who have opportunities such as scholarships to study abroad as this young man did, he actually got his PhD at the University of Paris right after I did."
They set themselves up for witchcraft.
"They return home as college professors, businessmen, bureaucrats, they earn good wages, and the next thing you know, they get sick and die."
"Unfortunately, as this young man did."
"People who get good jobs are inundated with requests for help from dozens if not hundreds of family members and help they must or they'll be seen as stingy and selfish, and they'll-- yeah."
And then soon their children will fall ill.
It's a very good system for wealth distribution.
"And it causes many Zande to question the wisdom of getting ahead, for they'll have to share their good fortune so widely that in the end, they won't really be ahead at all."
"In Africa today, the disparity between rich and poor is growing."
Development puts money in the hands of some but leaves others behind.
"So even though education and scientific knowledge is growing, witchcraft accusations are also growing."
"Moreover, whereas traditionally, only mentally competent adults were accused of witchcraft, nowadays, young children and even senile elders are accused and sometimes they're tortured into confessing."
"And to illustrate this,"
"I'd like to talk about  a project called ""Planet Hunters""."
"So Planet Hunters is a project that's been running for a few years now, and we thought we'd try  and discover planets around other stars."
This is the most exciting area of astronomy right now.
We thought there might be a few planets left over for our citizen scientists to catch.
"Now whenever you go hunting planets,  you can't see the planets directly."
What you have to do instead is look for  the indirect signs that they're there.
"And one of the most effective methods  is to look for what we call ""Transits""."
A planet transiting in front of its star will cause the start to dip in brightness  by much less than 1%.
"But if you can catch that dip, then you can infer that the planet is there."
"It's a rather simple case of Dark Matter, if you like."
You can infer that this planet is there from the data.
"And we have data from NASA's Kepler satellite, which is staring -- actually Kepler, I feel rather sorry for it, it's got the most boring job in the world, because it just stares at 150,000 stars, and every 29 minutes tells us what brightness they are."
"It can send that data down here, and we can look for these transits."
And sometimes these transits are really obvious.
( beeping )
"In fact, in this case, they're so obvious that you can hear them."
That modulation is the dip at the repeated transit of a planet orbiting its star in just a few days.
But sometimes the transits aren't so obvious.
"This is what it might just look like to be on a moon, orbiting a Neptune sized world, now know as Planet Hunters 1B."
This was a planet discovered by a group of citizen scientists using our project.
And Planet Hunters 1B is currently a unique world.
It's the only world that we know of  that has 4 suns in its sky.
"So this is a system with 2 pairs of stars, and a planet orbits one of those pairs."
It's a planet that simulations tell us shouldn't exist.
So we didn't even know to look for this and yet there it is.
And it's there because a group of volunteers saw something strange in the data and they didn't even tell us about it.
"They went out, they got more data from the professional NASA website."
"They did their own analysis, and they came to us when  they'd worked out what was going on."
"These were people who did not start off as scientists, who'd gone through the engine of motivation, being convinced that they could do something real by taking part in the main project and then collaborated together to make a truly gobsmacking discovery."
"And then we made the nice image, so that they could try and image  what that planet was like."
This is real citizen science.
This occurred there.
"Because it knows who I am, it knows what I care about and it knows roughly where I am."
"So this notion of autonomous search, the ability to tell me things that I didn't know but I probably am very interested in, is the next great stage in my view of search."
"And ultimately, we think we can understand things like what you really meant."
"So, for example, you ask the question, ""What's the weather like?"" That's the question."
"And what you're really asking is, ""Do I wear a raincoat?"" Right?"
"Or, ""Do I water the plants?"""
"We think we can make that bridge or get closer to it, to understand, ""What did you really mean?"
"What is the problem you're really trying to solve?"" We've also thought a lot about new areas in commerce, specialize searches of one kind and another."
We brought a company called ITA around travel.
"So we're very, very interested in making it possible to answer very deep questions using Computer Science about things that you care about."
"It's interesting that--that one in three queries from smartphones is now from about where I am, where my location is, something around me."
"So, we know that users are doing this and we know they're doing it a lot and it makes sense to them."
"So, the area of mobile--it's interesting that our most mobile search traffic grew 50% in the first half of 2010."
It's growing much quicker than everything else.
"So, not only is--do I believe my strategy is correct here, but also the data says that our users really, really like this."
"It's interesting that Android and I, of course, I hope everybody has their Android phones with them."
"Android is shipping about 200,000 activations per day now, and God knows what the growth rate is going to be."
It's so fast.
"What's interesting about Android, of course, is it's not just one partner."
"There are more than 60 devices and 21 OEM partners across 59 carriers in 49 countries, and that number is growing very, very quickly."
"And you can imagine those numbers will be much, much greater before Christmas because of all the new products that are coming out."
"Search traffic from the Android phones tripled in the first half of 2010, another example of all us taking on."
Another part of this is a browser strategy.
Everybody here knows what browsers are; the things that you use when you are using the Internet?
We have a browser which we like a lot called Chrome.
It's based on an underlying technology called
"WebKit, which is very much the fastest underlying browser technology."
It's used by many of the browsers now and that's part of why it's so quick.
"And in Chrome's case, it's getting--it's got a huge momentum; it now has more than 70 million users."
"It's--the latest release is four times faster, that are really four times faster than the release we did two years ago."
And deeper integration with the browser means that we can have more autonomous actions.
It's exciting because of scale.
"We can bring, and other companies can bring out products that can touch a billion people fairly quickly."
And these markets are
large.
"They're very, very large."
They touch a lot of people.
They touch humanity at it's--in the way it really is as opposed to the way we think--we think of it is.
"But it's terrifying because it's all about information, and ultimately, information is what people care a lot about."
"So we end up, we Google, end up in the middle of most of these debates, whether it's privacy or street view or numerous other issues which people here in the audience know about."
"And from my perspective, I think the debate is healthy."
These are new ideas.
These are new issues.
Society hasn't really decided what to do about some of these things.
"Having the sharing and the opinions of everybody really does help, at least, us inform how we make the decisions of how we go forward with these new products."
"And we encounter this--the scrutiny and we're prepared to participate, and of course, we accept it very much."
"This disruption, this benefit is going to continue."
"It's going to continue from companies like Google and others as well, and the future gets very interesting very quickly."
"This golden era--I talk about the golden era of--or the age of augmented humanity, you can imagine a golden era of breakthroughs."
"The computer science is now driving knowledge in human discipline in all sorts of new ways that can--that we can really solve the scientists' big problems; global warming, terrorism, financial transparency, because these are fundamentally information problems."
"So, imagine a future--this is a very near future that goes something like this: you don't forget anything."
Why?
Because the computer remembers.
You don't have to remember anymore.
The computer remembers.
It remembers the things that you should have remembered but you don't remember anymore because you have too much else going on in your life.
"Computers, in many ways, will become good at what we're not good at, making lists, remembering things, keeping memories and track of all the things going on in our lives."
Humans are just not very good at that.
Computers sort of excel with this sort of thing.
"You're never lost, right?"
"It's funny how, you know, you're always buying maps and worrying about things."
"Now you're never lost, right?"
Your smartphones certainly knows where you are.
"You need the folks in DC who can advocate from their perspective here in Washington, but you also need everyone on the ground and states making phone calls and sending emails to explain what it actually means for that particular state and for communities in that particular state."
You need both.
If you only have one or the other it doesn't quite work out as well.
You really need to work in tandem.
So I appreciate all of Brad and Arley's efforts and everyone on the ground who is helping us make the case.
"Brad: our greatest Appreciation is Senator Reed because, frankly, it has been a lonely struggle these last couple of years."
I don't know if you were on the call earlier but I referred to the difficulties getting out of the gate on the recovery act issues and some of the bad publicity.
There's an amazing success story now to be told about weatherization for one million homes weatherized.
That's where the briefings held on the Hill are so important to tell that very positive story.
"Talk about things that are not frequently mentioned such as the weatherization supply chain, or in Rhode Island or virtually any other state the vendors, the contractors, the suppliers who participate, the manufacturers."
More 95% of the content of products that go into weatherization are manufactured right here in the US.
"There's a story to be told there, and it's a great privilege to work with Senator Reed and your staff in helping to increase the funding for weatherization."
Let's get this program back to the pre-recovery act level of funding so it can really deliver on its promise to help bring energy efficiency to low-income Americans.
Elyse:
"That's our goal, and again I really appreciate everything that everyone here on this call and all of your other colleagues are doing."
Brad:
"Well let us know on the letter, we will help make the maximum effort."
We will reach out to the 225 people who are listening to this right now as well as everyone in our network and work with the other stake holders.
It sounds like you're going to give us a very short turn around.
Elyse:
Unfortunately that's what it's looking like.
I do appreciate you recognizing that and still helping us nonetheless.
Brad:
"We will do it, and we appreciate, knowing how busy your schedule is, taking the time."
Elyse:
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you for inviting me, and again thank you to everyone."
"Everyone has been so helpful, and I just want to keep encouraging that."
Thank you.
Brad:
"Thank you, Elyse, and have a good rest of the afternoon."
"Ok we're going to be joined here momentarily by Steve Capanna from the White House, but I would like to turn it to my colleague, Arley Johnson"
[narrator voice]
"Because the need for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to advocate for themselves is not limited by boundaries, Partners programs are being conducted in most states in the U.S., and a number of foreign countries."
"The individual needs vary, but there are some common themes."
The desire for full inclusion often rises to the top.
I think that the tips and the tools that you learn about advocating for yourself or for others are great.
You can use them for any disability
"Being a blind person, I come against things all the time as far as what I can and can't do because"
I'm blind.
They don't know what I can and can't do because they don't want to give you a chance.
"You have to speak up for yourself, so I learned to be more assertive. speak up for myself and sell myself."
I have to do that.
[narrator voice]
"While many graduates focus on issues of housing and employment, Doug Hedrick has zeroed in on respect, campaigning for the use of language that sees individuals with disabilities as people."
"The father of a son with autism, Hedrick went before the board of his"
local school district and got action.
"The eight month program gives you a lot of tools in your toolbelt, and I'm just starting to use a few of them."
Some of the ones that I've used is being able to speak to school boards and facilitating a People First language policy.
"What Partners asked me to do, in the course, was to change or create policies, and I saw an opportunity with my school board in Burke"
"County to say, let's use a People First"
language policy let's adopt that.
And the interesting thing is ... and this is what I've learned in Partners.
When you explain this to people. people generally do the right thing.
"People want to facilitate change if it's the right thing, and using a People First"
language policy is just a very good thing.
"And they adopted this policy last year, and they're using it today."
[male narrator]
Others have joined Hedrick as advocates of people first language a movement that has been supported and pressed by the North Carolina
Council on Developmental Disabilities
"Together with other Partners graduates, Hedrick has helped push for People First language with webinars, telling supporters how they can carry the message to their own communities."
"They are demonstrating leadership in their communities, as many Partners graduates do."
Debra Wilson completed the program and later was named a member of the
North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities.
"However, most system leaks are small."
"While they cannot be detected by the naked eye, small leaks are the"
leading cause of poor A/C performance.
"Fortunately, small leaks can be easily corrected using the Interdynamics R134a UV Leak Detector and"
Sealer Kit.
"The kit contains one can of direct charge leak detector dye, which is good for five applications, along with a can of direct charge"
leak sealer.
Also included in the kit is a UV pen
"light and pair of UV fluorescent safety glasses, allowing even the smallest leaks to be quickly detected."
"Before using the kit, identify the"
low-side service port in the A/C system.
"Depending on the vehicle, the low-side port will be located on the accumulator or mounted on the large diameter line between the compressor and the evaporator."
Remember to always wear safety glasses and a pair of mechanics' gloves before working on the system.
Now remove the service port cap and then start the engine and set the A/C controls to maximum cooling.
"Next, remove the cap from the can of leak detector dye and shake the can vigorously."
"While holding the can upside down, place the direct charge nozzle over the low-side port and hold for five seconds."
This will allow one application of dye to be injected.
Now replace the service port cap and allow the engine to run with the A/C on for at least ten minutes in a well ventilated area.
This will give the dye adequate time to circulate.
Driving the vehicle for at
least five miles is another acceptable method for circulating the dye.
"Before checking for leaks, turn the engine off."
"Now, with your UV safety glasses on, shine the pen light around fittings, along metal lines and hoses, and the connections at the rear of the compressor."
The presence of dye in any of these areas indicates that a leak exists.
"To seal the leak, add the leak sealer through the low-side service port with the engine running and the A/C controls set to maximum cooling."
Continue to inject the sealer until the can is completely empty.
"Ok, i start to record"

Imagine that wages went up.
"So imagine now wages, instead of being $5 an hour, are $7.50 an hour."
"They pass a new minimum wage, and wages go up to $7.50 an hour."
What does that do?
"Well, that steepens the isocost."
"Your trade-off is now you're going to get fewer workers for every machine you give up, or more machines for every worker you give up."
"And so at the same isoquant, that's going to shift you to using less labor and more capital."
"By the same logic as before, you're going to use less labor and more capital, because you're going to see this shift in relative prices."
This figure shows why the minimum wage leads to unemployment.
We talked about it last time.
"We did in a graph, we just said supply and demand and showed you."
But actually this is the underlying mechanics of how minimum wage leads to unemployment.
"Because the minimum wage, by change, is relative input prices."
"If the only way you could produce things was with labor, there wouldn't be much unemployment for a minimum wage because basically you wouldn't have anything else you could do."
You'd still have to hire the workers.
"But, in fact, that's not the only way to produce things."
You can substitute to capital.
"As a minimum wage goes up, firms will substitute towards capital, and that's why the minimum wage will lead to unemployment."
So this is sort of the underlying mechanics of how that happens.
"All right, now armed with that-- so basically when we did consumer theory we were done here."
"We basically said, look, we now know you have a budget constraint, you have indifference curves, you're fine with their tangent, you're done."
"The reason firms are one step harder is you don't have a budget constraint. q is not given to you, q is ultimately decided by you."
You the firm are going to decide on little q.
"With our example for consumers, your parents gave you $96, you had no choice."
"Well here the firm isn't given little q, it's going to decide little q."
What that means is we're not done yet.
"There's one extra step we need to do with firms, which is figure out where little q comes from."
"So to do that, we're going to have to then say well, how does a firm think about the set of choices of little q?"
And how does it think about how it changes production as
little q changes?
"So to see that, go to figure 9-4a."
Thank you.
"Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites."
"As a child studying these eternal masterpieces,"
Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
"Late at night, after hours of practicing,"
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
It all became music to me.
I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me.
"But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression,"
"I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument."
"The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience."
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
"The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source."
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas.
"When composers write music for me,"
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello.
"I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I."

bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF:
And to our two-part look at immigration.
On the U.S. Supreme Court docket Wednesday is a tough new law in Arizona.
NewsHour correspondent Tom Bearden traveled there recently and sets the scene for tomorrow's arguments.
TOM BEARDEN:
Daniel Bell's family has raised cattle on this land along Arizona's southern border since the 1930s.
"But in the past few years, he's had to repair the simple barbed-wire fence that separates the U.S. from Mexico more and more often, because the steady stream of people entering the country illegally are always cutting it."
"DANlEL BELL, Arizona:"
So this is a common occurrence every day that we deal with on the ranch.
The price-- I get nervous when I'm running out of time.
So I'm going to do this in the next video.
See you soon.
"So in this problem, we're going to try to build up a given row of Pascal's triangle."
"So you could solve this problem recursively, and that's what I did my first time, but I feel that the iterative solution is a bit simpler and more intuitive to understand."
"This isn't always the case, but this is how I'm going to explain this problem."
"What we're going to do is, we're going to start with a list that's row 1, and then we're going to build the next list by adding the 2 numbers above it."
"More precisely, let's say we're doing the last row, and we have the previous row already made, we're going to start an invisible 0 here, and we're going to say, 1 is going to be the sum of the 0 number that I just made up and the 1 that's the first element of the previous row."
"We're going to update our pointers to move over by 1, and we get to the element 4 by adding 1 and 3."
I'm going to repeat this process all the way through.
6 is 3 + 3.
4 is 3 + 1.
1 is 1 and 0.
"So that's pretty easy to explain, and that's basically how you would do it if you were building it out by hand, but putting it in a code may be a little bit more complicated and have alluded you."
So let's see how it's done.
So if I initialize the first row in the triangle to 1.
"We don't have anything for a result yet, so that's an empty list."
"I'm then going to iterate through the process of building each row 1 at a time, n times."
That way we can get to the nth row.
We're going to append the row that we just discovered onto the result list.
The first time around it will just be the list of 1 because that's how the triangle starts.
"We're then going to find the next row, which I haven't defined yet, and then repeat this process appending the current row onto the result list."
"Once we're done, we're going to return the result."
"So this is a good outline of what we're doing, but we're missing the most important part, and that is the makenextrow."
So a row is going to start as an empty list.
"As I had the 2 pointers before, we're going to have the previous one and then we're going to have one that I'm going to call e."
"So as I said in the description, we're going to start out with 0."
"That way when we add 1, we get 1, which is the sides of the triangle."
We're going to calculate the new entry in the current row by adding e--that's our right pointer--with the previous one that we start at 0 so that we get 1.
"We're going to update the values in previous and then the next iteration, e will update to the next value in row."
This last line basically includes the 1 on the right-hand side.
"Once we return result, triangle can use makenextrow accordingly, and we're done."
"Whenever we're going to do an experiment with two sources which are in phase, at the same frequency, you can predict the directions of maxima and minima and you can even predict the separation, the linear separation, if you know how far away you are from these sources."
And the first demonstration that I'm going to do is with sound.
We have here two loudspeakers.
"And the distance between those two loudspeakers, we're going to do it with sound, D, is 1.5 meters."
That's a given.
And the frequency is 3000 hertz.
"The wavelength, therefore,"
"lambda, equals V divided by the frequency, the speed of sound is about 340 meters per second, divided by 3000, is about 0.113 meters."
So the wavelength is about 11.3 centimeters.
"I can now calculate everyone who is sitting here [fweet] right in the middle through this whole plane will have a maximum of sound, and then when we go away at angle theta, some will again have maxima, and we go further away theta, again maxima, and in between will be the minima."
And I'm going to calculate where they fall in the lecture hall.
The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to give you N as in Nancy and calculate that angle theta of N and I will do it for the maxima.
"In other words, I'm going to use constructive interference and you see there, the sine of theta N is lambda divided by D. That's the equation I use."
When N is 0 the angle is 0.
That is 0 angle.
Everyone here will hear a maximum.
"When N is 1, and you may want to check that at home, I find an angle of 4.3 degrees, and when N is 2, the angle is about double that, is about 8.7 degrees, and when N is 3, it should be close to 13 degrees, 13.1."
"In case you take N is 10, so I skip a few, you get about 49 degrees."
This is where the maximum fall.
And so there's going to be a maximum here and then 4.3 degrees away is again a maximum.
But surely we would like to know how far you in the audience will have to move in order to go from a maximum to a minimum.
"And so the way you have to think of this is that if I make here a picture of the lecture hall, if here are these two sources, you are at a distance L away from here."
Some of you are 5 meters away.
Some are 10 meters away.
"Some are 15 meters away, all the way in the back of the audience."
And you want to know where you're going to hear the maxima.
"I call this X1,"
"I call this X2, and I call this X3, and this is 0."
So this is the meaning of theta 1.
"And this is the meaning of theta 3, and this angle here would be theta 2."
That's the meaning of these angles.
"And so I can calculate now how far you have to move depending upon what capital L is to hear, to go from one maximum in sound to another maximum."
[music].
So let's get going today.
And what we were talking about
"last time is the discovery that the atom was not the most basic constituent of matter, that there was a particle that was even less massive than an atom."
And that is the electron.
"But today, we're going to discover the nucleus."
And so this is 1911.
And this is Ernest Rutherford in England.
And what he was interested in doing was studying the emission from these newly radioactive elements that were being discovered.
"So the emission from radium, for example."
What he did was he got a sample of radium bromide from his friend Marie Curie.
And what was known was that this radium bromide emitted something called alpha particles.
And the exact nature of these alpha particles was not known.
"However, what was known was that they were heavy particles, that they were charged and that they were energetic."
"And, of course, today we know what these alpha particles are."
"They are helium double plus, a helium with two electrons removed."
All right.
So he got this radium bromide.
And alpha particles are being emitted from the radium bromide.
"And he had some kind of detector way out here, which detected these alpha particles."
"And what he found was that at the detector there were about 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
That was the count rate that he was able to measure.
"And then, because he was just trying to figure out what is the nature of these particles, he did this experiment."
"He took a gold foil, a really thin gold foil here, really thin meaning 2^10-5 inches."
That's two orders of magnitude thinner than the diameter of your hair.
I've always wondered how he handled that.
That is pretty thin.
But he put that in there.
"And lo and behold, the count rate that he measured once this gold foil was in place, the count rate was still 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
It appeared that all of the alpha particles that were being emitted just went through the foil right to the detector.
It didn't even seem like those alpha particles knew the foil was there.
"We were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there, and managed to find some sharks."
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see a shark running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
And here it is.
Look at that lovely black shark slime.
"And in about half an hour, we got five samples."
Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now, and they're a bit more dramatic."
You probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
"And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins."
But hey -- sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
So this is possibly going to be my legacy --
Simon's Shark Slime.
We got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples.
"One thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark."
"What you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers, which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark."
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
"If we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it, we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female."
"Because in the moment, they have no way, genetically, of telling the difference between a male and a female, which I find staggering, because they don't know what primers to look for."
"Being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through the sightings, because it is illegal to trade in these sharks."
And they are caught and are on the market.
"So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals, and learn as much as you can."
"They're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained."
You just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
"But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines, such as the geneticists, who can gain so much more from that."
"So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways."
Grab them while you can.
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.
"Hopefully, I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die."
"But for the time being, thank you for that."
And keep an eye out for sharks.
"If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now set up."
"You can't really see, but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels."
"The black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel, rather than a whaling vessel."
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language.
"I don't pretend to [know many Irish words], but in Kerry they were often known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"""
"""the monster with the sails."""
"Another title would be ""liop an dá lapa,"""
"""the unwieldy beast with two fins."""
"""Liabhán mór,"" suggesting a big animal."
"Or my favorite, ""liabhán chor gréine,"" ""the great fish of the sun."""
"That's a lovely, evocative name."
"On Tory Island -- a strange place anyway -- they were known as ""muldoons."""
(Laughter)
No one seems to know why.
Hope there's no one from Tory here.
Lovely place.
"But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish."
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world.
"Some say it's not population decline, it might be a change in the distribution of plankton."
"It's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change, as they're basically continuous plankton recorders, swimming around with their mouth open."
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
There's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
"There's now a ban on catching and even landing them, even landing ones caught accidentally."
"They're not protected in Ireland; in fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever, despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside."
We know very little about them.
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface -- we try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
"I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to ""bask."""
It's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks.
They are awesome creatures.
"It gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them."
"What we've been doing for a couple years -- last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks, so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement and things like that."
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active.
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh Stop telephonin me!"

"If you're in it for the money and you're publishing short stories in a magazine, and you're getting paid something pitiful like a half a penny a word, or a penny a word, you want to figure out ways to resell those stories."
"You'd, love it if somebody sold the movie rights for you and you got a nice commission but the more obvious thing is to publish stories that somehow can go together and then, put them together into a book."
A. E.
"Van Vogt was one of the most successful at doing this, at publishing stories that then could be drawn together into a book."
"He was one of the key writers of science fiction in the so-called golden age from the very late 1930's most people would say, until perhaps the 1960's."
Different people judge this different ways.
"His weapon shops of Isher, his stories of"
"Null A, all came out in separate pieces, and then he put them all together in what he called fix ups."
And in fact a fix up to Van Vogt was just a way of getting some kind of a thread together that would make a story be salable as part of a book.
Some of the more famous fix ups are things
"like Cities in Flight, by James Blish, where we have cities that are sort of self-contained terraria environments out in space, and they go around and each one has its own story."
And it doesn't really make much of a story all together.
"These fix-ups, if they have the right pieces, give you the pleasure of returning to the same premise again and again, it gives you the same kind of pleasure that you might get in re-reading a Sherlock"
Homes story.
"And so these fix-ups were successful, they were successful for the publishers, and they were successful for the, the writers, that is to say people were making money from them."
You don't have to conquer all these small problems that usually are associated with crops.
This had to be done with soybeans.
And these things had be done with corn.
"I mean, if you think about the effort that goes on in corn and soybeans today, in terms of the breeding effort..."
"I mean, you are looking at the breeding effort going on right here."
Win Phippen:
All right.
"Well, welcome everybody."
It's nice to finally meet Hannah.
And welcome to the mom.
"If you guys don't already know, I'm Dr. Win Phippen."
"And what we're doing today, essentially, is giving an opportunity for the interns to come back from their summer projects and sort of report back on what they did all summer long."
What they did for the money.
And tell us all about what they have learned.
And then hopefully we'll have a chance to talk to some of the advisers and the professors and giving us some feedback.
And we definitely want feedback from the students on how we can improve the program.
The grant that this is all part of is trying to create opportunities for students to get interested in the field of plant breeding.
And so we're going to be offering these internship programs for the next three years.
"And we'll have some opportunities to even create other opportunities in doing summer internships not only at Pioneer, at the University of illinois, Iowa State, and over in Peoria, but also summer work positions here on campus during the summer and during the school semester."
"So, today, really is an informal time for the student -- so don't get too nervous -- to present 15 minutes or so of what you've learned on your particular projects."
"And I think what you'll find is, you all worked in plant breeding, or in plant production areas, but you all worked on very different crops."
From chemistry to corn breeding to Hannah's variety of different things.
And then
"later on, we're going to hear from Victoria, our Iowa State person who is coming in on Amtrak, and they won't be here until 11."
"And then she is going to talk about the George Washington Carver program that she did over at Iowa State with Candice Gardner, with that plant introduction station."
"Billie, Student Intern:"
My research at the lab focused on analyzing the percent of oil and moisture and fatty acid content of pennycress.
[Text on screen:
"Billie, Student Intern, WlU School of Agriculture]"
And several studies were conducted while I was there including a position of the seed location on the plant to determine how much oil it had.
And different herbicides were used on the plants.
And a variety of trials were conducted and some other studies.
It would be devastating.
"Scott, one step forward, please."
"Yes, chef."
We're disappointed.
"Luckily for you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;there were two dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;worse than yours.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Back on your station, please."
"Yes, chef. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ryan, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;one of you has just cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition."
My dish looks ten times better than his dish.
How is this even possible?
"Even though my dish might have been uglier in presentation, it was still edible."
"The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked the worst dish...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I just wanted to say&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that I am definitely not ready to go home yet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you were right.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The hero of this dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was the duck, and, out of the two of us, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I would say that the duck&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was better executed by me."
I don't care. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you guys can't eat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;raw duck.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
No begging.
"You're in this competition competing, not judging."
Let's get that right.
Have some respect for your fellow contestants.
The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the worst dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in our first mystery box challenge &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) The judges have already singled out the two worst dishes.
"Out of the two of us,"
I would say that the duck was better executed by me.
No begging.
"(Announcer) And now, for the first time, someone will be stripped from their apron, and sent home from a mistery box challenge."
The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the worst dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;belongs to&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;...
Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please take your apron off&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and place it on your station.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're leaving&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm definitely sad to leave the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen this early.
"I didn't think my dish was the star of the challenge, but I didn't think it was the loser of the challenge."
It was definitely a learning process.
"It has given me more zeal for my passion, and is not gonna stop me."
"I don't mean to be a hater, but, man, come on,"
"Ryan, for him to throw Samantha under the bus like that, was a [Bleep] bitch move."
"Ryan, back on your station."
"(Becky) You can never feel safe here, and I think that that's exactly what they were trying to tell us, so you better be bringing your a-game every single day. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Winning every challenge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; every pressure test, results to so many advantages &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"And today, the glory does belong to somebody, because their dish stood out &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;above their competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
To comfort them told him this:
"""The Ministry that our Lord God will reward, isn't so much the visible fruit of Pastoral Ministry, teaching, or for evangelisation but the Messenger will be faithful to God who will be rewarded """
"The Lord God takes care of the people, because it is a sovereign God and faithful, and then takes care of his slaves."
"We're the remains clinging to the truth and walk humbly before Christ, for our financial support, the Lord God will take care."
The truth is this: the Lord is not indebted to those who serve him humbly based in truth.
God does not need anything to these people: it simply takes care of them!
Our family lived so for almost 10 years.
"Then you have nothing to fear, because since we donated to the Ministry, you can be sure that the Lord God knows that the name and honor of God are involved and will not allow its name suffers from delusions or stains."
He will worry that you have the support and care you need.
"Because God is his name and zeloso honor, so you a privilege to serve the Lord God."
"And this we already know in this life, that we receive 100 times more whatever"
"We have left behind, but the best of all this, and in the life to come, we will be with him for eternity."
"These brothers working in harsh and difficult conditions must remember what most matter: in the day when God will call us,"
What will count in the end is right if there was this sense of submission and faithfulness to the Gospel message.
"If these are true brothers and are seeking the help and God's presence in their Ministry, as well as the word says, urging and invoking (with a spirit Bereano) people to repentance, these people will be blessed, and should rejoice because it is just that what the Lord wants from them."
"Be faithful, you who serve the Lord."
"When their aim is the glory of God, the good of the Church and the salvation of sinners, this can draw various consequences: can first define the implementation of Ministry."
You can find a face with others who don't have the same motivation and can be tricky.
But we must remember that it is more important to be approved by God that by men.
It is important to be like God rather than men.
"Be faithful, and God will bless you for eternity."
Serving God is the most spectacular thing of this world.
"If your leader is God, your benefits and your retirement will be from another world!"
Worth it!
A hug.

"Steven Pinker actually says that we are becoming more peaceful. so we did better in terms of our nature, believing the statistics."
In Toronto the crime rate has gone down.
I am not saying that is because  40 faculties are teaching the world how to meditate.
But Toronto is not the place where the crime rate should be going down.
I am not going to put those 2 statistics together but they certainly are curiosities.
"So imagine the changes you can bring and  you don't have to wait for funding, you don't have to do anything more  than to start the practise yourself."
"And you started it already,  otherwise you would not be here."
"So in closing I am going to say... (Laughter) my five streams that  at University of Toronto are mindfulness and psychotherapy, East and West so that we look at integrating  eastern-western concepts so you don't throw out the baby with the bath water."
Mindfulness in contemplative education.
"Mindfulness and the mind that works, in another word, how we can work more efficiently and effectively, by breathing and being mindful."
I have seen the embracing of that at very  significant NGOs and corporate cultures.
"We also have the embodied mind, which is part of what Thay talks about and Dan Siegel."
Yoga and mindfulness which  is being used in psychiatric facilities in downtown Toronto.
"And the last one is contemplative art, using art to be able  to bring our attention home."
"So, I am going to finish  by saying thank you very much and again much gratitude to the faculties  of University of Toronto, as well as to my masters for their  brilliance, their insight, their courage to be the change that we wish to see."

(R. Brady) Thank you Michele.
Our next speaker is actually  one of Michele's teachers.
"And in her program, Theo Koffler,  who besides teaching in the program at University of Toronto, is the founder  of Mindfulness Without Border, which has done very wonderful work in very troubled countries around the world."
And has now come back to Canada.
"- (R. Brady) Theo, - (Theo Koffler) Thank you, Richard."
"I feel so much of my story is part  of the stories that you have heard so far, and I can't wait to hear what happens towards the end."
I just want to start off by telling you  that my heart swells with excitement.
"When I look out to you, 1300 educators, I think, in this room, all interested in bringing mindfulness into your life, taking it into your professional worlds,  into education or health care, wherever you are situated."
"And to know that, in 2005, I was part  of a small group of people that developed the first ever  symposium for contemplation education."
And we were 35 people  around the table.
"And thanks to Thay and  his wonderful community, here you are, being offered the opportunity  explore the mindfulness and discover it by yourself and bring it on home."
"So, I am just so terribly blessed,  pleased and grateful at the same time to be here with you."
"So, as you heard, all of us has been asked a little bit how we got into mindfulness."
So my purpose today  is to tell you that.
So I've seen my share of waiting rooms like this.
She's right.
"If antibiotics are used too often for things they can't treat,"
"like colds, flu, or other viral infections, they can stop working effectively against bacteria when you really need them."
"Antibiotic resistance, when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections, has been a concern for years."
Everyday problems can become much worse if we can't use our first line of defense.
Children can need hospitalization for superbugs that don't respond to common antibiotics.
"As a parent, you can do something."
"For example, understand that many ear infections and sore throats may not need antibiotics."
"Work with your doctor to understand the difference between infections that are viral and don't respond to antibiotics,"
"like the cold or the flu, and infections that are bacterial and do respond to antibiotics, like strep throat."
Always follow the directions on any antibiotic prescription.
"This means taking the prescribed amount of medicine, even if feeling better, and not sharing or saving antibiotics, not even for other family members."
Antibiotics are a powerful tool.
"But you wouldn't slice a tomato with a chain saw, right?"
Antibiotics may not always be the answer.

GlRL:
"Soothe a sore throat with ice chips, sore-throat spray, or lozenges, but don't give lozenges to young children."
Use a decongestant or saline nasal spray to help relieve nasal symptoms.
"Put a warm, moist cloth over an ear that hurts."
"To help relieve a cough, use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer or try breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water or a shower."
You might need some pain reliever for that ache or fever.

Afterwards you get to your computer at 4 or 5 in the morning and you try to be minimally creative and provide a bit of context and tell things that weren't being told in the rest of the media.
"Not regarding the focus, but rather looking for details which you think define what was happening."
"And try to write features that give people an idea of what's happening, way beyond whatever controversial incident may have happened that day."
"And then you sleep 3 hours, and then off you go again."

"Yesterday Virginia, from 20minutos, was here."
One thing that called my attention was they were always there.
It was the first media corporation that I began to recognise.
"I met Mirem, I met Marta, I saw them there..."
And it was a question of taking it easy.
Taking your time.
"It was hard to interpret, but you had to take your time."
Many media corporations didn't do that.
JL:
"It's a luxury, isn't it."
We allowed ourselves the luxury of spending hours in a square informing about that was happening.
It's hard for that to happen in a media corporation.
Very complicated.
We were born to do that.
We were born out of this journalistic crisis and we decided to slow down and inform with a bit of good sense.
"And we did that, and we created Periodismo Humano."
"But there's a lot of merit in other manstream media corporations which we are very critical of, but we have to acknowledge that there are some media corporations, especially some journalists who in their free time, went to the square because they decided they didn't need permission from their boss, their corporation or their structure, they went there because they wanted to be journalists for this kind of thing."
"The rest of the year they're bored, and when something interesting like this happens, and things are going on, they want to be there in the square."
If I hadn't been working in Periodismo Humano I would have spent my free time there.
And I'd have done the same job through my personal blog.
"I'm sure of that. fortunately there was a structure and co-workers who as a group made everything so much more valid, more visible, and richer."
But I'm sure that any of the journalists there would have done exactly the same thing.
"Because you become a journalist for things like this, and if they happen and you don't experience them, why bother?"
ST:
"To finish with the topic of journalism, I'd like you to tell me what the relationship with the people who gave you your information was like."
"Because the beginning was complicated, that first week."
But I get the impression that the management of that information was very efficient.

"What was the cause of death, as determined by the autopsy?"
The decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.
Why did her body shut down?
The autopsy found that it was a cumulative effect... ...from numerous physical traumas exacerbated by malnutrition... ...which severely inhibited her ability to recuperate from those traumas.
"In other words, her starving body had little or no means to recover... ...from the injuries it was sustaining, and so it eventually just gave out."
How did Emily get these injuries?
Some were the result of violent epileptic seizures... ...and some were self-inflicted.
"And why, in your opinion, did Emily injure herself... ...and why did she stop eating?"

"So, I'm really good at taking notes on this; I am terrible at editing."
And it just means if I really wanted to become good at actually...
"If I had to do final papers or let's say documents for my boss or something on this device, I would really have to practice using that before and after letter, ah, issue I was just talking about."
But it's really confusing if you're not used to it.
"Because sometimes you're before the letter, sometimes you're after, depending on the direction you've moved."
And I'm making a big deal of that because I don't want that to throw anyone or convince anyone not to do this.
"Ah, it's just something that if you practice with, it's fine."
"When I go to meetings, I just do a lot of writing."
And there's a thing in here where you can email the note to yourself.
"And you get all the text, errors included, and that works out great."
"There's actually, If I can input here, there's actually a very good article on macaccessibility.net and that's www.macaccessbility.net, under the tutorials section that describes the cursor and how the cursor in mac or ios differs from the cursor in Windows."
"Uh, it describes it really well."
"That's what I read when I started using the ios devices cuz it got, it got me confused too."
"I'm like 'Wait a minute,'"
"'I didn't want to delete that character, I wanted to delete the one to the left.'"
"Then I read that article and now I realize that the cursor is different between the two operating systems, and so it's ah..."
I still make mistakes myself.
It takes a bit of getting used to.
I have done editing on here.
"But yeah, it's, It's definitely different than Windows."
[new speaker]
"And it's actually kind of neat because it's much more precise, but if you're not used to it it can really throw you."
And I don't want to waste everyone's time.
"If I were home, I'd spend the next ten minutes making this pristine just for the challenge, but I'm not going to waste everybody's time and do that."
[Audience member]
Thank you.
"Um..There's a lot of different places throughout the iPhone that you can actually go into edit mode, you'd like to be able to go into edit mode, like in the search fields, and um, and ah, text messaging, and things like that."
"Does this keyboard, this edit mode, work in every single one of the iPhone apps?"
Or does it only work in the notes?
"Um, the keyboard will work in any of the edit fields."
That's the nice thing about all of the ios devices.
"If you have an edit field in texting, or whether it's in notes, or Navigon, or any field, or any application, this keyboard's going to work with it. cuz an edit box is an edit box. and if the developer has-- [sudden library announcement over PA system]"
So we will often reject a paper.
Right away.
And now let me just tell you the process that we go through at the American Journal of Epidemiology.
"At first, it's looked at by the editor-in-chief and then he assigns it to one of the other editors, who really makes the final decision and I happen to play that role, as a general epidemiology editor."
"There are other more specialized editors that work just in cancer, or just in cardiovascular disease or just in infectious diseases, but I tend to be more general."
And so.
"If the two of us think that the paper is not going to be of sufficient priority to be accepted, even if it's good science and well-reviewed, then as a favor to the authors, we won't delay a rejection of it."
"Another, beside novelty, another criterion we look at is interest to the readers of this particular journal."
"For example, sometimes we'll get a paper that really is not so much an epidemiological study, but a way to improve public health, and we will decide, you know, this is really."
"More suitable to a, to a public health journal then to the American Journal Of"
Epidemiology.
"We, also look for good writing, and this can be especially a be a problem, with a non-english speaking author."
"Usually when a paper comes from a foreign country, often the english is, really, bad and we know it's gonna need a lot of work, and we think it's a good study, we will often, send it back and say please have a, someone, a native english speaker go through this and edit it."
"And occasionally this comes, when a foreign, person who is, who's english who's, lang, need of languages not english."
It works in an American institution and submits a paper.
So you know usually that is not a problem.
But it can be.
Mm-hm.
Another Fact.
"Factors that you know, don't make the paper too long."
Don't put in too much excess material that's not needed.
And another important problem is what we call slicing the salami too thin.
"Yes, yeah that would be great for you to say a bit about it."
"You know, if you, [laugh], I have a study that involves both men and women and want to try to get two papers out of it say here's what that risk factor, here's the effect of this risk factor in men."
And then another paper here's the effect of this risk factor in women that is really frowned upon by journals.
And my own personal experience is that I was I had to deal with this as an author.
"A colleague and I, each wrote a paper about health effects of cigar smoking."
This was at Kaiser Permanente.
His was on cardiovascular disease.
Mine was on cancer.
"I submitted I, mine to the, Annals of Epidemiology and was accepted."
He submitted his to the New England Journal.
So they're really critical for a Greywater System.
And you don't actually have to do anything; you just need to have healthy soil.
And I just want to show you my favorite one.
"This is, you know, sort of not an exactly realistic picture."
So microscopic organism; this one is called the Tardigrade.
Any of you heard of the Tardigrade?
"Now, this little bitty microscopic organism went into space and it survived space and it formed, turns itself into a cyst and can survive pretty much anything."
It came back to earth and reproduced.
"So these things are--you know, in the soil, there's really strong organisms that can do just about anything like survive space."
"So we don't--if we get our Greywater going into healthy soil, we don't have to worry so much about the nutrients in it and the gunky stuff. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thanks.
"So, the Tardigrades are going to save us."
"Okay, we're going to take a little bit of a deeper dive now and focus on one particular system, the laundry to landscape system."
And I think the value of taking a focus on this one is this is considered like the low-hanging fruit of Greywater Systems.
It's a great place to start.
And I'll just run you through at a very high level here how it's done.
"Firstly, obviously, as Laura had mentioned, we have to be careful about what detergents or soaps we use in the first place."
We have to use non-toxic ingredients.
"And then we can re-use that water that's coming out of the washing machine, divert it--and"
I'll show you some parts here in a minute--out to the landscape and grow food with it or shelter or a beautiful backyard oasis.
"Really, whatever we desire in terms of our backyard spaces or front yard landscapes, for that matter."
"Here's a little deeper dive; oops, excuse me."
This is a schematic of a laundry to landscape system.
It shows you how the plan would work in effect.
"Obviously, it's showing the collection plumbing here that distributes out to the landscape--thank you--out to the landscape and actually, emits the water directly into the soil."
And that connects with the mulch basins that we just heard Laura talk to.
"So, the beauty of this system is that, well, for one, it has a built-in pump."
It uses the pump of the washing machine.
"So if there are any distributions challenges, maybe you have a slight incline."
There are some ways to overcome those challenges because you have this built-in pump.
"Apart from that, no additional gadgetry is required."
"No filters to break down, which is wonderful."
There are like 2500 jobs that.
Can't even possibly do them.
"See them at project per, oops, per capital growth rate for Medicare spending, so, you're on your way controlling fro the number of people in Medicare."
"If the predicted growth rate exceeds the target, iPad will develop a set of proposal to reduce the Medicare spending."
"The HHS, that's Health and Human Service must implement the proposals unless [inaudible] adopts equally effective alternative."
"So basically, this going to affect unless Congress acts."
"So, no additional legislation needed."
To make these proposals go in and you have fifteen wise men and women giving you the best ideas.
"So, starting in January twenty-eighth, being the target is GDP per capita plus one%."
What have we been doing in terms of growth over the last 40 years?
Gdp plus two.
"This cuts back rate in half, remember that yellow, I think it was the yellow line we had right at the start."
That was cutting the rate in half.
"So, pretty effective."
Congress can overrule only if it's pact by both houses.
With the majority.
"The proposal include any recommendation to rush in health care raise revenues for medicare beneficiary premium, increase medicare beneficiary co-sharing including deductibles, co-shares and co-payments or otherwise restrict benefits to modi fy eligibility."
"So you can't say well, we cannot exclude certain procedures to get this target."
You basically have to get more efficient care to hit this target.
"And by the way, hospitals are excluded for the first period of time because they supposedly gave a lot of."
Of cross savings in that adjustment that we described earlier.
Just recently the [inaudible] committee approved [inaudible] that would eliminate the health force independent payment advisory board.
The bill could be considered by the full house as early as next week.
That's why it's in the news so Congress putting in the bill and actually the President insist that into bill because Peter convinced them it was as fail safe for cost control.
Congress hates the idea.
Why does Congress. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Take the idea about re-election.
"Yeah, why is Congress hate the idea of the iPad?"
"Of this independent [inaudible] and Advisory Board saying, here are changes and if you don't. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [inaudible]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Congress is giving up power, right?"
Some other boards doing it.
It's basically a vote of no confidence in Congress.
You guys can't do the right thing.
"So, we're going to have this independent board."
"Which is that when you stop the front end of the garage, of the ladder, you also stop the"
left end of the ladder.
"Remember, that at this point the right end of the ladder smashes into a wall, and it stops."
"Now, what is going to happen is the back end of the ladder just lik e our slinky, when I dropped it has not yet heard that the front end of the ladder has crashed into something."
The left end of the ladder continues to come at speed v until somebody tells it.
What tells it?
"Well, a sound wave, of course will be propagating down this ladder as the front end of it crumples, propagating back to tell the back end of the ladder, wait, there is an extra force, we need to stop."
How fast does the sound wave travel?
"Well that depends on what the ladder is made of, but I know a limit."
"The sound wave will not travel back to the ladder in it's own frame, or in any other frame that's happily an invariant faster then the speed of light."
"So at this event when the front end of the ladder crashes into the door, you can imagine a sound wave propagating back up the ladder to the left, trying to tell the left end to stop."
"So, how fast can this signal propagate?"
"Well, this is the fastest it can propagate."
"The fastest that the rear end of the ladder can hear, but the front has stopped, is the speed of"
light.
"So I've drawn a light speed, 45 degree propagation of the signal from the back of the ladder, from the front of the ladder to the back telling it to stop."
"And if this were the case. you notice that by the time this light being reaches the back end of the ladder, back end of the ladder is well within the garage because even in the ladder frame, we are now talking about a positive time."
Right?
"And so, time has"
"The, the, remember, the left end of the ladder entered the garage here."
"By now, the left end of the ladder is well in the garage."
If you stop the front end of the
"ladder, the back end would keep coming."
"You would not, be able to stop it until it was in the garage."
"Now, what happens at the moment."
To the actual ladder when the soundwave) propagates and reaches the back.
Well the energies involved are such that most ladders would probably blow themselves up to smithereenes or crumble to atoms.
But in any event by the time the rear end of the ladder appears that the front end has stopped.
And ma ybe we have a very powerful ladder and it's elastic and it springs back out and re-expands by the time all that and crashes into the garage door.
"But the time, by the time all of that, any of that happens the ladder is well within the garage."
And so the fact that you managed to close the doors.
"Is not an interruption when you close the doors. at this event, the ladder, had, the"
So the buildings will vary depending on the interests of the occupant.
"Other than that, there would be a very wide selection of what buildings people can live in."
"All the lines are curved, which makes the building much stronger."
And the boats and helicopter is there for your use.
In the future i don't think people will want to own anything anymore.
Everything is there for their use.
But you don't own anything.
You live in a building as long as you like.
You can travel any place you want to travel.
"And then if you come over here, this may be a model of an art center in the future, where artist materials, you have access to any material you want."
There is no fee anymore.
And so what you see here is different buildings and different mechanisms that serve a different purpose.
This represents a joint venture of all the world's people going out into space together and using it for the benefit of everyone.
"Now, if you come over here, you will see these are exhibition buildings."
Some of them we built for China originally.
And this represents a rooftop landing area.
And the rooftop gardens will be on all buildings in the future.
All of the larger buildings will have a rooftop gardens or solar generators as part of the roof.
"Jacque Fresco sees all repetitive tasks being performed by automated machinery in the future, enabling people to have more free time to explore their areas of interest and help advance society."
This is a way we produce buildings in the future.
This is a machine that has a die placed in this area and then it squeezes the buildings out like that.
And then a laser beam cuts them.
And this machine picks the building off and transfers it to this machine.
"And this machine, if i can change my position, if you can see this, this machine shoves the building onto that ramp."
It shoves on like that.
"And once it gets there, the memory metals lock and keep it in place."
"The buildings will be put up in dry dock, that means like ships are built."
Then a machine that looks like this will travel along putting in the windows and everything.
"And then when the buildings are finished, say you have got like 10 buildings finished in here, then we flood it with water and the buildings are built on a float, and we float the building to the location."
Then we use water jets under the building.
So we slip the building in place like that.
"Instead of bringing building material out there and cut it up and make it, we make them all in dry dock and we move them on water, because with water you can move heavy freight and it doesn't have to be fast."
My pleasure.
"And I apologize for calling in a few minutes late, and I apologize to the speaker who I interrupted as a result."
"From what I caught at the very end it seemed interesting, so I'll let you all get back to that."
Brad:
We'll get right back to that.
"Thank you, Steve, and have a good rest of the day."
Steve: you too.
Thanks Brad.
Brad: before returning to Mark Schmeissing I just want to take care of a couple housekeeping matters.
I understand from questions that have come in that some folks in the audience have had difficulties with the audio portion.
"And some folks have been saying, ""When will the recorded webinar be made available?"" Before we go off the air here today and we complete the discussion of CSBG we will tell our"
listeners when the recorded webinar will be available.
"Someone else also wrote in, Mr. Todd Richardson, for the lobbying and advocacy work that we're going to be doing for the member request letters that"
"Senator Reed's legislative director referred to earlier, will we be sending out talking points for those of us making the calls?"
Answer:
"Yes, definitely, Todd, we will be doing that."
As soon as we get the letters from Senators Reed and Collins we will be sending those talking points out to everybody who is on this webinar and everyone who is part of our network.
"So we will be coming back to more questions that have come in, but what I'd like to do at this point, just to alert Mark Schmeissing, you do have a number of questions, Mark."
"So let's come back and complete your regular presentation, and then let's get right into the questions for the remaining 30 minutes of this webinar."
Mark:
That sounds great.
Thanks Brad.
So I'm just going to finish up with the overview of ROMA Next
Generation Grant.
We've talked through what we are doing in that process.
"If we go to the next slide, you'll see a diagram developed by the urban institute."
This figure is supposed to show how the three different training and technical assistance efforts are fitting together.
"In the center you'll see those core organizational standards that mainly speak to organizational capacity (things like leadership and governance and community engagement, human resource management, financial operations)."
Those are the things that are being developed through the Organizational Standards Center of Excellence.
Around that you'll see ROMA 2.0 which is another way that the ROMA Next Generation Center of
Excellence is referred to.
That ROMA cycle is the ongoing community action system that's framing our specific and special mandates to address the causes and traditions of poverty.
"You're going to be very, very busy."
It's going to ruin your evening.
It's our strategy.
Some more questions?
Yes? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"Matt Asanti, IFA International. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Hi there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"You mentioned all of the benefits of the new technology and I'm sure when you're doing your research as well, you're considering the downsides with all of the information that you're collecting and possessing."
"So, what are the dangers according to you?"
And do you think there's a real danger also in creating an elite by restricting access to the Internet as well? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, for the latter part, we've worked, all of us at Google, I personally--many people that I've worked with have worked very hard to make the Internet available to everyone."
"And because of the tremendous success of mobile phone, data and a particular GPRS edge, UMTS and now LTE Technology, it's reasonable to expect that over the next 5 to 10 years, 5 out of the 6 billion or so humans will have access to some level of mobile connectivity and some number of billions, certainly more than one because we're nearly there now, will have access to powerful smartphones and the kind of web computing."
"That is a life-changing experience for them, so I'm very, very excited about it."
I think that the downsides are all obvious.
"It's always a shock to people to discover that criminals use the telephone, and yet we still use the phone."
We haven't banned the telephone.
"And I think the fact of the matter is that there are evil people in the world, they will use this technology."
It's important that we be alert.
It's important that we recognize that the laws are there for the reason that we all follow them.
But we have no illusion about how this technology could be misused as well.
"And I think that the governments in the world, police forces and so forth need to focus on this because it will be a new source, among other things, of some bad behavior as well as hopefully enormous amount of good behavior. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT], I'm working for a German"
Radio Stations.
Will Google phones also be able to identify people in the future?
"You gave us a great example with this cathedral, how about I point my hand--my Google phone on just, say, a person that I want his email address or like his hobbies or--can Google help me with that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
The answer is no.
And I hope that--and
"I'm sorry if you wanted that feature, it's no."
There are a number of reason why it's no.
"One is it's illegal because you can't use--in the European law, you can't use that kind of information which, I think, is a good law."
So the second thing is that it would be a significant invasion of people's privacy.
"So, if people want to give you that information, it's easy for them to transmit it, but you won't be able to randomly find things out about people without their permission. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And in the US? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Same answer.
"For example, if I pick rock and you paper then you win."
I picked rock and you scissors then I win.
And so on.
"Again, the payoffs in both cases sum to zero."
"This parenthetically, this very simple children game actually has an annual competition that carries a nontrivial prize of $10,000 and it's actually a sobering thought that when we look at this trivial game then, perhaps, chuckle a little bit, if we actually participated in this competition we'd actually think hard about how to play it."
"Here's the other extreme, of games of pure coordination or pure cooperation."
"In this case, all agents have exactly the same interest."
"In other words, the payoffs for every action vector that they take is the same."
And so the utility for player 'i' is always the same as the utility for player 'j' for every action vector that they choose.
"And so again we here, too, will need to write each cell of matrix only one number because it's common to all the players."
"It's drives home that perhaps the unfortunate term ""noncooperate"" game theory that describes this dominant strand of game theory that we are discussing for now"
"It's, the name was suggested these are games for, that descibe situations that are inherently conflictual but as we see they apply also to games in which the interests of the players coincide."
So here's a game that describes the purely cooperative situation.
You and I walk towards each other on the sidewalk.
We can each decide whether to go to our respective left or respective right.
And if we pick the same side then all is good.
We avoid a collision.
"If we don't, then we do collide and that's equally bad for both of us."
"Of course in general, games will be neither purelly cooperative nor purely conflictual and here's a game that exemplifies that."
"This is a game that's called ""Battle of the Sexes."""
So imagine a husband and a wife who want to go out to a movie.
There are two movies that they can choose from.
"Let's say ""Battle of Armageddon"" and ""Flower Child."""
"The one, a violent war movie, and the other is a romantic comedy."
Above all they want to go together to the movie.
If they go to different movies then they are equally unhappy.
So they want to go to the same movie but they have conflicting preferences.
"The wife clearly would prefer to go to ""Battle of Armageddon"" and the husband, as romantic as he is, would like to go to ""Flower Child."""
"So, both cooperation and competition in this game."
"İyi ki doğdun, Fatmagül."
"[Glad that you were born, Fatmagül.]"
"Happy birthday, halacığım."
We know it's not a sink vertex cause we're assuming there aren't any.
So there's an outgoing arc so let's follow it.
"We get to some other node, by assumption there's no sink vertex so this isn't a sink vertex."
So there's an outgoing arc.
"So let's follow it, we get to some other node."
"That also has an outgoing arc, let's follow that, and so on."
So we just keep following outgoing arcs.
"And we do this as long as we want, because every vertex has at least one outgoing arc."
"Well, there's a finite number of vertices."
Right?
"This graph has, say, N vertices."
"So, if we follow N arcs, we're gonna see N plus one vertices."
"So, by the pigeon hold principle, we're gonna have to see a repeat."
Right?
"So, if N plus one vertices has only N distinct vertices, we're gonna see some vertex twice."
"So, for example, maybe after I take the outgoing arc from this vertex."
I get back to this one that I saw previously.
"Well, what have we done, what happens when we get a repeated vertex?"
By tracing these out going arcs and repeating a vertex we have exhibited a directed cycle.
And that's exactly what we're assuming doesn't exist.
We're talking about directed acyclic graphs.
"So, put differently, we just proved that a vertex with no sink vertex has to have a directed cycle."
So a directed acyclic graph therefore has to have at least one sink vertex.
"So, here's how we use this very simple observation now to compute a topological order of a directed acyclic graph."
Well let's do a little thought experiment.
Suppose in fact this graph did have a topological ordering.
Let's think about the vertex that goes last in this topological ordering.
"Remember, any arc which goes backward in the ordering is a violation."
So we have to avoid that.
We have to make sure that every arc goes forward in the ordering.
"Now, any vertex which has an outgoing arc, we better put somewhere other than in the final position, all right?"
"So the node that we put in the final position, all of its arcs are gonna wind up to all of its outgoing arcs are gonna wind up going backward in the topological ordering."
"So I, I was hoping you could comment on that."
[laugh].
"Well I. I, I don't think you'll necessarily dumb down the science."
"And, of course you do want precision and clarity."
"But, I think you should avoid jargon and things that are really hard to understand."
"George Comstock, who's no longer alive but he was used to be the Editor in Chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology, used to say that, papers should be understandable by someone with a good college education or someone who reads the Scientific American."
"It does not have to be full of jargon that's only understood by your, your peers and your particular specialty."
Yeah.
So I would.
You know we welcome things that are very readable and easy to read.
"I don't, I, I, I would not have that fear at all."
Yeah and.
"In terms of getting published when you get two papers in and say they were the same science and one was very jargony and you know, sounds sort of the way, scientists think they have to write and you have one that's clear, can you comment on your chances of publication."
"Well you know, if both of them get peer reviewed and, and very highly rated and they seem like, they seem important to the editors we might ask."
"You know, to please explain what you mean by this, word or by this sentence?"
"Yeah, yeah."
So it will take an extra step if it's really hard to understand and not clear to most readers.
"Yeah, yeah."
And what advice can you give specifically to first time authors?
"I imagine a lot of, the students in this course are, you know, early in their career."
"And haven't had a chance to get published yet or, or, in the process of submitting their first papers?"
"What bothers me most, is when I get a paper, you know, often be from a really good institution and the senior author at the end of the list is someone who's well known, but it's clear its been written by a student, [laugh], and, if it sounds like a thesis, it sounds like a Phd thesis, or masters thesis, Which, and it contains every conceivable strength of the study, every conceivable weakness, [laugh], so that, to prove, in writing the thesis they learned what they were supposed to learn in a school public."
Author in their graduate program.
"So, Right is if you were more established senior scientist who knows what other scientists understand."
"And, you don't have to explainuh, something to everything."
"I just happened to see a paper this morning in the latest journal of the American Journal of Epidemi-, the latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology that was going over the strength and limitations of there study."
"And, it was a study about mortality and, in whites and African Americans and related to a certain."
"Factor, and I was saying, one of the strength of our study is that we had a"
large African American.
Population as part of this study group.
"Well, that's sort of obvious or you wouldn't."
"Right, right, [laugh]."
You do it with scientific measurements.
"So, today what people do is they use heuristics."
And the heuristics in that space are terrible.
The second issue in display has to do with standardization of ad formats.
"So, again, here you are--you have a property, you have a place for display."
And there's not agreement at the level that it needs to be on the standardization of the delivery of the display.
And especially around interactive and video ads.
"If you think about it, the future of display ads is not a static picture, but rather an ad that brings you in--that tells you a narrative."
The best ads add real value to the consumer's experience.
We take the view that ads are valuable if they're targeted and are information-rich.
"And the most information-rich, by obvious argument, is something which involves video and a story, and a narrative, and more references."
And the technology will enable the creation of those.
"And then the third, in our case, is the construction of the business relationship with the large advertisers we're still working on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"If there's a 10 second question and a 20 second answer, fire away. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;OFF MlKE SPEAKER:"

"Microsoft and Yahoo come together, given you started off the conversation talking about consumers can be fickle switching search engines?"
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
I don't know if that scenario will occur.
"We did our best attempt at a deal with Yahoo, and as you know, we had to cancel it at the very last minute."
We wish them the best of luck.
And Carol is a fine and able CEO.
What do I really think will happen here?
I think that the problem has to do with Microsoft's ability to use its Windows monopoly to restrict consumer choice.
That's not a new subject.
It's been discussed at great length.
"So anything that Microsoft would do that would eliminate consumer choice with respect to search engines, Internet browsers, distribution-- for which it was previously found guilty--are of concern."
And there's a history of that.
So that's what we worry about.
"I think as long as the technologies are competing on a fair to fair basis,"
I think that's great. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;MARY:
"On that note, Eric, thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
There are a couple of opportunities for algebraic simplifications.
"So, we can replace the squaring up here, by a multiply."
"And down here we had a multiply by two, which we can replace by a left shift of one."
Next we can observe that we have some copies and constants.
So we have a constant assignment to b and a copy assignment to c And those can be propagated forward to the uses of b and c.
"Once we've done that, we can do constant folding."
"So here, the assignment to e, The opera-, the arguments to the shift are all constants, And so that can be replaced by an assignment, that e gets the value six."
Next we could observe that we have a common sub expression that we could eliminate that both a and d have the value x times x.
So the assignment to d could be replaced by a copy that d now gets the value of a.
Now we have two opportunities again for copying constant propagation the assignment to D and the assignment to E can be propagated forward.
And finally we can do a bunch of dead code elimination.
"So, assuming that, none of these values, B, C, D, or E is used anyplace else in the program, all four of these statements can be deleted."
And this is where we actually get some real performance improvement.
"So here we actually are now saving entire instructions, and that's the best kind of savings that we can have And so we wind up with this as our final form."
So notice that a is assigned the value x*x.
"F is then assigned, the value a+a, And then g is assigned the value six*f."
"Now, this is not quite as fast as it could be, alright?"
There's actually one more algebraic optimization that could be done.
"We can notice here that f is actually=to two*a,"
And then we could do some rearrangement here to discover that g=12*f.
"Sorry, sorry twelve x a."
"Alright, And then this statement assignment to F might become dead code, and we could delete it from the program."
"I think some compilers would actually find this, but I believe that even current state of the art compilers, many of them, would not discover this last rearrangement to the program."
My name's Raquel Ruvalcaba and I work with the Department of Environment and we're recycling oil for o ur community today.
"""Thank you."" When they recycling it we can actually go into a refinery and they c an reuse it again."
"""Aqui no mas."" They do the oil changes themselves anyway, so now they know where to take it back to, and what to do with it."
"""A lot of people don't change their own oil cuz they think it's a headache."
"I do, always have."
"""I change motor oil often."" ""And I don't throw it down the sewers either, like other people used to do."" ome people do."
"""It's safe for the environment and also you can reuse it."" ""So bring it here, and if you have a whole bunch of toxics you want to get rid of just call that number, they'll collect it at your home."" ""It's a waste to throw it all away when you can reuse it again."
"It still has life in it, all i t has is just dirt."
It just needs to be filtered out and it can be used for other products.
let that fade away.
"You have to think about, OK, just the interface."
Is the interface conveying the right things?
"And then beyond the interface, the mental model."
How is the user simulating this in their head?
What information are they getting out of it?
"So back to the diagram, letting that implementation fade away."
So that's self-describing.
"At least, that's talking about if something should be self-describing, but how do you pull that off?"
"It's one thing to say it's important, it's another thing to tell you literally how to do it."
So there's at least five ways.
"The first one is consistency, and this is cheating, basically."
"It works great, but it's also a kind of a tautology to say, hey, if I design something that's things that the user already knows, they're going to know how to use it."
That is true.
"You do not have to rely on this entirely, though."
"In fact, Google products are often very different from what's already in the marketplace, and they still are able to bootstrap knowledge from users and have them figure it out."
"I mean, in the case of Gmail, it was sort of a radical reimagination of how email interfaces worked, but it still worked."
"And also, if everyone did consistency all the time, we wouldn't see dramatic innovation in interfaces."
So we're not going to focus on this one too much.
"Basically, it's really useful, and you can guarantee that users are going to understand your application if you focus on consistency, but it's not the only way."
So the second one is affordances.
"Let's go back to the test chamber, and let's say one day, they encounter this, and they've never seen it before, and they're thinking, whoa, that's really interesting."
This might actually be a way out of the test chamber.
And how are they going to figure that out?
Everything about this design is designed to convey what it does.
"The way that the door is recessed from the frame, the curvature of the handle, the way that you can just imagine the handle rocking in."
"You might not know on which side of the door it's going to open, and you might not know what the words mean, but the picture sure looks like yourself and it seems to be going through it."
But that's sort of cheating.
"Just the physical design of this has been very carefully crafted so that when you look at it, you understand what it's going to do."
You understand that you need to push on it.
"And this is a type of thing that we do just throughout the day, constantly, where you encounter stuff and you have to look down and say, I'm going to push on that."
"It's just this kind of thing that cognitively, you're just constantly doing without really even thinking about it."
I guess we haven't done enough generally to allow different ways for people to be able to participate.
Natalie:
"And right now the roles in the community, theres not that many, theres some different ones but its a small subset so we're trying to think how can there be more roles or people can opt in to taking on more of a role."
Because we do see that in these after school programs and also in the online community.
That can be really motivating and helping people develop and want to actually have an authentic role.
Avi:
"I think part of that and it relates to questions that people asked, so how do you work to promote motivation in really constrained environments where for example teachers have to teach for the standardized test or with a very closed curriculum."
And I think that the idea again is 1.
There are no recipes but the principles are the same.
So what you do is you analyze and its all working with tensions.
And the idea is you analyze the tensions in your particular environment with your particular people.
Who are the people around here?
What are their complex motivations?
"The more you know about your context and your constraints, the better you will be able to say how can I apply the principles of motivation in this particular context and then you apply it and then you study it again."
And you see what the effect you had and you read redesign and its an iterative process in a complex environment with a complex process that is unpredicatable really.
"But you can actually, using the principles you can anticipate they will move a particular direction."
Natalie:
"Yes, that great."
Fred Bartels has an example.
Some other people have talked about how they've done some compromises between these two things based on their environment and like you said iterate it.
So its great to look back at that.
Mitch:
"So I think we need to wrap up now, at least for me , the hour flew past."
There were lots of really interesting topics and ideas that came up so maybe just I'll say a few words now about
looking ahead.
"But first of all, I really want to thank Avi for joining us and participating."
It was great to hear your points of view on these ideas and I think it will stir up lots of continuing conversations about these ideas.
Avi:
My pleasure.
Mitch:
"Looking ahead, actually we aren't going to be meeting for the next two weeks because there are various events here at MlT."
"Actually theres a Massachusetts holiday next week, Patriot's Day when the Boston Marathon is run so we won't be holding class next Monday."
It's a stupid world.
"Let's go back to the beginning, OK, to the very first browser and the very first server."
"Initially they were both on the same machine, but eventually they figured out how to put a wire between them, and that was a good thing, that's when it started to get interesting."
"Pretty quickly you get to the point where you've got so many browsers trying to attack one server that one server can't do it anymore, so we had to start thinking about how we're going to scale."
"Historically what we did was put a distributor in front of the servers, so each request that comes in can route either at random or round robin or least loaded, whatever policy you want."
The message goes somewhere else and that server deals with it.
Then you've got a database in the back that they can all share.
The database becomes a problem -- that becomes a bottleneck.
"Initially everybody was using some kind of relational database there, which I think was a really bad fit for this."
The relational database was developed at IBM back in the mainframe era to solve a completely different class of problems than we have here.
"But there were a lot of people who understood how they worked, and understanding how they work means you don't have to rethink anything, so great, we'll just take that and put it in."
And they didn't scale.
"So in the decades since then, we've done a lot of things — figuring out how to shard them and do other stuff -- and in doing that you break the relational model, so most of the goodness you got from that model you don't get any more."
"But at least you don't have to rethink anything, OK, so"
life continues.
"But at some point even that doesn't work, so you start looking for other options."
"People have come up with no SQL databases, which are wonderful."
I love these things.
There's
"Mongo, and Couch, and all the others."
They're great.
"People are kind of going back and changing the assumptions, and going what's really important here?"
The important thing often is scalability.
"You're going to trade off a lot of other things in order to get that, and we're getting it, so that's really good."
It turns out Yahoo!'s been doing this for a long time.
"We had a massive home grown no SQL database introduction here since 1996, so we've been doing this for a long time too."
It's wonderful stuff.
But now let's put Ajax on top of all of this.
This model was not designed for Ajax.
"This was something that we kind of figured out after the fact that we could do, and it's not optimal for us."
The biggest problem is: where does the server put its state?
"Because this model assumes that it's stateless, so that any request can go to any server."
"What it is it's sort of like charismatic power - being likable, having a charm factor, being respected highly, being looked up to for who you are, for you integrity, for the way you think, for the way you're cool and calm and rational, and you're cooperative and collaborative, and you just have these characters that people admire."
You're actually going to see this in some of your assignments.
Maybe you'll see it in groups you belong to.
You know people like this.
"Everybody follows them because they seem to know how to act, but also their ideas are pretty good, and they just set such a good example by the way they are."
"The third type of power, we tend to use it too much, it's called expert power."
"You know it's having the answers, having some knowledge, bringing knowledge in from our past."
We have the answers because we've done this before.
"You know, every group needs expert power."
"You need people who are veterans who have some experience, so they can bring it to the group as long as it's not overdone or telling the group what to do or the know-it-all."
You've got to be real careful about overusing expert power.
"Let the group sort of make its decisions, bringing ingredients in appropriately as an information giver, as we talked about that role, rather than trying to control outcomes by overusing expert power to sway a group toward something you think is best."
The fourth of these types of power is called reward power.
"Now, reward power is the ability to give people something, some kind of perks."
"Maybe, ""I'll bring refreshments next time, again."""
"And everybody says, ""Ah, I love that."""
Maybe you're a good cook; you can bake something.
"I was in a Bible study once, and it was a men's Bible study, a bunch of farmers six in the morning, and we all took turns."
It was such a cool thing.
There was a reward there though.
"It was almost like, you brought the cookies, you brought the baked goods, cinnamon rolls, and you made the coffee, and everybody took turns giving perks, and it was all sort of a cool thing."
"If you've every been in a group, maybe somebody in the group says,"
"""Alright if we succeed in this, I'll buy everybody dessert at Applebee's after the meeting if we can figure this out by nine o' clock."""
"So, if there is some reward power everybody is on task."
They want this to happen.
"And the next of these, the fifth type of power, is what we call coercive power, where we punish people."
"We don't like somebody's idea, so we try to embarrass them."
We try to criticize them; we try to shut them down.
We try to get them to be quiet.
And those are not good things.
"And this is where gate keeping comes in, so we don't allow people to misuse gate keeping to quiet down people while letting other people talk more."
And the last of these is persuasive power.
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
It was deemed impossible.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
"The human form, in particular the human head, has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry."
"The project came back to us about a decade later, and this time with a director named David Fincher."
"Now, Fincher is an interesting guy."
"David is fearless of technology, and he is absolutely tenacious."
"And David won't take ""no."""
"And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry, that anything is possible as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money."
"And so David had an interesting take on the film, and he threw a challenge at us."
He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor.
It happened to be this guy.
"We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors."
"That was one idea: that we would have different actors, and we would hand off from actor to actor."
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
"We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up, particularly in close-up."
And makeup is an additive process.
You have to build the face up.
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character.
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.
"So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor."
Sounded great.
"Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly."
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.
There were two studios involved:
Warner Brothers and Paramount.
"And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course, but it was a very high-risk proposition."
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ...
"But despite our verbal assurances, they wanted some proof."
"And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin."
And we did it in about five weeks.
And if you get it early enough.
"Why, that's a remarkable change in the time course of the disease, if you can stop it from progressing."
The way to stop it from.
Progressing early enough is either to have a very good neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.
Or to have a so called bio marker.
"That is an objective measurement either bio chemical or physiological that tells you, yes this person has very early stage Alzheimer's without a doubt."
Now we are not far along on either of those challenges.
Some of the new data suggest that.
"If you take measurements of the tau, remember the tau protein, and phosphorilated tau, and of a beta 42."
"And look at the individual, values, or the ratios among these."
"You can get a fairly early diagnosis, of Alzheimer disease."
"Another, fruitful approach, has just been approved by the FDA, the US Food and Drug Administration."
"It's a molecule, called Florbetapir."
It seems to bind to amaloid plaques that contain beta APP.
Here's the structure and here is the F18.
"Which emits beta particles, that's why it's called Florbetapir."
"So here is a typical positron emission tomography. a person who, does not have Alzheimer 's disease."
"Very few plaques, very few places, plaque places for Florbetabir to bind."
"Here's a person who, by other criteria, does have Alzheimer's disease."
"Clearly, there is a lot more binding, of Florbetapir."
"So, one needs to be extremely careful about these scans, as they're called."
And here are the words that the manufacturer uses.
A negative scan.
"Sparse to no neuritic plaques, inconsistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the time the image is made."
So probably that patient does not have Alzheimer's disease.
"Since the patient goes to a neurologist in the first place for cognitive impairment among other complaints, then that cognitive impairment is not Alzheimer's."
"Now, of course, one needs to be very careful and say that a positive scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid plaques."
And that some patients with these kinds of plaques also have Alzheimer's.
But.
"There are examples of people with other types of neurological conditions, as well as older people with normal cognition who show positive scans."
"So, the manufacturer says very carefully, Florbetapir is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations."
"More than this, we can't say at the moment."
So if we multiply this matrix times-- let's call this vector x.
"This is x1, x2, all the way down to xn, what is this going to be equal to?"
So this is vector x right here.
"So if I multiply matrix I, my identity matrix, I sub n, and"
"I multiply it times my vector x, where x is a member of Rn, has n components, what am I going to get?"
"Well, I'm going to get 1 times x1 plus 0 times x2 plus 0 times x3 plus 0 times x4, all of that."
"So essentially, I'm going to have-- you can kind of view it as this row dotted with the vector."
So the only nonzero term is going to be the 1 times the x1.
"So it's going to be x1-- sorry, let me do it like this."
So you're going to get another vector in Rn like that.
"And so the first term is that row essentially being dotted with that column, and so you just get x1."
"And then the next entry is going to be this row, or you could view it as the transpose of this row dotted with that column, so 0 times x1 plus 1 times x2 plus 0 times everything else."
"So the only nonzero term is the 1 times x2, so you get an x2 there."
"And then you keep doing thatt, and what are you going to get?"
You're going to get an x3 because the only nonzero term here is the third one and you're going to go all the way down until you get an xn.
But what is this thing equal to?
This is just equal to x.
"So the neat thing about this identity matrix that we've created is that when you multiply it times any vector, you got the vector again."
The identity matrix times any vector in Rn-- it's only defined for vectors in Rn-- is equal to that vector again.
"And actually, the columns of the identity matrix have a special-- I guess the set of columns has a special name."
"So if we call this first column e1 and this second column e2 and the third column e3 and we go all the way to en, these vectors, these column vectors here, the set of these-- so let's say e1, e2, all the way to en-- this is called the standard basis for Rn."
So why is it called that?
"Well, the word basis is there, so two things must be true."
These things must span Rn and they must be linearly independent.
It's pretty obvious from inspection they're linearly independent.
"If this guy has a 1 here and no one else has a 1 there, there's no way you can construct that 1 with some combination of the rest of the guys."
And you can make that same argument for each of the ones in each of the components.
So it's clearly linearly independent.
"And then to see that you can span, that you can construct any vector with a linear combination of these guys, you just really have to-- you know, whatever vector you want to construct, if you want to construct x1-- let me put it this way."
If you want to construct this vector-- let me write it this way.
Let me pick a different one.
"Let's say you want to construct the vector a1, a2, a3 all the way down to an."
Already in the early grades?
Ole:
"Yes, and then let the individual find out for themselves how to formulate the problem and how to answer it"
Martin:
So a careful introduction to existentialism?
"Ole: and identity politics,yes that wouldn't be so bad and then as the next exercise ""Who are you""? that one's not that easy, is it? we live a life with each other based on qualified guesses, right? which in a sense is tragic, right?.. but on the other hand it's very good that we can't look into each other's consciousness"
Martin:
"So the ""Who are you"" project, might start a dialogue and that wouldn't be so bad?"
"No, and dialogue has also been found in Norwegian experiments at different grade levels that dialogue Capacity and the development of it, it promotes a huge amount of skills in other subjects"
"It's like music .. music is a dialogue, right?"
Ole: it's just on another level.
Martin:
Music is the best..
Martin:
"I have an old plan to combine singing, dancing and fighting because it is the oldest culture all expressions and there must be a formation of dealing with that in some abstract synthesis"
"But we can not really get around culture, can we?"
Foundation of culture if we are to be humans.
Ole:
We can not!
Martin:
"And if you look at how the media is today as the cultural subjekts is starved, right?"
To some extend.
Ole:
Yes it is..
Martin:
If you look away from it completely popped
Ole:
"Yes yes and the unified but culture is the participation so that requires the interaction it is not a spectator role that's why I enjoy amateur music and dance so much and in fact also the fight, right because it is integration, integration you have to take part, you should not be excluded, you shouldn't just sit and stare"
You must have all the senses involved and all the bodily
"I also made another word in my doctoral thesis which I called ""Synkinestesi"""
"See, in neurobiologists the senses deputize each other, not."
"""I can taste how you look"" or ""I can hear how the tree is"" but forKinesis you get movement with in and movement embraces everything in psychology it is called proprioception which is the sense of your own body and it is the feeling that, as in a probe moves you through the world and then it's the movement that brings together all your senses and the movement expressed in dance, in battle and in the music, right"
Sal thank you very much from the Khan Academy.
Sal:
Thank you.
Tom:
And you and I will get together later and see if we can improve my math skills.
Thank you.
This is a Web Archiving Service tutorial video that will show you how to conduct an XML metadata export.
There are two different options for exporting as an XML file.
The first method can provide you with the document of all of your files.
"To complete an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Project Admin"" page, which is found under the ""Administration"" tab."
"Here you find a link to the XML metadata export page, in the list of reports."
"Once you are on the XML Metadata Export page, you may choose whether you would like to export all of your files, or just your publicly available files."
"Click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
The second option for exporting as an XML file allows you to create a limited list of files for export.
"To create an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Manage Sites"" page, which is found under the ""Sites"" tab."
"Once you are on the ""Manage Sites"" page, you can use the limits on the right side of the screen to narrow the results that are displayed."
"For example, you might choose to only display items that have been captured since a particular date."
"After creating a limited list, select the items that you are interested in exporting, and then scroll to the bottom of the page."
"Click on the link that says ""Get XML Metadata Export for selected."""
This link takes you to the same
"""XML Metadata Export"" page where you were able to choose whether you would like to include all of the items you selected, or just the publicly available ones."
"Again, click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
"Choosing between these two XML Metadata options is dependent on whether you are interested in creating a brand-new list, or whether you are updating a previously created list."
The document created from the XML Metadata Export is a raw XML file.
You will need to convert the file to make it functional in your local system.
Feel free to use your local tools for this.
WAS provides a generic MarcEdit XSL stylesheet that can be installed to produce basic MARC records from the XML report.
You will still need to customize the XSL stylesheet to fit the needs of your institution.
"Further information can be found by clicking on the ""Help"" link and choosing ""XML Site Report."""
"This document provides a description of all of the fields in the XML report, as well as a link to the previously mentioned"
XSL crosswalk for MarcEdit.
This has been a Web Archiving Service video tutorial on how to conduct an XML metadata export.
"The solution for me, is back again to the government, because the people, most of the people here, already agree about the garbage separation or the recycle, all the slogans, like ""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" or ""Bali go clean and green""."
Everyone already agrees on those slogans.
"But what we're talking about now is after the slogan, or after the the idea, something that you wrote, the words you have to do the action right now, right?"
"So what we're waiting for now, we as the grassroots movement, or the people still doing what we believe it, what we're waiting for is the government law to support this action."
"To institute that change on such a massive scale, wow, I mean, the government needs to intervene, and it needs to intervene from the top all the way down to the village."
"Every level, you know, and the way, with regional autonomy in Indonesia, ya, the Governor can say it should be like this, but then the Bupatis need to follow suit."
They need to care; they need to really care.
"I think now the government still doesn't have any serious concern about the garbage but I do believe, especially the Balinese"
"local government, because government in Bali is quite unique, we have a formal government and an informal government, and they are both equally strong, 50-50."
"So if both these governments had a really serious concern about the garbage or waste issue, it would be socialized effectively in the public."
"We, people here, would support 100%."
So make it real.
"""Refuse plastic bags, refuse plastic bags, plastic, plastic, plastic, refuse plastic bags."
"Bali is a beautiful island, plastic bags are giving it a scaly skin,"
"Let's play music, and support a beautiful Bali without plastic."""
(Off camera) What is a social worker?A social worker is really what I call an Agent of Change
A change agent.
And that is so important to understand the distinction.
When you look at a patient.
The doctor sees the patient.
The doctor doesn't see anything else but the patient and inside the patient.
The social worker does not just see the patient.
The social worker sees family.
The community at large.
The resources within the community.
And deals with all of them.
That is your change agent.
Because we do not focus on one thing.
We focus on the entirety.
And you really can't cure anything without looking at at the entirety.
If you only work on the one individual someone with mental illness or the senior... what about what comes with the senior?
"Well there's finances, there's there's housing, there's family issues, there's all these other issues."
Shit!!
"Well done, with your stupid make-up!"
"Ah, well done, really, well done!"
"Hey, don't start!"
"See what you've done, you?"
"Oh, look at that now!"
"I've got you, you've got me, by the beard; the first one of us to laugh will get a slap"
Are you crazy?
I didn't laugh
Yes you did!
But I haven't done anyhting
Dishonesty!
"What's wrong with you, are you insane?"
"What, you got some complaints?"
"But that's almost a punch in the face, not just a slap!"
"Ah but that's normal, if you laugh hard you get a huge slap"
What?
I get a huge slap?
I get a huge slap?
"After World War II with most of Europe in ruins, tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States."
It was clear that the next global superpower required the ability to both launch and successfully defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles.
"In North America, the most vulnerable point of attack was over the North Pole."
"So in 1958, a joint effort between United States and Canada was established, known as NORAD, or North American Aerospace Defence Command."
An important line of defence was the semi-automatic ground environment.
It was an automated system of over 100 long distance radars scattered across North America.
They were connected to computerized radar stations that transmitted tracking data using telephone lines or radio waves.
"All of this radar information was fed into a primary warning center, buried a mile deep inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado."
This application of machine to machine communication allowed operators to make split-second decisions using information transmitted and processed automatically by computers.
"This idea of being ""online"" was quickly adapted and advanced by universities in the following years, as they understood the potential of computer networking."
"The thing that makes the computer communication network special is that it puts the workers, that is the team members who're geographically distributed in touch, not only with one another, but with the information base with which they worked all the time, and this is obviously going to make a tremendous difference in how we plan, organize, and execute almost everything of any intellectual consequence."
"If we get into a mode in which everything is handled electronically, and your only identification is some little plastic thing you stick into the machinery, that I can imagine that they want to get that settled up with your bank account just right now, and put it through all the checks, and that would require a network."
Money transfers were just one of a growing number of applications which required encryption to remain secure.
"You could have this circle right over here, so you see clearly that two points are not enough"
You need three points.
"Three points lead to a triangle, which leads to a unique circle"
So that by itself is kind of cool
Now another question is if I have a circle
And if it circumscribed about an arbitrary triangle is the center of that circle necessarily the circumcenter?
So let's think about that a little bit because there are some non-intuitive cases here.
"So if I draw a circle right over here, its center is right over there, and if I draw an arbitrary triangle where all of the vertices of that triangle are on this circle, is this center necessarily the circumcenter of that triangle?"
So let me draw a crazy situation
Let me draw one where this thing is clearly outside of the triangle.
So we could have one that looks like this and clearly all three vertices sit on the circle.
"So you might first say, wait, there's no way this could be the circumcenter, it's not even inside the triangle."
"But remember, this point right here is equidistant to every point on the circle."
"I should say, every point on the circle is equidistant from this point."
They're all a radius away.
And all three points of this triangle are on the circle
So they are all exactly a radius away from this point right over here.
"So this distance is going to be a radius, this distance right over here is going to be a radius, and this distance right over here is going to be a radius"
"Now, this point is clearly equidistant from that point and that point."
We know that.
It's exactly R away from both of those vertices of the triangle
"So if it's equidistant, and we proved this in a previous video, if it's equidistant from both of those points, it must be on the perpendicular bisector of the segment that joins those two points"
So this must be on the perpendicular bisector.
"So that's perpendicular, and it bisects that segment right over there."
But we can make the same argument for this segment right over here. because this point is R from the center
"We're going to call it point 0, I'm tired of just calling it ""this point"" point O is equidistant from"
"Let me label these, so let's call this A, B, C."
So we already said point O is equidistant from
"C and B, so it must be on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and it's also equidistant from A and B"
It's R away from both because
A and B both sit on the circle they are both a radius away from the center
So it also must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and B.

Sadhguru:
"When you are unable to hear what somebody else is saying, your relationships will go bad."
(Laughs)
"In many ways, the fundamentals of your relationship is, you are willing to listen to the other person, isnt it?"
Hum?
"If you want to say everything, there will be no relationship."
"Relationships, for most of you the way you are right now, the quality of your relationship"
largely decides the quality of your life.
Is that so?
Hum?
The quality of relationships that you hold in your life
largely decides the very quality of life that you live.
"So, when it is playing such an important role in your life,"
I think it needs to be looked at.
So what is the basis of a relationship?
Why do human beings need a relationship first of all?
"Relationships are formed on different levels, various types of relationships, to fulfill different types of needs."
"The needs may be physical, psychological, emotional, social, financial, political, it could be any kind."
"But to fulfill various needs within a human being, relationships are established on different levels."
"Whatever the nature of the relationship, whatever the type of relationship, still the fundamental aspect is you have a need to fulfill."
"No I have nothing to get, I want to give."
"Giving is also as much a need as receiving, isnt it?"
Yes?
"But raising them, of course we should raise them."
The problem is that the current system of education was designed and conceived and structured for a different age.
It was conceived in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.
And in the economic circumstances of the Industrial Revolution.
"Before the middle  of the 19th century, there were no systems of public education."
Not really.
"I mean, you could get educated by Jesuits, you know, if you had the money, but public education,  paid for from taxation, compulsory to everybody and free at the point of delivery, that was a revolutionary idea."
And many people objected to it.
"They said it's not possible for many street kids, working class children, to benefit from public education."
"They're incapable of learning to read and write, and why are we spending time on this?"
"So, there's also built into it a whole series of assumptions about social structure and capacity."
"It was driven by an economic imperative of the time, but running right through it was an intellectual model of the mind."
Which was essentially the Enlightenment view of intelligence.
"That real intelligence consists in this capacity for a certain type of deductive reasoning, and the knowledge of the classics, originally."
What we've come to think of as academic ability.
"And this is deep in the gene pool of public education, that there are really two types of people: academic and non-academic; smart people and non-smart people."
"And the consequence of that is that many brilliant people think they're not, because they've been judged against this particular view of the mind."
"So, we have twin pillars, economic and intellectual."
And my view is that this model has caused chaos in many people's lives.
It's been great for some.
There have been people that have benefited wonderfully from it.
But most people have not.
Instead they suffer this.
"This is the modern epidemic, and it's as misplaced, and it's as fictitious."
This is the plague of ADHD.
"Now, this is a map of the instance of ADHD in America, or prescriptions for ADHD."
"Don't mistake me,"
I don't mean to say there is no such thing as Attention Deficit Disorder.
I'm not qualified to say if there is such a thing.
"I know that a great majority of psychologists, and pediatricians think there is such a thing."
But it's still a matter of debate.
"What I do know, for a fact, is it's not an epidemic."
"But, of course, that only happened because there were occasions when the Mongols did slaughter entire towns."
"So, with all that background,"
let us return to the question of Mongol awesomeness.
"First, 5 arguments for awesome:"
1.
The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian trade.
"The Silk Road trading routes that had existed for about 1,000 years by the time the Mongols made the scene, had fallen into disuse, but the Mongols valued trade, because they could tax it, and they did a great job of keeping their empire safe."
"It was said that a man could walk from one end of the Mongol empire to the other, with a gold plate on his head, without ever fearing being robbed."
2.
"The Mongols increased communication, through Eurasia, by developing this pony express-like system of way stations, with horses and riders that could quickly relay information."
"It was called the Yam System and it also included these amazing bronze passports, which facilitated travel."
3.
Another thing that travelled along Mongol trade routes was cuisine.
"For example, it was because of the Mongols that rice became a staple of the Persian diet, which I mention entirely because I happen to like Persian food."
4.
"The Mongols forcibly relocated people who were useful to them, like artists, and musicians, and, especially, administrators."
"As you can imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative tasks,"
"like keeping records, so they found people who were good at that stuff and just moved them around the empire."
"This created the kind of cross-cultural pollination that world historians, these days, get really excited about."
And 5.
"The Mongols were almost, unprecedentedly, tolerant of different religions."
"They themselves were shamanists, believing in nature spirits, but since their religion was tied to the land from which they came, they didn't expect new people to adopt it, and they didn't ask them to."
"So you could find Muslims and Buddhists and Christians, and people of any other religion you can think of, prospering throughout the Mongol empire."
"And, it's that kind of openness that has led historians to go back and re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as a precursor to modernity."
"But there is another side of the story that we should not forget, so here are 5 reasons why the Mongols might not be so great:"
1.
Here is Genghis Khan's definition of happiness.
"""The greatest happiness is to vanquish"
"""your enemies, to chase them before you,"
"""to rob them of their wealth,"
"""to see those dear to them bathed in tears,"
"""to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."""
It's right here...
To be precise:
"Right there, in Espalha Brasas, ..."
"Lisbon, of course."
"- I believe, wherever you are in Europe, you're at the centre."
- This is a restaurant that is based on simple and traditional Portuguese cuisine.
- We have had a tradition for centuries:
The codfish... ... dried in the sun with salt.
And some centuries ago that would be the way to keep it all year long.
And that would be the food for most Portuguese who could not afford something else.
- I think Lisbon is the centre of Europe... ...
"With the internet you have no boundaries, we have the weather and the nice people, so we can conquer the world."
"There is a challenge in terms of culture, because we don't have a very entrepreneurial culture."
- The centre of Europe is right where you are.
Our signature is:
'Ideas that happen'.
"So it's not only having the ideas, but also the possibility of making them happen."
I started a house of the entrepreneurs.
"It's a place where entrepreneurs can get the resources they need, the people they need, the support they need."
"- The centre of Europe is split between our heritage, common culture and our hearts."
"Especially with what I call the ""natural dances"","
"like Argentinian tango, salsa... , where you have actually true improvisation, you add another element to the mix."
"And that is that besides the interpretation of the music, you also have the combination with your partner, in a free way, where from simple mechanics you create all these things that you see."
- I think the centre of Europe is where the soul and heart of Europe is.
It took several years to convince Portugal that it was worthwhile to invest in artificial intelligence.
"And also because Portugal did not have a very good image in technology abroad, it was also very difficult for us to convince customers in other countries to go ahead with us."
"Of course it's also very difficult for a computer to have the intelligence to cope with complexity, and that's where artificial intelligence comes in:"
To take better advantage of the resources of the company.
"And that was the main goal for Siscog, our company that develops software for the transportation domain."
"- In internet, you should take advantage of when you have the attention of the customer, to make him perform an action."
"In offline, it's difficult because the media and the action are separate things."
"You see TV, and then you go to the shops."
Now these assumptions are captured in a table I have on my document camera.
"What I have here are five firms, just calling them A,B,C,D, and, and E. Each of these five firms is emitting five units of pollution."
And each has a different call structure in the eliminating or the abating of the units of pollution.
"For example firm A, incurs a cost of $100 dollars. incurs a marginal cost of $100 to eliminate the first unit of pollution."
"Then it incurs $200 for the second, $400 for the third, $800 and $1600 for the fifth."
B. Has a higher cost structure.
"B, incurs $200 in cost to abate the first unit."
"It's $600, $1800, $5400, and, and so on."
I hope you get.
"Now, let's suppose the government comes in and regulates this environment, this geographical location and it tells produces that they can not emit more than two units of pollution."
"Well, that means that each fund is basically given."
"Two rights, two pollute there is a standard equal to the to the stash a line firms must incur the cause of the clean up for all units of pollution prior to this a dash line.Now this means,that firm A must clean up three units which is one hundred plus two hundred plus four hundred which is $700."
"Firm B must incur these three costs or 200+600, that's 800 and $2600."
Firm C incurs these costs which add up to $1200.
"And firm D, that's 2000, $3000."
And firm
"E, well that's $6000 there."
"Firm E is a very high cost pollution abater, cost firm"
E a great deal.
"In this table what I have done is taken, transfered the costs at each firm is going to have to Per, to abate the, the required three units of pollution."
"And the total cost is $13,500."
In contrast to requiring each firm to clean up three units of pollution.
"What the government might do is simply, say that there are ten pollution rights."
"And, firms can bid for these pollution rights."
"In order to emit a unit of pollution, they must bid for these, these rights. say, made, made out in, in tickets or licenses."
"And if they do, we know that, they're going to bid based on their cost structure."
"We go back to our, our table."
"Well lets suppose that the cost of a ticket is only $50, that is the initial price at the auction is only $50."
Well how many units of these pollution rights is A going to want?
"Well A would prefer to pay $50 for a pollution right, then to incur even the, The cost, the low cost of even abating the first unit of pollution, so A is gonna want five tickets, and of course if A wants five tickets at fifty buck, B is gonna want to buy five tickets."
It's cheaper to buy the pollution rates than to incur all of these costs.
"Well, you can imagine that as you go through this table that all five firms are gonna want five tickets."
(Gravelly)Not if Swagron has anything to say about it!

Thanks Franz.
My name is Vincent Vanhoucke.
I work on the speech technology team here at Google and I thought I'd try to share with you a single piece of insight that we gain from working on speech technology at Google Scad.
"And that can be summarized basically as such and if you want to get a shot at super-human performance of machinery, maybe the first thing you should try and do is get rid of the humans."
(audience chuckles)
"So, you might be questioning my premise already."
"You might be wondering, ""[He's] talking about super-human speech recognition here."
"And we all know that speech recognition is not at human performance yet."""
The problem is that it's getting dangerously close.
Let me just give you an example.
Imagine- so one of the products is voice search so you can just speak to the search engine and we'll look for it.
You can just talk to it.
"So imagine you can just talk to your phone, you can record that prompt and then we play it back either to yourself or we'll play it back to the speech recognition engine we find in research, okay?"
And we ask for the transcription.
There is no question at this point that you will do a much better job than the speech recognition engine at recognizing your own speech.
The picture changes when if you actually change this up and play the audio to a naive human.
"By naive human, I mean someone who doesn't know you, who doesn't necessarily have the same cultural references as you have, who doesn't necessarily live in the same neighborhood, who doesn't have the same context, then, it actually becomes a toss-up."
If you just play it once to a user and ask them to transcribe it and they will do almost no better than speech recognition.
"So, why is that?"
"Roughly, without going into details, speech recognition is too complex."
There's an acoustic model and an English model.
The acoustic model is what recognizes the sounds and we're not really at human performance yet in acoustic modeling.
"In fact, the fidelity is not yet at the level of a native human speaker."
"But we have this language model, and the language model is what predicts what words you are saying and which order you you are going to say."
"We train similar to machine translation, huge!"
On huge corpuses
We train on 240 billion words for voice search and that gives us an edge that a single user might not have.
I can't believe this is happening.

Could we learn from Norway?
Ole:
Ehrm ..
I've actually been working together with Norway.
Seen cultural cooperation with..
"""Nord Trøndelag"" it's called where they have jazz festivals and where they work with art and business certainly, but also the schools that are around in the villages totally worn out"
"Norway don't always use there oil money in the right way, I would say .. but some things we can learn from Norway"
"In particular, we could learn modesty of Norwegians"
Norway has the largest number of middle managers who do not want to be leaders but I like the Norwegians because they remain committed to their values
I have stayed in a folk dance farm up in Norway which was organic awarded in Norway very special..
They made the costumes and danced under the midnight sun
It was very cozy.
I also have a stringed instrument
Martin:
Yes you play the violin and viola..
Ole:
Yes!
This gives rise to ... and that's a leading question ..
Is it something that gives perspective to all this philosophy?
Ole:
"Well, first it's a good way to get thinking as music affects your mentality"
Martin:
Sherlock Holmes also enjoyd it
Ole:
"Yes, but it's proven with children and so on that in music, at least, classical music because of its mathematical structure you become more gifted by playing and wierd enough .."
"If you have thought a lot in a period you will also be better at playing but generally yes, music is incredible"
"Especially classical music for ... especially Bach who is fabulous but the entire Danish culture is far down the road built on societies and associations and in music clubs, it was the amateur music which has been an excellent element in creating precisely those things that you're talking about because of democracy, in spite of lack of skills and abilities you have been allowed join in anyway"
Martin:
"But then we're back to Peideia, the bourgeois formation included music, cause it was good in developing people into good people"
I also think it has something to do with the nobility.
They had so much time and could do what they thought was fun and what gave them the most and it was to ride and fencing and paint watercolors speak French and of course play music and they would not go down as modern nobility does today with drugs and self-pity because the transcendental activities built them up as human beings rather than take them down

"*Sheik Sadeg Al Gheryani, Tripoli*"
"In the name of God the merciful, praise be to God the creator of the universe and peace be upon our prophet and his people and all who were guided by his guidance"
"I have been asked, from within the country, from our cities, Misrata and Tripoli and other Libyan cities to clarify what the Libyan people should do in this current situation, in these difficult times."
"I say that what Gaddafi's security brigades are doing in their violent, deliberate indiscriminate attacks on Libyan cities can only make hearts break and is scarcely to be believed"
"The Libyan people, who began their uprising peacefully asking for their rights and still want it to be peaceful, even though the regime has forced them to take up arms the Libyan people must now bear their responsibility."
"In the following way: in the liberated cities, the people must continue to go out in protests to call for their rights and to stress the unity of the country, and to support the countries which have declared their support for the Libyan people, and condemn those countries which have taken an opposing position, and those who are still in the position of spectators, especially the Arab nations must be urged to take a position."
Libyan ex patriot communities must also take on this role.
"In European countries, in Arab countries, in front of embassies."
Because international movement is connected to the popular movement.
"Let's say that I place some textbooks on top of this table, or box, just to make the drawing simpler."
Let's say I place a box there.
"Let's say the box weighs 10 kilograms, which would be about 100 Newtons."
So let's say it weighs about 100 Newtons.
"So what I want to figure out, what I need to figure out, is how much weight is being put onto each of the legs of the table?"
"And this might not have even been obviously a moment problem, but you'll see in a second it really is."
So how do we know that?
"Well, both of these legs are supporting the table, right?"
"Whatever the table is exerting downwards, the leg is exerting upwards, so that's the amount of force that each of the legs are holding."
"So what we do is we pick-- so let's just pick this leg, just because I'm picking it arbitrarily."
"Let's pick this leg, and let's pick an arbitrary axis of rotation."
"Well, let's pick this is as our axis of rotation."
Why do I pick that as the axis of rotation?
Because think of it this way.
"If this leg started pushing more than it needed to, the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"Or the other way, if this leg started to weaken and started to buckle and couldn't hold its force, the table would rotate down this way, and it would rotate around the other"
"leg, assuming that the other leg doesn't fail."
We're assuming that this leg is just going to do its job and it's not going to move one way or the other.
"But this leg, that's why we're thinking about it that way."
"If it was too weak, the whole table would rotate in the clockwise direction, and if it was somehow exerting extra force, which we know a leg can't, but let's say if it was a spring or something like that, then the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"So once we set that up, we can actually set this up as a moment problem."
So what is the force of the leg?
"So the whole table is exerting some type of-- if this leg wasn't here, the whole table would have a net clockwise moment, right?"
The whole table would tilt down and fall down like that.
So the leg must be exerting a counterclockwise moment in order to keep it stationary.
So the leg must be exerting a force upward right here.
"The force of the leg, right?"
We know that.
We know that from basic physics.
There's some force coming down here and the leg is doing an equal opposite force upwards.
So what is that force of that leg?
And one thing I should have told you is all of the distances.
Evaluation is that it's still unacceptable.
"And so, you put on another expanded control which is periodic changes to the password."
"Again, simplistic example but it gives you the idea."
"With respect to integrity, you'll remember we had the two, two, and two, which would give us eight."
The decision was to retain it.
"Retain the, the integrity risk. it was, the management decided it was acceptable because there were adequate controls in place."
"With respect to availability, it was a twelve."
The decision was made to treat it by reducing it.
"A couple of controls were put in place, maintain the server hardware periodically, install anti-virus software."
"That brought the level of threat down to oh, actually, maint, maintained the level of threat at three, but brought the level of vulnerability down to a one, so that brought our risk point down to six."
"At that point, it was acceptable, adequate controls were viewed to be in place."
"And this is the kind of thing you can do for every, every, risk that you might, or every asset, information asset in your organization above a certain level."
"And then, you know, you, you, up, you know, in front, at the beginning of the process, users define what the acceptable level of risk is."
"In this case, it was eight."
"So, at the beginning, we had one that was acceptable, and two that weren't."
"After we applied our preventive controls, we still had one that was unacceptable, and so we did something additional and we had two that were acceptable."
"So, that's, that's kind of the process you're going to go through."
Does that make sense to everybody?
"It's a little more simp, more, more straight forward than what you saw with the 800-30."
"It's something you can actually sit down and do, you know?"
"800-30 is almost, you know, a career."
"[laug hs] And that's not to say it shouldn't be used, cuz it's a very, very thorough, very complete, very comprehensive standard."
We went to the campaign head-quarters.
It was very crowded there.
Some people were standing in Mirhadi Street.
"Everyone was very anxious, and wanted to know what was going on."
Some people listened to the radio.
Some spoke of rumors of Ahmadinejad's lead.
Others denied it.
No one knew whether it was true or just rumors destined to undermine our morale.
"But around midnight it was officially declared that five million votes had been counted, out of which Mr. Ahmadinejad had obtained more than 3 million votes."
"Mousavi had one million something, and Mr. Karroubi and Rezaei had obtained very few votes."
That's gonna be hot.
It's nice!
Very savoury but soft!
A little bit different from your normal grain.
"So, I hope you enjoyed your savoury oatmeal dinner, we're gonna have ours put in a plate and topped it off with the avocado and enjoy it here on the roof top in Kas."

In 2007 the crisis in the real-state market spread fast around the world
Millions of people lost their houses and their jobs ?
We are deep in shit and we all know it but we still trust that all is not going to fall apart
Is capitalism destroying itself and
I think that is all splosh
Capitalism
Karl Marx and the critique of Capitalism is undergoing a revival today
To bring Marx's Kapital to the stage is a crazy edeavour
The success of this play is very astonishing for me fully unexpected
The achivement of Capitalism is the limitless capacity or commodities
But how can Marx's criticism of capitalism can help us to gain a better understandig of this crisis?
The question from Marx is not aimed at more critique
From where does all the enthusiasm with everything that has to do with Karl Marx comes?
"In a lot of countries in the West, dealing with your waste, you're kind of separated from it, you put it in the bin and it magically disappears."
"Someone comes, it's all arranged for you."
You don't have to think about it.
"And here, you have to make an extra effort, because there really isn't a system, so you have to think about it."
You're confronted with it.
"So even though there's a really bad problem, there's a positive side, because you're forced to recognize the problem."
You're forced to have to deal with it.
"So looking at that side of it, it's really an opportunity for people to kind of confront their their consumption, their pollution."
"Bali has a problem about every year our coastal, when it's the season once a year, a lot of plastic garbage landed in Kuta coastal."
The government said this is because of the sea tides.
"It's not about the sea tides, from my opinion, it's about people still throw plastic garbage in the river or in the canals and they flow to the ocean, and the ocean will bring it back to the land."
"Waste management is a little bit the land of no one, no?"
"I mean it's a little bit, you can almost do whatever you want without really being caught. / But the garbage problem affects everybody, rich and poor, and if you can't deal with that basic problem- pollution from your waste- then how are you going to deal with these large, more complex problems, like deforestation, destruction of the coral reef, and climate change."
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store... [instrumental and chorus]"
"[rhythmic dripping, haunting melody continues]"
And here we have the result of some simulations of the exploratory agent.
We see it's doing much better than the passive agent or than the Greedy agent.
So I'm graphing here; and we only had to go through 100 trials.
We didn't have to go through 500--so it's converging much faster.
And it's converging to much better results.
"So the policy loss and the dotted lines started off high; but after only 20 trials, it's come down to perfect."
"So it learned the exact, correct policy after 20 trials."
"The error in the utilities--so you can have the perfect policy, while not quite having the right utilities for each state-- and the errors in utility comes down, and that, too, comes down to a level that's lower than the previous agent's-- but still, not quite perfect."
"And we see here that it, in fact, learns the correct policy."
"Now that we have constructed Hilbert spaces and Orthonormal bases, we can see some of their distinguishing features."
"One of them is norm conservation, which is called Parseval's theorem, and is an extension of Pythagoras' famous Orthonormality theorem to infinite dimensions."
"Then, we will see the Orthogonal Projection Theorem."
This is a powerful method to take a vector from possibly an infinite dimensional space and project it onto a subspace.
"Once we have this, we will consider some examples of approximations and orthonormal bases."
Modules 3.3 Hilbert Space and Approximation.
The overview of this submodule is the following.
"First, we look at the norm conservation, in particular Parseval's formula."
"Then, we look at the approximation by the projection method, and finally we explore a few examples."
"Parseval's theorem: we know that if we have a basis for space, any vector x can be written as a linear combination, summed from 0 to K-1, αk, wk."
"For an orthonormal basis, there is this beautiful formula which says that the squared norm of x, ||x|| squared is equal to the sum of the coefficents of expansion squared, or Parseval's formula."
Let us verify Parseval's formula on a simple example.
"We have the canonical basis E, e0 on e1, and we can write x as α0, e0, α1, e1."
"Let us look at the new basis, the blue one, which is given by v0 and v1."
"V0 is equal to cosθ sineθ transpose, v1 is minus sinθ cosθ transpose."
"And x can of course also be written as a linear combination of v0 and v1, namely, β0, v0, plus β1, v1."
"So his model is the Z electrons filled this volume, this sphere effectively of 10^-10 meters in diameter."
"The electrons filled that up, but somewhere in the center there is something that is very small and very massive that has a diameter of 10^-14 meters."
Because occasionally that alpha particle hit that massive part so most of the mass of the atom is in this nucleus.
"Now, isn't this a great UROP project for Mr. Marsden?"
What did he do?
He discovered the nucleus.
Fantastic.
I also want to tell you that this kind of Rutherford backscattering experiment here is also the basis of the experiment that was done to discover the quark.
"The quark which is the elementary particles that make up the proton, the neutron."
Same idea.
There is a high energy particle that comes into the proton and backscatters from the quark essentially.
"That is an experiment carried out by one of my colleagues in the Physics Department, Jerry Friedman and Henry"
Kendall.
Henry Kendall has since passed away.
But the same idea.
It's really the Rutherford backscattering experiment that was done.
All right.
"Well, now it is time for us to do our own Rutherford backscattering experiment."
"And the way we are going to do that is we're going to be scattering off of this lattice here, this lattice of these Styrofoam balls."
"These Styrofoam balls are gold atoms, gold nuclei, and then the space around them is where the electrons are."
So this is one monolayer of gold atoms.
"Now, this scale is a little wrong."
The real scale would be if we had a pinhead in the center of this room and then the rest of the room was the atom and then there would be another room 10-251 with a pinhead in the center of that.
"That's the real scale, but the fact that the scale isn't right, that's okay."
We are going to be able to understand the principle here.
And what we want to do is we want to be able to measure the diameter of these Styrofoam balls or the diameter of those gold nuclei.
And we're going to measure it by measuring the probability of backscattering.
"And the way we're going to measure the probability of backscattering, the way we are going to do that, is we're going to take these ping-pong balls, and they are going to be our alpha particles."
And we are going to aim them at the lattice.
"And we are going to have a total of 287 ping-pong balls, or 287 alpha particles."
"And so the probability of backscattering will be simply the number backscattered over the total number incident, which will be 287."
So this is what we are going to measure.
let's see how that evolves.
"If they can keep an inclusive tone, or if the impulse they've achieved can't be contained and it all splits up."
But it's clear that the motor has been cranked into action.
That's very important.
ST:
And to finish.
What's the future of the 15M?
JL:
"I think the 15M is a state of mind, it's a diagnosis, and it's an inspiration."
"I think nostalgia is a bad travelling companion for the people who have participated in the 15M, because the Puerta del Sol, the Sol camp, is not going to come back."
"The commission of infrastructures is not coming back... at least not in the same terms,"
I don't know if I'm wrong.
But I think it's very hard for all the perfect conditions to come together again for it to happen like before.
"Sometimes you talk to someone who participated very intensely in it and they say that a better world is possible because when they were there, they were hungry and a lady gave them a dish of maccarroni, and then they helped a commission to put up a stand, then they went to see other people camping on the other side of the city to convince them of whatever..."
"And they tell you all these brutal experiences to justify, or as if it could be reproduced permanently all over the world."
"Some people agree with that and have an ideological justification for it, but I'm not going to go into that kind of thing."
But there are people who are attached to that nostalgia.
And we'll have to wait and see how they manage that nostalgia.
And there I see a danger for the 15M.
Or for what the 15M stands for.
"But I insist, it's a diagnosis."
The 15M is a diagnosis.
It's a state of mind and an inspiration and we're still not conscious of the number of projects that it kick-started in May 2011.
"Neurons have been activated amongst groups of friends, amongst of strangers who suddenly met, things like this documentary have been created."
"There are many projects, audiovisual and not, many projects of many different kinds which were created thanks to the inspiration or the motor of the 15M."
And I think those projects are going to lead the way towards the future of the 15M.
"More than just assemblies, more than demonstrations in the street."
It doesn't matter how many are called.
"But I think the projects that arose, inspired by the 15M will be the 15M of the future."
Even if they're not the 15M.
But the spirit will be there in a mystic kind of way. the 15M will experience those projects because they were born there.
"Contact with international media corporations, international perception of the 15M."
"And to trust that even though  sometimes circumstances seem to conspire against us for things not to happen  the way we want to, in fact they actually are  a result of how much effort we put in pursuing our passions, and how we use our  sensitivity to understand other people and to  support each other."
"After all, what is ""to trust""?"
To trust is to not get offended.
Trust is when you are able to...
"Trust is to not get offended, and  allow yourself to give your best, because that is the only way  of having no regrets, so that when your time finally comes,  you will be able to leave this world a much better place  than when you arrived in it."
Thank you!
(Applause)
"So, this is my grandfather,"
"Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table."
He never went back to school.
"Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores."
"Salman was the consummate perfectionist, and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture."
"He was also the ultimate self-learner, and like everything else, he did it in grand style."
"He surrounded himself with an entourage of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka, and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace."
"And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming."
"He fled Germany, together with his family,"
leaving everything else behind.
"His department stores confiscated, he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture."
"This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House."
Such is the power of self-study.
And these are my parents.
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
They were too busy building a family and a country.
"And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong, tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked with thousands of books, records and artwork."
"I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set, then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio."
(Laughter)
"And that's me,"
"I was going to say holding my first abacus, but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad."
(Laughter)
So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach.
"Instead, they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own."
"Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment: these are the virtues of a great education."
"Part of this process is to help people understand that this is possible, and create a demand for it."
"And if there's a demand, then people will take this information and start producing the product, which doesn't exist for the large part for many people."
"Believe me, people ask me, how fast could a transition be made?"
You know what?
In two years this could become the dominant agricultural paradigm.
"All it takes is for Americans to say, this is what I want."
"Because, believe me, there are thousands of small farmers around this country poised, able and ready to scale up."
"But they're not good marketers, they're whatever."
"We're going to talk about that later, some of the really exciting developments that you've encountered, within your local community, is the adoption of internet technology and social networking to allow that transition to occur, to easily sell the product."
"Yes, that's what we're needing to have, is aggregators, that crucial aggregator marketer."
"As I see it, the technology is here, the land is here, the knowledge is here, we just need people that are willing to say, you know what?"
I don't need that Caribbean cruise this year.
I'll take that thousand dollars and I'll buy better food.
And maybe I'll feel better.
"That's what we need, we need people to make that life adjustment, and as that happens it's going to be a good thing."
This is the only herd that we have right now that isn't being mob stocked.
"Because here we just made hay, and we've got all this poultry, so we're trying to just clean a little bit ahead of these, so they're in a pretty big paddock."
The paddock goes from the turkeys over here.
"We're just trying to clean up around the fringes, where the mower couldn't get."
But you get a sense of it.
Some of the grass finished beef here.
"This is what we call ""salad bar beef""."
"Everyday they get a new paddock, yesterday they were over there, today they're here, this afternoon they'll move into that next paddock right there."
"What we're doing here is we're just kind of cleaning up after we made hay, to kind of clean the fringes of the field where the mower couldn't get, and that sort of thing."
"These are grass finished beef, as opposed to grain, and grass-fed, that used to mean the same thing, and now it's become a distinction."
"Kind of like the term ""natural""."
It's been perverted and bastardized.
"Exactly, exactly."
"Grass-fed, the fact is that all cows in the US are grass-fed at some point in their lives."
And then they go into a feedlot for four months.
And it only takes 14 days of grain feeding to chase most of the conjugated linoleic acid out of the body of a ruminant.
"Two weeks and they're at it for four months, in the typical factory farm."
Sorry.
"It looks like I'm not going to get to it, actually."
Thank you.
"What I want you to notice here is that when r goes to infinity, what is the force going to do?"
Zero.
"When those two particles are infinitely far apart, you've got an infinity in the denominator, this force is zero, there is no attraction between them."
"But when r goes to zero, what does that force do?"
Infinity.
"When r is zero, there is an infinity large force."
"And in between, what is happening is that the closer the particles get to each other, the larger the force."
The more attraction there is.
The more they want to be even closer to each other.
All right.
"Now, what this equation is telling me is simply, what is the force of attraction between the nucleus in an electron for a fixed distance r?"
"In other words, if I were holding the electron and the nucleus in my hands at some distance r, that equation would tell me what the force was."
"And you can bet that in order to keep them apart, I would really have to be pulling like this."
You'd feel it.
"But you also know that if you let them go, what would happen is that they would move toward each other."
What this equation does not tell us is how they move toward each other.
It does not tell us how r changes with time.
It doesn't tell us anything about r as a function of time.
"Although we know the force law, we don't know anything from that force law about how those two particles move under influence of that force."
And so what we need is we need an equation of motion.
"And the equation of motion that was known at that time is, of course, Newton's equations of motion, Newtonian mechanics, classical mechanics, the mechanics that governs the motion of all bodies around us that we see easily and astronomical bodies."
"In particular,"
"Newton's second law, F equals ma, this force equals the mass of the particles times the acceleration."
"And, of course, in this acceleration term, well, I think you know what's in there."
"In that acceleration term,"
"let me just write it out, the acceleration then is the change in velocity with respect to time and the velocity is the change in the position r with respect to time."
So we have a second derivative here.
What is in this force law is a way to get r as a function of time under influence of this force.
So we take this force and we substitute it in here and we would be able to solve a differential equation for how those two bodies moved under influence of that force.
"When we see the beautiful in our Buddhist Society, you see the beauty in your partner, you see the beauty in yourself, you see the beauty in our wonderful Prime Minister Mr Howard [laughter]."
What are you
"laughing for, you cynical group?"
[laughter].
You can see the beauty in these things!
"And jee, I mean I wouldn't like to be a Prime Minister."
Would you?
It's a very difficult job.
"So when you start to see the positive parts in these people, you're actually generating the positive emotions such as respect."
"How many people actually have respect for their parents, for their partners, for the people in authority?"
Why do we disrespect our systems?
"Because we've been cultivating those fault-finding negative thoughts in our media, in our newspapers, in our conversations."
No wonder we have a lack of disrespect.
"You know if you ask people in other countries they look at Australia - ""This is a beautiful land."
It's pretty well governed.
"It could be better but could certainly be a lot worse!"" So why don't we have respect for our institutions, why are we so negative?"
"You know if we're so negative with our institutions, we get very negative towards our partners."
"Why is it that in our modern life people have such a hard time finding a life partner, keeping them, sticking with them?"
Because they always find fault with each other.
"And why do people always have lack of self-esteem, getting depression, because they start finding fault with themselves as well."
I'm not good enough.
They're not good enough.
Life's not good enough.
Be careful because that path leads to big depression.
We're actually building up those negative emotions and instead we can build up the positive emotions.
We deliberately look for something in our partner we can respect and love and care for.
"We deliberately look in something in ourselves which we can love and care, respect."
"We deliberately look for something in life which we care about, we love and got passion for."
"And that way, by focusing on that, we're building up, generating, the positive emotions of life."
"And when you start to learn how you can generate those positive emotions, the path becomes clear just how you can have a sort of control of this emotional world of yours."
"You're not just like a rudderless ship, always going through these storms and these calms of the ocean of your emotions, but you can actually have some guidance there, you can generate beautiful emotions."
That's basically just what our whole path of Buddhism is.
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
What was that again? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Two last questions from me, and Vic did a great job on the panel on the mobile Internet a few moments ago."
Would you be willing to opine in your lifetime when mobile-related revenue search might surpass PC-based revenue?
Given that we now know where the future is going? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It clearly will.
It's a question of the growth rate of data-capable mobile devices.
"The reason it clearly will is that the monetization of the ads should be higher, because they're even more targeted."
"So we have a lot of evidence, and Vic talks about this in his speeches, where when you have a powerful browser, whether it's the I-Phone, is a good example, the Blackberry now has one, obviously the Android phones, as they come out."
"People spend many, many more searches when they finally have a capable browser."
"And so one of the things, one of the questions is what's new in the technology sense, as opposed to the financial market sense, and the development of this new, open source browser that all these things are based on, really does create that first step of a whole new platform."
So how long does it take?
"The answer is, a few years."
But not a few decades. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"One last question from me, and then I'll turn it over to others."
You have been a great partner with your revenue-sharing agreements with thousands or millions of other players.
"You don't necessarily get the credit for it that, in my humble opinion, you should."
But you're offering those sorts of compelling deals to content providers.
You're offering an Android operating system to the mobile device market.
"And this goes back, it's the same question, slightly differently, do those offers become more compelling to standouts in the next six to 12 months than they have been in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Do you mean people who have previously said no? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
Yep. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, I think one of the first principles of business is that they say no this year and maybe they'll say yes next year."
We're working really hard to create ecosystems that have enough differentiation and enough innovation that people want to play in them.
"And we're also trying to do business terms that are non-exclusive, so that everybody has access to it."
So there's certainly no prohibition from people doing it.
"In the Android case, it was discussed at the 3GSM conference that there are quite a few partners that have pre-announced their intent to offer Android-based devices of one kind--and some of these things look like phones but some of them are, in fact, not phones."
"And that obviously, then, creates the cycle for more applications."
And that'll bring more people to the party.
"I think people in the room here understand how platform businesses work, and it's fundamentally about momentum."
Photovoltaic on rooftops.
"There will also be, within the structure itself, a composite material."
And when the sun is out the structure moves.
That they call pressure transducers.
They generate electricity by expansion and contraction.
"So all the roadways, all the rooftops are not only photovoltaic, but they are heat concentrators."
"In regions where you have natural volcanic energy, you use the heat of volcanos to boil water and turn turbines."
"And there is enough volcanic energy to propel the Earth for thousands of years, just that alone, if we develop it."
"Harnessing the Gulf Stream, these waters move under the ocean."
"There are cold water streams, there are hot water streams, moving in different directions."
We can harness them by putting a turbine in there.
There are thousands of different ways of generating electricity.
"You don't need oil or gasoline or coal, these are filthy ways."
There is very little waste in the future.
"Today we manufacture things to wear out and breakdown so you have piles of television sets, computers, and cell phones in the junkyard."
Piles of it.
"In the future we design things that last, so you can just change a part very easily by plugging it in and pull out the transistor, put in another one."
It blinks and tells you where the problem is.
Your cell phone will repair itself when it can.
"In other words, the way a machine repairs itself, it has, say, three resistors or transistors, and when one fails the other one rotates and plugs in."
I think machines can do almost anything man can do except feel.
"Mr. Fresco has proposed innovative solutions to many of the environmental issues facing the world, such as the global shortage of clean, potable water."
"When it rains, we harness the water."
We direct the water to storage basins.
"Instead of floods, we build canals all across the world, in different countries."
"And those canals terminate the floodwaters into strip mining, where we dug big holes in the Earth."
We left these ugly places all over the world.
"In the future, we will store floodwaters there to be used at a later date."
We don't pour chlorine in the water.
Do you know that most embalming fluids are in all the reservoirs of all the big cities?
You can't put embalming fluid in dead people and not know that it doesn't go down into the ground and contaminate the water table.
"When you spray poisons on plants, it's very hard to wash those poisons off, because they do go inside the food you eat."
I have to give something to somebody this is also as much a need as I have to receive something.
"So there is a need, whatever kind of need."
"Needs may be diverse, accordingly relationships could be diverse."
"Now, the moment we form a relationship wanting to fulfill a certain need and if that need is not fulfilled then relationships will go bad."
"For whatever purpose for which we have formed a relationship, if those needs and those expectations are not fulfilled, relationships will go bad."
"We may claim many things, but when your expectations are not fulfilled it does go bad, isnt it?"
"So instead of doing too much wishy-washy about it, its best to look at it straight and see what is it and how we need to handle it?"
The needs within a human being have risen because of a certain sense of incompleteness.
People are forming relationships to experience a certain sense of completeness within themselves.
"When you have a good relationship with someone dear to you, you feel complete."
When you dont have that you feel incomplete.
Why is this so?
"Because this life, this piece of life is a complete entity by itself."
Why is it feeling incomplete?
"And, why is it trying to fulfill itself by making a partnership with another piece of life?"
Fundamental reason is that we have not explored this life in its full depth and dimension.
"Though that is the basis, there is a complex process of relationships as such."
"There are expectations, and expectations and expectations and expectations."
(Laughs)
The expectations that most people are creating are such that there is no human being on the planet who could ever fulfill those expectations.
"If you especially this man-woman relationship, the expectations are so much that even if you marry a god or a goddess, they will fail you."
(Laughs)
"Because the expectations are so unrealistic that nobody, no human being can ever fulfill that."
"And unable to understand the expectations or the source of expectations, nobody can fulfill the expectations."
"But if you understand what is the source of this expectation, you could form a very beautiful partnership."
"Are you ok for, you are getting very serious with relationships"
On a certain day
"Jack and Jill now let me use,"
I am trying to just culturally change the joke.

"Jack and Jill were going up the hill,"

And without that health insurance...[cuts off]
When someone is born with a malformed heart valve there's no question we cover the treatment necessary to care for that person.
"Similarly, there should be no question that when someone is born transgender we provide the care they need."
There are clear Standards of Care for treatment of a legitimate diagnosis.
Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria are recognized medical terms &amp;amp; diagnoses.
"I have read one of these exclusionary insurance statements, and it is just appalling."
"Uh, the idea that, uh, it would be, and it is, it's the equivalent of saying"
"""we will not give insurance to short people."""
"You know, it is how you are born."
This is not about cost and benefit.
"This is about the sanctity of human life, and respect for human dignity."
So we cannot sidestep that as we talk about policy.
"Otherwise, [we entrenching ?] a very fundamental core of our value a value of extending liberty and freedom to all of us."
"What we're talking about is a treatment that is medically necessary, as determined by the American Medical Association."
So I'd like to tell you what I believe this issue is really about.
"It's about the American value of equality, and so I say let's live the values of our Constitution: equal treatment under the law."
And I thank the mayor and the council for your support of this issue.
"The American Medical Association to me, for me, has resolved the question by deeming this a medically necessary procedure."
"Uh, based on the briefings I've received,"
"I've also concluded that surgery is not optional, it is actually an appropriate treatment."
"This is a small price to pay for fundamental,uh, helping people to lead happy lives."
We heard several testimony about suicidal considerations.
And I think it's time to end that and to provide the means necessary for people to become the gender they truly believe they are.
When people present me with facts and figures it doesn't override what my heart tells me is the right thing to do.
"And I could not in good conscience allow this city's police officer's to go without health coverage, and I don't feel any different about this issue today."
What was mentioned in testimony is that the suicide rate for transgender people is 33%.
"It seems to me that $32,000 is pretty, um, cost efficient in saving a life."
"And more than that, it's the right thing to do."
"Well I want to thank, uh, Clay Neale [sp?], uh, Jennifer Yoakum [sp?], and Warren Jimenez [sp?]"
Amy Ries [sp?] and Karen Burkes [sp?] on my staff who have all worked on uh this issue over the past 2 1/2 years.
"Again, to our community partner Basic Rights Oregon, to the trans community of Portland who uh each and every day make this city a better place, and it's really my honour and privilege to serve on a City Council where we can bring an ounce of fairness, uh, in return."
"Um, when I put down this gavel, you can clap and cheer."
Is less.
"The time, the, the twin number, The twin on Earth aged during this segment is, indeed, less than the time that, the moving twin aged here."
And the same bi-symmetry is true up there.
"But when you add this extra segment from jumping ships, it's unambiguous the twin on Earth is older."
This is not a contradiction to relativity.
There is a difference between them.
You could measure the difference.
One of them accelerated.
Okay.
So we've cleared up the paradox We understand that the twin that accelerated remained younger and there is not a violation of relativity because you could measure the difference between the two.
"One was inertial, one accelerating."
"Okay, but there is an unsatisfactory feeling to this resolution because what I've essentially done is hidden all my ignorance in this instant of infinite acceleration where instantaneously as seen by the moving twin is."
"Suddenly aged all the difference that makes up the, the, the, for the, for the,"
"Lorentz, the time dilation that he otherwise would have seen."
This infinity doesn't make sense.
Can I do better?
Well of course I can do better.
"What I really wanna do, and in fact, the only physical thing to do, is you can't have infinite acceleration."
You could apply a finite acceleration and you could round off this corner a little bit.
And now I have a story without infinite acceleration.
"You can ask well what happens here? computing here is a little bit more difficult, because now the moving twin is not in an inertial frame."
"The way I cheated before was, that I, he jumped from one inertial frame to another inertial frame."
"And I ignored the acceleration that this implies, now I have to deal with this acceleration."
And that requires a little more calculation then we have.
"But we can get a sense for what this implies, by imagining here's a trick that will cause him to accelerate."
Remember I want him to be moving to the right and then accelerated to the left.
And the way I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna imagine that
"Somewhere out here, I don't know."
Little distance not exactly in the direction it is moving so it isn't crashing there.
But not far from there lies a star a heavy massive object.
"And what I am going to imagine is that as this twin approaches, the star is accelerated and then goes into hyperbolic orbit and is deflected by the star so that he comes back to the earth."
So basically I arrange the angles so that he overshoots the star.
And the real idea is that the fun of this is that it reaches as many students as possible.
"So, when I'm on my deathbed, it would be nice... you know in the for-profit realm a big success would have been IPO or you get acquired."
But here the big success is you can reach millions and millions of kids.
It's pretty exciting.
Tom:
What's the appetite for learning that you're finding from this generation?
"Especially in the difficult sciences like Math, because we know that we're behind in this country."
Sal:
"You know, the really surprising thing is... is my cousins were fairly motivated students, they were having trouble but I was helping them."
"And when I made the videos, I assumed that they would be.. that the appeal would be for people like my cousins or maybe people like myself.."
"I was a pretty good student when I was in middle school, and all the rest."
But the really big surprise: the letters I get are from students who a lot of us would have traditionally labeled as the disengaged students.
The students who said:
"""I was about to fail out of Algebra..."
"I was about to drop out of High School... until I found this type of a resource""."
"And the big message to me is that it's actually a much larger group of students who really, really want to learn and you just have to give them an outlet, so they're not frustrated, so they don't feel that they're being talked down to."
"And if you give them that, it's not just the 5-10% students that want to learn, it's the 90-95%."
Tom:
"Sal, in proceeding panels, as you know, we talked a lot about poverty, socio-economic depravation, people not having access to the internet."
"So are you talking affectively to those who are privileged or, if not elite class, than certainly in the middle to upper middle class?"
Sal:
"You know, across the board, we've seen..."
"Clearly I think the main barrier here is that there is some type of internet connectivity that someone needs to do, but people are already taking our videos, they are being translated into 11 languages, they're putting them onto DVDs."
I've gotten pictures of people using them in rural Africa and rural India.
"So even now, it can be accessed by people anywhere."
"And as we go forward, the cost of technology is just getting cheaper and cheaper and I think that there is some healthy skepticism around technology in the classroom or technology for learning."
And I think the reason that I solved these is because it was nothing to do with technology.
And we're hoping that between our videos - we then we have a huge software platform - to give exercises and feedback to students - that that will be a catalyst to really use technology.
Tom:
What's the difference between teaching online and teaching in the classroom?
Sal:
The classroom management is a little bit easier.
"And since so many communities made this choice independently, it must have been a good choice."
Right?
Even though it meant less music and skoodlypooping.
Thanks Thought Bubble.
"All right, to answer that question,"
let's take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.
Advantage: controllable food supply.
"You might have droughts or floods, but if you are growing the crops and breeding them to be heartier, you have a better chance of not starving."
"Disadvantage: in other to keep feeding people as the population grows, you have to radically change the environment of the planet."
"Advantage: specially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities possible and also the specialization of labor."
"Like, in the days before agriculture, everybody's job was foraging."
And it took about a 1000 calories of work to create a 1000 calories of food.
And it was impossible to create large population centers.
"But if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food."
"Like for instance, trade's people, who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which in turn makes it easier to produce more food more efficiently, which in time makes it possible for a corporation to turn profit on this 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"This is delicious, by the way."
"It's actually terrible, it's very cold."
"And I wish, I had not eaten it."
"I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered?"
"Yeah, thank you."
This is not that.
"Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily beneficial to the planet, or even to its human inhabitants."
"Although, that it is a little of a bit tough argument to make, coming to you as a"
"I am, in a series of ones and zeros."
Advantage: agriculture can be practiced all over the world.
"Although, in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment, like, you know, irrigation, controlled flooding, that kind of thing."
Disadvantage: farming is hard.
"So hard in fact that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans and have to till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities."
So why did agriculture happen?
Wait!
I haven't talked about herders.
"Herders, man!"
Call the number of copies M.
"That is, M, the number of copies, well this is the number of copies N raised to the D power."
"So now, we take the logarithm of both sides and here it doesn't matter what base the logarithm it's to, it will work if you do it Base 10, or Base 2, or the natural log, or whatever you want."
"We can take the log of both sides and then we can solve for D, and now we have our definition of dimension."
"D = log M / log N that is, dimension is the logarithm of the number of copies we get divided by the logarithm of how much we divided the sides by... how much we shrank the side."
Let's check this to make sure it works.
"We have D = log M / log N, and you can think of this as log Base 10 if you like."
"As I said, it doesn't matter what the base is."
"OK, to check it, for Dimension-1, we have the bisecting version where N is 2."
"That is, we divided each line into two equal halves, then M, the number of copies, was two."
"And so D equals log two divided by log two, which equals one (D = log 2/log 2 = 1), so that works because that gives us the dimension, Dimension-1."
"So, for the trisecting version, similarly, we had N equals three (N=3), and we divided the side into three equal parts, and"
"M, the number of copies, was three (M=3), so D equals log three over log three, which again equals one (D = log 3/log 3 = 1), so our formula works for 1-dimensional objects."
"OK, for 2-dimensional objects, we have a similar kind of check, where we have for bisecting we have dimension equals log four divided by log two which you can check is two (D = log 4/log 2 = 2)."
You can check that on your calculator if you like.
"And for trisecting, N equals three (N=3), M equals nine (M=9), and"
"D equals log nine over log three, which is also equal to two (D = log 9/log 3 = 2)."
"Finally, for Dimension-3...well, I'll let you check that, but I promise you it works."
"Now all of this has been building up to what we really want to do, which is to calculate the dimension of the Koch Curve."
"So, if you remember, for the Koch Curve we draw a segment, then we erase its middle third, and then we draw an angle to replace that middle third by an angle whose sides are the same length as the other two sides."
"That is, 1/3 the length of the original segment."
"Then we iterate that, again and again, until we finally come up with something that looks something like this."
And we can keep going as long as we want.
"So for the Koch Curve, N here equals three (N=3) ."
"That is, remember we're reducing the size of the segments by a factor of three (3)."
"M, the number of copies of the original, is four (M=4)."
"At each level, we replace the original with four copies arrayed in this configuration."
"So according to our definition, our dimension D is equal to log of four divided by log three--that is log M divided by log N--which is approximately 1.26 (D = log 4/log 3 = log M/log N = 1.26)."
What exactly does this mean?
"Well, for one thing, it means that the dimension of this curve approximates 1.26."
It gets closer and closer to 1.26 as we iterate it through more levels.
But what does the 1.26 mean?
"So this is what we called earlier R1 and we called this earlier R2, it is the distance to that point very far away."
If I want to know what R2
- R1 is that's very easy now.
I draw a line from here perpendicular to this line and you see immediately that this distance here is R2 - R1.
"But that distance is also -- you realize that this angle is theta -- it's the same one as that one, so that distance here is also D sine theta."
"And so now I'm in business, I can predict in what directions we will see constructive interference."
"Because all we are demanding now, requesting, that R2 - R1 is N times lambda."
"And so we need that D sine theta and I'll give it a subindex N, as in Nancy, equals N times lambda."
In others words that the sine of theta N is simply N lambda divided by D.
"And that uniquely defines all those directions, the whole zoo of directions N equals 0, that is the center"
"line, N equals 1, N equals 2,"
"N equals 3, and so on."
And then I have the whole family of destructive interference.
Which would require that lambda
R2 - R1 which is D sine theta must now be 2N +1 times lambda/2.
Just as we had it on the blackboard there.
We discussed that earlier.
And so that requires then that the sine of theta N for the destructive interference is going to be 2N+1 times lambda / 2D.
So this indicates the directions where we expect maxima and where we expect minima as seen from the center between the two sources.
But now I would like to know what the linear distance is if I project this onto a screen which is very far away.
"And so let us have a screen at a distance capital L which has to be very far away, so here are now the two sources."
It's a different scale.
And here is a screen.
And the distance b- from the two sources to the screen is capital L. And here is one of those direction theta.
And you see immediately that if
"I call this the direction X, X being 0 here, that the tangent of theta is X/L."
"If but only if I deal with small angles, the tangent of theta is the same as the sine of theta."
"And therefore I can now tell you where the maxima will lie on that screen, away from the center line, which I call 0, that is now when X of N is L times the sine of theta, in small angle approximation."
"So this is approximately L times N lambda divided by D, and for the same reason you will get here c- destructive interference when X of N is going to be L times 2N+ 1 times lambda / 2D."
That is simple geometry.
So now we have all the ingredients here on the blackboard and I'm going to
leave it there for the rest of the lecture.
I'm just writing V1 here.
We do the reconfig with this member down.
"So now, these guys are on two."
"This one still has one, though, so when it comes back up, and it's trying to recover, it has an old version of the config."
"So it will communicate with the other servers, see that they have newer versions of the config, and grab that version from them."
"Then it will go into a recovery state, pulling data, rolling back, whatever it needs to do, and then eventually, it'll be back into that state and have the new configuration."
So that's fine.
"So in general, our config object is ID, set name, members, and each member of the set has a series of fields, ID."
"However, we can add some extra options to give the system some extra instructions."
"So what we can do is after this host name here, we can then have some options."
So let's talk about what these options can be.
"So, one of the most common options to use is arbiter, and it's actually called arbiterOnly."
"If you specify that, it indicates that the member of the set is what we call an arbiter, in MongoDB terminology."
It means the number has no data whatsoever.
"If we have a set, we might have a primary, a secondary, and an arbiter."
"So there will be replication here, these servers have data and no data."
"However, the arbiter does get to participate in elections, because the challenge without the arbiter in a situation"
"like this, with only two members, is how do you tiebreak on elections if they both want to vote for themselves?"
But consider a case like the following.
"You have a member here, a member here, and these are members of a set, and they're going to talk to each other, and they're trying to do an election."
They're trying to get a consensus on who should be primary.
"They both just booted up, let's say."
The problem is if the network is down.
"So this is our server one, server two, and then we have clients out here, client."
"And imagine we have a network here, and maybe we have some switches."
It's all in one data center in this example.
"Now we have a problem, though, which is this link is broken."
"Well if this server is up-- the mongod process is running on here, yet it's unable to connect to the rest of the world."
"This server is up, its mongod process is running."
It's able to connect to the rest of the world.
"So the question is then, who should be primary?"
"And it seems kind of clear that this one should, obviously and intuitively."
What about the people who eat it in their fish?
What are the public health costs?

Ireland?

"They just banned it outright, and it's possible in a place like Bali: it's an island."
You could just ban the bag.
And people would just have to learn to deal with it.
You learn.

"We have to be adults about the environment we live in. / Students are the next leaders to come in the very near future, so they need to be able to have access to the kind of information and education to be made aware."
"And often times, not just in Indonesia, but in many countries, the school curriculum is outdated."
"It's not relevant to the current issues that we're facing in modern times, so to be able to infuse the perhaps outdated or ""has-room-to-grow"" curriculum, we feel that would be really effective, and get the kids excited."
"We started to select schools in different areas, many of them were in a little bit more remote areas, where they didn't really have any collection service, so typically the school would be burning the waste, or throwing it in the river at the back."
"We had very good discussions in a high school, in which, without wanting to say what was the solution, we were asking,"
"""What do you think should be done, what can you do to reduce waste in your daily situation?"""
"And without having to say anything, because we had refreshments around that were served by the school, students went straight away,"
"""This can take away, this we can reintroduce the banana leaf, don't use that and that."""
"So, I think actually the high schools should be a pretty good target. / A lot of programs, they don't need a lot of money, but they need some."
"And if you could help in the fundraising efforts for getting these programs off the ground or sustaining them, it would be a huge, huge help."
"When you think about it on that global scale, what will future communities do?"

It's gorgeous.
"Like, if you take every culinary equipment and throw it all together and cover it in gold and then dip it in chocolate and then put it on a pedestal, that's the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen."
You have arrived.
"This kitchen is your culinary theater of dreams. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Because, for one of you,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; this is where you're gonna lose the label of a home cook &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and be given&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a brand-new title.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One of you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;will be crowned&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

"On the count of three, you'll lift those boxes."
"The mystery box challenge, it's exactly like when I open up the fridge, and there's a couple of this, a couple of that, which happens to me every single night. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One, two,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; three. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Lift.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Wow.
"I'm trying to figure out,"
"like, what is that?"
I have no idea what to do with it.
I see this beautiful duck breast.
"My heart lifts, because I know how it tastes."
I've worked with it before.
"You've all got &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the most amazing duck breasts,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;kale,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;rhubarb,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;dark rum,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sweet potato,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;five spice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;fresh bananas,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and some maple syrup. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Prove to us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that you truly belong here&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in this kitchen."
"People, when they lift that mystery box, they can see exactly what's underneath there."
"I have to listen to what the judges say when they list the ingredients, and try to commit that to my memory."

Instructional Design Consultant.
"You should have one assigned to you when you begin teaching, if you haven't been teaching already, and they are aware of course objectives, I don't really know course objectives when you come in, I only know that you need a video done."
"So, it's important to involve the Instructional Designer in that aspect."
They also know the best teaching methods that can be used.
It's important to have this three-way meeting between these people before we move on and actually start creating the video.
"Next, you need to know your format."
There are a few formats that we can use.
"There is: interview, teleprompt, teleprompted PowerPoint, and extemporaneous."
"The interview format is the most natural because it's conversational, it doesn't really require that much preparation because it's whatever happens, you need to have the person next to you to prepare."
"You should be familiar with questions and follow up questions, which means you need to pay close attention to what your guest is speaking about in order to follow up correctly."
Next is the teleprompter.
A teleprompter is...
I'm actually using one right now...
It is a script from a word processing document.
"It's very rigid due to it's word for word nature, and I would suggest not using it."
"Now, I'm not actually using a scripted teleprompter,"
I'm using a PowerPoint teleprompter controlled by an iTouch device.
"I call this teleprompted PowerPoint, or just PowerPoint."
"It's a good alternative to teleprompting because it is not word for word, you don't lose your spot, and it's like using note-cards, but you're not looking down."
"When you look down, away from the screen, it looks awkward and people can tell."
"You can control, again, with an iTouch, and it can't be seen by the camera."
"So, what would you do if you're going to use this format?"
You would e-mail me the PowerPoint.
I'll provide my e-mail at the end of this presentation.
"Do watch out for small text, no less than 24 pt."
"The best way, finally, to approach a format, is to use extemporaneous style."
"That is, without (maybe without) notes, but don't read word for word... it feels very rigid."
"That leads me to my last point, know your presentation."
"All of these techniques, excluding maybe the interview, require a good amount of practice before coming in to film."
"Mistakes can be edited out, but it looks more professional with the less cuts I have to make."
It's just part of life.
"It's just your reality at this moment, don't take it personally, as an affront to your arrogant idea of who you think you are."
"When you accept it, you start to undermine it."
"It's a wonderful thing to know that when you're at peace with fear, fear dissipates."
"When you're not angry at anger, the anger just loses its power source, it just dissipates."
"When you're just at peace or accept the grief, the grief doesn't last very long."
It's when we try and control these things and get rid of them that we're actually feeding them.
So we let go of this controller.
"We're kind to our emotions, even our negative emotions."
"So when you have, you know a negative emotion, you're disappointed, you're fed up, look at those emotions like beings in this world, be compassionate to the beings which exist in your mental landscape."
"And we should never be cruel, we should be gentle to ourselves and allow these things to be.."
"Because too often we do violence to our emotional world, and because we do violence to our emotional world, it's against the gentleness of this second factor of the eightfold path."
"Because we do violence to that world - ""I shouldn't be afraid!"
I shouldn't be grieving!
"I shouldn't be angry!"" you can see that that makes more negative emotions for your future."
Basically we call this the Law of Kamma.
The emotions you have now have been generated by what you've done in the past.
But they're there - you can't undo the past.
"You're stuck with this, the results of your past kamma."
"I don't mean past life - I mean what you've been doing today, it's created this moment you're feeling now."
But now what are we going to do about this.
"It's the kamma we do in the moment which is most important and if we face this moment, maybe a moment of grief, it may be a moment of fear, it may be a moment of sadness, a moment of anger, we can face this moment and say ""This is a result of past kamma, what am I doing about this now?"
I'm going to make good kamma with this feeling.
I'm going to let go of trying to control it.
I'm going to be kind to it.
I'm going to be gentle with it.
I'm going to respect it.
Allowing it like every other being in this universe to be - they have a reason to be here.
"I'm going to allow them to be and accept them and be at peace with them."""
"When you can make peace and be kind to the emotions you're experiencing in the moment, a wonderful thing happens - the emotional pain loses its sting, and the tightness of that emotional knot starts to unravel."
"Whether it's a broken heart, or whether it's grief over the loss of a child, when you really let it be, we call it healing."
We call it sort-of fixing up the problem.
You're talking about yourself and you're doing this in front of two evaluators that you don't know and that it's also going to be recorded and looked at by other people down the road.
So there is a whole bunch of evaluation here.
The evaluators are members of our research team.
So they're going to be watching you and scoring you while you're speaking.
"And the whole time that they're there, they're giving people this negative non-verbal feedback."
"And so they're sitting there very stoically, having no emotions, no facial expressions, frowning, furrowing your brow, they're not nodding, they're not smiling."
"So you can imagine, public speaking isn't so great to start with, then we're getting this negative non-verbal feedback."
What is wrong with me?
What am I doing that's so wrong and their response kind of amps up.
So we see a really strong threat response from this task usually.
Operators are here monitoring physiological signals as they come in real time.
And we now have another task for you to try to evaluate your ability to think on your feet.
"For this task, what we would like for you to do is count backwards, aloud, starting from number 996 in steps of 7."
This is something that participants don't know about until it's kind of thrust on them right then in the moment.
957?
I'm not sure that was right.
"And when you get one wrong, they tell you, ""I'm sorry that was incorrect."
"Please go back to the beginning""."
I'm not sure that was right.
"Please start back at the beginning, 996."
The take home from this whole line of research we've been trying to tell people is that stress isn't bad.
"The responses in our body, the stress responses can actually positively predict cognitive performance."
So people have the higher stresses or the higher amounts of arousal actually do better on their tests than people who don't.
"So when you do need that arousal, when you do need to make some instrumental response, the body's stress response is actually going to help you make those responses better or help you do something better."

That's similar to the bilexical dependencies of our earlier lexicalized
PCFGs.
But we don't want to use that as our only source of information partly because lexical information is so sparse.
And there are several other good sources of information.
So let's just go through those.
"So one is the distance between the head and the dependent, And if you look at this picture, what you'll see is that most dependencies are short."
They're with nearby words.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"So, this dependency here is a pretty long one."
But most of them are pretty short.
"Other sources of information are, what is the intervening material?"
"So, in general, dependencies don't cross over verbs, and commonly they don't cross over punctuation."
"Some exceptions, commas are quite often crossed over."
"So, looking at the words in between can give information about whether a dependency is likely or not."
A final source of information is looking at the valency of heads.
"And that's saying, for a particular word, what kind of dependents does it typically take?"
"So a word like the typically takes no dependents on the left and no dependents on the right, as in this case here."
"On the other hand, if you have a word that is, say, a noun, it will take dependents like adjectives and articles on the left."
"But it won't take those kind of dependents on the right, though can take other kinds of words as dependents on the right."
"For example, take prepositional phrase modifiers or relative clauses as dependents on the right."
So you can develop a quite rich typology of what kind of dependents words take.
Okay that should give you a better sense of what dependency representations look like and it's the big picture of how we go about parsing with them.
In the next segment we'll introduce a concrete algorithm for dependency parsing.

Sukiyaki
"Sukiyaki is a very popular one-pot meal in Japan. The main ingredient (or stuff) is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word ""yaki"" means ""sautee"" or ""grill"" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet."
History.
"In Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This custom was publicly decided by the then emperor on April 1, 675. But it is said that the real intention of this custom was to raise cultivation of rice product. This is a commandment (or rule) of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly."
"The first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment."
Preparation.
"Each Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between ""Kansai"" (western Japan) and ""Kanto"" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on ""Gyunabe"" that was in fashion in ""Meiji"" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, ""sake"" and ""mirin"") together. They then stew beef in it."
"In the ""Kansai"" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the"" Kansai"" style of cooking sukiyaki."
"The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear."
Poplar DLR station
"Poplar DLR station serves Poplar, London. It is a station on the Docklands Light Railway in Travelcard Zone 2. It is a served by four of the five routes of the DLR. Thus it is the busiest station on the network in terms of services."
Shawm
"The shawm was a musical instrument of the woodwind family that was played in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The modern oboe was developed from the shawm. Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double reed. It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a trumpet). It sounded very loud, and was mostly used outdoors."
"In German the shawm is called ""Schalmei"" or ""Pommer"". The first word may have come from the Latin word ""calamus"" meaning ""reed or stalk"". There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names. There were also several different sizes."
Westferry DLR station
"Westferry DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), in the Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. To the west is Limehouse station, whilst to the east the DLR splits, with one branch going to Poplar station and the other to West India Quay station"
"The DLR station was built midway between the site of the old Limehouse and West India Docks stations on the disused London and Blackwall Railway. Limehouse Police Station is nearby, as is St Anne's Church, built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and boasting London's tallest church clock tower."
Limehouse station
"Limehouse station is a railway station in Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is served by Docklands Light Railway (DLR) services and by National Rail services. The National Rail services are operated by c2c out of Fenchurch Street station. On the c2c route, Limehouse is between Fenchurch Street and West Ham stations. On the Docklands Light Railway, Limehouse is between Shadwell and Westferry stations."
History.
"The station was opened on 3 August 1840 as part of the London and Blackwall Railway. The area used to be known as Ratcliffe, whilst the station has been previously known as Stepney, Stepney Junction and later Stepney East station. Another station some distance to the east on the London and Blackwall Railway, open between 1840 and 1926, had previously been called Limehouse."
Limehouse station today.
"The current Limehouse station is to the west of Limehouse Basin, a marina and residential complex, and the Regent's Canal. Nearby is the north end of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, and the western end of the Limehouse Link tunnel. The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation."
"According to train operators c2c, ""Limehouse is a bustling commuter station in the rush hour with passengers changing onto the Docklands Light Railway. At quieter times of day, it's an ideal stop-off point for Limehouse Basin and Thames-side walks through London's Docklands""."

Evil
Evil means something which is morally bad or wicked. It is the opposite of good. People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the Ten Commandments is evil. A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil.
Logical problem of evil.
"A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows:"
Another argument goes:
"Arguments such as these are about the ""logical"" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct."
Theology.
"A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as ""God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will"" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are ""logically incompatible"", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose."
"In theology, there is a question: ""If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?"" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose ""not"" to do evil."
"Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition ""God exists"", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified."

"The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good. Christians believe that at the Second Coming of Christ, God will put an end to evil and the works of the Devil- see the end of the Book of Revelation. In movies or TV series evil people are often called villains. Political actions are sometimes viewed as evil such as authoritarianism, ableism or censorship. People disagree on why people do evil things. Religious people may think that it is the result of listening to an evil being such as the devil or sin. Others think it happens because of mental issues like anger, mental illness or revenge. Certain types of behavior are also sometimes seen as evil such as killing or lying to be punished. Sex crimes such as rape, hebophilia or pedophilia are also often seen as evil."

It first organized a tournament in 1958, with representatives from seven countries. Today, it has grown to encompass over 50 member nations around the world.[1] The IBCA hosts two important competitions: the Blind Chess Olympiad and the Blind World Chess Championship."
Rule modifications.
"Although most of the rules in blind chess are consistent with basic chess, there are a few modifications to the equipment to help blind and visually impaired players:"
"After making every move, each player is required to announce their move aloud to their opponent. Instead of writing the moves on a chess score sheet, the visually impaired player writes the moves in Braille or records the moves on a tape recorder."

"They include the jerboas, jumping mice, and birch mice. Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of ""saltation"", which is jumping from a bipedal stance. This feature is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas. Their movement resembles that of kangaroos more than that of true mice."
"Most species are nocturnal, and the eyes and ears are noticeably larger than usual in proportion to the body."
Personal defense weapon
"A personal defense weapon (PDW) is usually defined as a light, compact and easy to use firearm. However the definition varies depending on context and who you ask. Many will still say it is a short-barreled rifle (SBR). These are regulated in the United States by the ATF. Many SBRs have ""selective fire"" (you can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic fire)."
"The United States Department of Homeland Security defines a personal defense weapon as an M4 carbine (or a Colt AR-15 civilian semi-automatic rifle). Some governments' definition of PDWs includes handguns. An example is the Czech Republic. It has proposed a constitutional amendment which would allow its citizens to own and keep PDWs as a way to discourage terrorists. Regardless, a PDW is usually agreed upon as being somewhere between a submachine gun and an assault rifle."
History.
"In the 1980s, the term was used for troops in tight, confined environments. They needed a compact automatic weapon that could defeat body armor. It was designed for troops in tanks, military trucks and those operating from aircraft including pilots. The majority of soldiers do not take part in an infantry battle. Their jobs are usually to support the infantry. Their main role is not winning a fight, but often to escape an ambush. In other situations they may assist the infantry. PDWs are also used by bodyguards as they can be hidden under a jacket but still allowed good firepower. PDWs tend to be shorter range weapons."
"The term evolved as concealed carry became more popular, especially in places like the United States. Certain states in the United States make carrying a firearm for personal defense relatively easy while others make it more difficult. Also, quite a few other countries allow concealed carry, to various degrees. Pistols, especially compact models, are very popular self defense weapons today. Also, there are now a number of pistols available in rifle calibers."
Alternative self-defense weapons.
"In places where a firearm cannot be carried or the person chooses not to carry a firearm, there are other weapons they can carry. Common items such as a credit card, car keys, a pen or even a scarf can be effective self defense weapons. Because of the popularity of self defense, there are also specially designed non-lethal weapons designed not to look like weapons."

John Legend
Types of retaining wall are:
Main type of walls.
"Load Bearing Wall is a structural element. It carries the weight of a house from the roof and upper floors, all the way to the foundation. It supports structural members like beams, slab and walls on above floors."
Non-Load Bearing Wall doesn't help the structure to stand up and holds up only itself. It doesn't support floor roof loads above. It is a framed structure. Most are interior walls whose purpose is to divide the structure into rooms.
"Partition Wall separates spaces from buildings. It can be solid, constructed from brick or stone. It is a framed construction. The partition wall is secured to the floor, ceiling, and walls. It is enough strong to carry its own load. It resists impact. It is stable and strong to support wall fixtures. The partition wall works as a sound barrier and it is fire resistant."
"Cavity Wall A cavity wall or hollow wall consists of two separate walls, called leaves or skins, with a cavity or gap in-between. The two leaves of the cavity wall may be of equal thickness if it a non-load-bearing wall or the internal leaf may be thicker than the external leaf, to meet the structural requirements."
Veneered Wall holds up the material. It can be made of brick or stone. The most famous veneered wall is made of brick. The wall is only one wythe thick. It became the norm when building codes began to require insulation in interior walls. It is light weighted. Veneered walls can be built quickly.
Coordinated Universal Time
"Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the standard time system of the world. It is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude."
"The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people."
"Some websites, for example Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the Internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world)."
"Time zones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC−5 (United States east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in New York (UTC−5) and 10:00 in Moscow (UTC+3)."
07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).
"Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock. That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'. For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600. UTC also does not use daylight savings time - that way the time stays consistent the entire year."
"When this page loaded, it was , , in UTC."
Television
"A television set (also known as a television receiver or televisor or simply a television, TV set, TV receiver or TV) is a machine with a screen or set of lenses. Televisions receive broadcasting signals and change them into pictures and sound. The word ""television"" comes from the words tele (Greek for ""far away"") and vision (""sight"")."
Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
A TV can show pictures from many television networks. Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs.
"The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread."
"At first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor."
"All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1950s these were usually ""black and white"", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors. Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners. That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen."
"Today flat panel displays are the usual kind. These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges. This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape."
The early 21st century is also when digital television transmission became more common than analog television.
Sociology
"Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups. Sociology is a social science. People who study sociology are called sociologists. A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations."
"Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780 was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology. Auguste Comte, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena. Themes included: community, authority, status, alienation and lack of power."
"In the 2000s, some sociologists look at such things as: race, ethnicity, class, gender, the family and social interaction. They also study the breakdown of social structures; crime and divorce."
Work of sociologists.
Twyla Tharp
Twyla Tharp (born July 1 1941) is an American dancer and choreographer. She lives and works in New York City.
"Her work often uses classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. In 1973, Tharp choreographed the ballet ""Deuce Coupe"" to the music of The Beach Boys. It is considered to be the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed ""Push Comes to Shove"". That ballet featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet."
"Tharp has choreographed dances for many important ballet companies around the world. She also has had success on Broadway. In 1985, her staging of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances. Her dance musical ""Movin' Out"" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. The musical is set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel. It received 10 Tony Award nominations and Tharp was named Best Choreographer."
Honors and awards.
"Twyla Tharp received two Emmy Awards, 19 honorary doctorates, the Vietnam Veterans of America President’s Award, the 2004 National Medal of the Arts."
Tharp was inducted into the Academy of Achievement in 1993.
She was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for 2008.
Chytridiomycosis
"Chytridiomycosis is a disease that can kill amphibians, for example frogs. A fungus causes it. THe chytrid fungus ""Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"" causes the disease. The animals can catch it from each other. Chytridiomycosis one reason why there are fewer amphibians on Earth than there were. The fungus has decreased the amphibian population by 30% worldwide. Many spcies are now extict because they died of chitridiomycosis. In some species, only a few animals die, but in other species, they all die. This is called 100% mortality. There is no cure."
Temnospondyl
Temnospondyls are an order of small to giant batrachomorph tetrapods. They lived worldwide from the Carboniferous to the Triassic. A few species continued into the Lower Cretaceous.
"The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the Labyrinthodonts minus the Lepospondyls. It is probably an evolutionary grade, not monophyletic. It is convenient to use, because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia.p169 Many in the early Permian looked more like reptiles because they were adapted to life in a drier climate. Nevertheless, they were amphibians, and many larval stages have been found."
"They are a large group of some 40 families and 160 genera.p322 Fossils have been found on every continent. Their evolutionary history spans 210 million years. During this time, they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments."
"Fossils are known from the larval stage, metamorphosis, and maturity.p184 Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales, claws, and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have."
The youngest known temnospondyl is the Australian Koolasuchus that lived about 120 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous.
Lepospondyl
The Lepospondyli are a large group of batrachomorph tetrapods from the Palaeozoic era. They are sometimes included in the Labyrinthodonts.
"They lived during the Carboniferous to the early Permian. There are six different groups. The Acherontiscidae, Adelospondyli, Aïstopoda, Lysorophia, Microsauria and Nectridea. The included species which looked somewhat like newts, eels, snakes and lizards. Some of them were aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial animals. None of them were big animals."
Peltobatrachus
"Peltobatrachus (from Greek pelte, meaning shield and batrakhos, meaning frog) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibians from the late Permian period of Tanzania. They were large and slow-moving animals. They reached 70 centimeters (2.3 ft) in length. They were terrestrial amphibians. They only went back to the water to lay their eggs. They eat insects, worms and snails."
Terrestrial animal
"A terrestrial animal is an animal that lives on land such as dog, cat, an ant or an emu. It can also be used for some species of amphibians that only go back to the water to lay their eggs. It is usually a term to describe the difference between animals that live in water, (such as lobsters and fish), from animals that live on land."
Sister group
A sister group or sister taxon is a term used to describe the closest relatives of an organism (or other taxon) in a phylogenetic tree. It is a term in cladistics.
"The sister group of organism A is B. The sister group of the clade B+A, is C."
Suzerainty (American accent: soo-zer-en-tee) happens when a country X has its own government but cannot act independently because of a more powerful country Y. This more powerful country Y is called the suzerain and can usually control the foreign relations of X (how X interacts with other countries).
It differs from sovereignty in that the tributary still has limited control of its own stuff and internal country affairs.
A suzerain can also mean a feudal lord. Vassals must pay tribute to the feudal lord.
Some examples.
The term suzerainty originally described the relationship between the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding regions including:
"China historically had suzerainty over Mongolia, Korea."

Second-class citizen
"A second-class citizen is a person who is discriminated by their country, even though they are a citizen or legal resident."
"Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians."

"In perspective of the laws of the People's Republic of China, the Taiwan Independence movement is considered as ""secessionism"", too because the PRC considers the Taiwan area as its integral part as a rogue province."
Balawaristan National Front (Naji)
"The party was formed on December 28, 1989 under the Chairmanship of Nawaz Khan Naji. The first time reorganized in July 30 1993. In 1947 at the time of Independence of Pakistan the people of the area were predominantly Shia Muslims. However over the years the ethnic composition has been changed as sunni Kashmiri and other Pakistanis have settled in this area leading to discontent - although Shias remain the outright majority. A 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which included Gilgit-Baltistan, was 'Not Free'. In 2009 as part of ""Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order Act of 2009"", the region was granted self-rule for the first time with an elected legislature in its history, despite protests from the Republic of India it asserts that Gilgit-Baltistan is a part of the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu which they regard it as so-called an 'integral part' of India. which illegally regards the disputed region as Indian territory."

Political parties.
"Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism."
"The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last ""status voting"" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades."
Demographics.
"Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world."
The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is:

"About 6% of a watermelon is sugar, which makes it very sweet. There are many different types of watermelon. Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical.

Excise
"An excise or excise tax is an indirect tax charged on certain goods. As an indirect tax, they are charged by the producer or the merchant who then has to pay the government. For the same reason they are also not considered a sales tax. Excise taxes are commonly part of the retail price of a product such as gasoline, alcohol or cigarettes. Excise taxes may be charged by both state and federal governments."
Excise vs sales tax.
"Excise taxes are different from sales tax in two important ways. First, excise is charged only on specific goods. Sales tax can apply to most things a person might buy although certain jurisdictions may exempt food or clothing. Excise taxes are usually applied to luxury goods or products linked to health issues such as tanning salons or cigarettes. Secondly, sales tax is charged as a percentage of the purchase price. An excise tax is usually a fixed amount added to the price. It can be hard to tell how much excise tax a person pays because it is part of the purchase price. Sales tax is added to the price and is usually shown on the receipt."
US excise taxes.
"In the United States, excise taxes make up about 4 percent of all federal revenues. This is lower than many other countries. The Constitution refers to excise tax as an indirect tax. Some states in the United States have different names for excise taxes. For example, in the state of Massachusetts the excise tax charged on automobiles is called an ""ad valorem tax""."
Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on April 8, 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution"
changed the method by which United States Senators were elected. For the first 125 years of the Constitution required US Senators to be elected by the state legislatures. A number of problems in the United States Senate created the need to change how Senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the United States.
Background.
"When the Constitution was adopted in 1788, Senators were to be elected by the state legislatures. This remained in effect for 125 years. By the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure. In addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years, political machines had gained control over state legislatures. This corrupted the process and the Senate was seen as a ""millionaire's club"" who served private interests instead of the people. Beginning in the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed Senators be elected by direct election. The Senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals."
"At this point, many states changed their strategy. Article Five of the United States Constitution offers two methods for amending the Constitution. In addition to the common method of a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, was another method. It stated that if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one, Congress must call a constitutional convention. The method had not been used before. When it appeared two-thirds of the states wanted the change, Congress acted."
"George Herbert Walker Bush (June 12, 1924 – November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Before he became president, he was the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 (under the Ronald Reagan administration), an ambassador to the United Nations, a congressman, and Director of Central Intelligence. He was married to Barbara Bush from 1945 until her death in 2018. His children include the 43rd president of the United States George W. Bush, former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, and Dorothy Bush Koch. He was a Republican."
"Bush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Phillips Academy before serving in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. After the war, he graduated from Yale and moved to Texas, starting a successful oil company."
"He entered politics in the 1960s, first running for the US Senate in 1964, but lost the election. In 1966, he ran for the House of Representatives and won. Five years later, in 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to become the Ambassador of the United Nations, then chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973. In 1974, President Gerald Ford appointed him as Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China, then in 1976 Bush became the Director of Central Intelligence. In 1980, Bush ran for president, but lost the nomination to Ronald Reagan. However, Reagan chose Bush to be his vice presidential running mate."
"Eight years later, in 1988, Bush ran for president again, defeating Democrat Michael Dukakis. During his presidency, Bush led the United States through the end of the Cold War. He presided over the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War. He also signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which did not allow discrimination to disabled people. Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (also called NAFTA), which went into effect in 1994. He appointed David Souter and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Although he promised not to raise taxes, he did so in order to help make the budget deficit smaller (when the government spends more money than it makes.) He ran for reelection in 1992, but lost to Democrat Bill Clinton."
"After his presidency ended in 1993, Bush did activities that helped other people. He did this alongside Bill Clinton, his former rival. In 2000, his son, George W. Bush, was elected president of the United States. Another son, Jeb Bush, was elected governor of Florida in 1998. Jeb tried to run for president in 2016, but did not win the nomination."
"On November 25, 2017, Bush became, at the time, the longest-lived U.S. president. He passed the 93 years and 165 days lifespan of Gerald Ford, who died on December 26, 2006. On November 30, 2018, Bush died at his home in Houston, Texas at the age of 94. Bush is ranked as an above-average president."
Early life.
"Bush was born on June 12, 1924 in 173 Adam Street, Milton, Massachusetts. His father was politician Prescott Bush. He studied at Yale University. In June 1943, Bush became the youngest pilot in the United States Navy at the time."
"Bush served in the United States Navy from 1942 until 1945. During WWII, his plane was shot down. He won the Air Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. He married Barbara Pierce in 1945. They had six children."
Early career.
"Bush worked for Zapata Oil in Texas and was a politician in Texas, running for the Senate in 1964, but losing to Ralph Yarborough and later again in 1970, though losing again to Lloyd Bentsen."
"He was later a House Representative. He was also Republican Party Chairman and tried the vice presidency, with the support of such Congressional conservatives as Senator Barry Goldwater after Nixon resigned and Ford took office, but lost to liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller in 1974. In 1980, Bush also ran against Ronald Reagan for the Republican Party's candidacy for president but lost. He was then named Republican vice presidential candidate by Reagan after Reagan defeated him. Reagan and Bush were elected president and Vice President that year."
"During World War II, Bush was a crewman on a TBM Avenger. He had survived many crashes and sunk a Japanese ship. He later became a diplomat and head of the CIA."
"Presidency, 1989–93."
"After being Ronald Reagan's vice president, Bush was elected president in 1988 by defeating Michael Dukakis."
"Bush was sworn in as president on January 20, 1989, succeeding Reagan."
"While he was president, the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union fell apart. He was known for his failed promise speech """"."
"In 1990, Bush's off-hand comments about broccoli caused a minor political controversy. In 1992, he visited Kiichi Miyazawa when he vomited on his lap and soon fainted during a dinner feast. Hours later, Bush made a comment that he was suffering from the flu."
"When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in order to steal their supplies of oil, Bush led the United States and many other countries to protect Kuwait. The conflict was called the Gulf War. He also invaded Panama to remove Manuel Noreiga, who was guilty of drug trafficking."
"At his home, Bush also signed in important laws, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act. However, the country suffered from a recession. This was embarrassing, and many people believe this was the reason he lost the presidential election of 1992 to Bill Clinton."
"Bush left office on January 20, 1993 when Bill Clinton became president. Bush and his wife, Barbara, moved to Houston, Texas."
Personal life.
"Bush resided on a ranch in Houston, Texas with his family. After his presidency, he supported John McCain and his son George W. Bush. He supported Mitt Romney and Rick Perry for president. He attended the opening of the USS ""George H.W. Bush"", a naval ship named after him. He traveled with his son to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China."
"On February 15, 2011, Bush was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, by President Barack Obama."
"He was present at his son's presidential library opening ceremony on April 25, 2013. In July 2013, Bush had his head shaved in a show of support for the two-year-old son of a member of his security detail, who had leukemia. He is the most recent president that was a veteran during World War II."
Bush sent a letter to Donald Trump in January 2017 to inform him of his (Bush's) poor health that he would not be able to attend Trump's inauguration on January 20 and gave his best wishes.
"He was the father of George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, and Dorothy Bush Koch. He had two other sons; his other daughter Robin died of leukemia in 1953; his father (also a politician) was Prescott Bush. On April 13, 2013, he became a great-grandfather when his granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager gave birth to a daughter."
Bush was an Episcopalian.
Health.
"Bush suffered from a form of Parkinson's disease which forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair to get around, since at least 2012."
"On November 23, 2012, Bush had a bronchitis-like cough that initially brought him to Methodist Hospital in Houston for treatment. He was supposed to be released before Christmas, but was kept in and over the holiday because he got worse with a high fever. On December 23, 2012, he started to be in the intensive-care unit. On December 29, 2012, his health improved and moved out of intensive care. He was discharged in the hospital on January 14, 2013. On December 23, 2014, Bush was once again hospitalized at the Methodist Hospital after suffering a ""shortness of breath"". He was released from the hospital on December 30, 2014."
"On July 15, 2015, Bush fell at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine and broke a vertebra in his neck."
"On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are ""GO"", ""Free Parking"", ""JAIL"", and ""Go to Jail"". Along the sides of the board are properties (streets and businesses) for sale. The properties are: 22 ""streets"" (each marked with one of eight colors), 4 ""railroad stations"", the ""Electric Company"" and the ""Water Works"". There are also spaces called ""Income Tax"", ""Luxury Tax"", ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance""."
"In the original version, the properties and railroad stations were named after the streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London."
Setting up the Game.
"To prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are shuffled and placed face down on the board. Each player chooses a token (a playing piece), such as a thimble, a rocking horse, a boot, a dog, etc. (the tokens vary depending on the edition), and places it on ""GO"". One player is chosen to be the banker - this player is trusted with handing out money from the bank and collecting players' spent money during the game."
"The banker gives each player $1500 to start with. Each player rolls the dice, and the player who rolled the highest total takes the first turn."
Rules.
The object of the game is to own as much land (property) and to be the richest player.
"The rules can be found in every ""Monopoly"" box, but a summary is listed here."
Moving Around The Board.
"On your turn, you roll the dice and move your token forward (clockwise around the edge of the board) the same number of spaces as the sum of the dice you rolled. You must then follow the instructions of whatever space your token lands on."
"If you roll doubles (the same number on both dice), you get to take another turn after this one is over. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you don't get your third turn but you must go directly to Jail (see below)."
Jail.
"The Jail space has two sections, labeled IN JAIL and JUST VISITING. If you land on Jail by your normal roll of the dice, place your token on JUST VISITING and nothing bad (or good) happens to you. But there are three ways to be placed IN JAIL:"
"If you are put into Jail, take your token from wherever it is and place it directly on IN JAIL. This does not count as a move, so if this causes you to go past GO, you don't collect $200 from the Bank. If you are put in Jail, your turn ends immediately, even if you rolled doubles and would get to take another turn."
"While you are in Jail, you still roll the dice on your turn but you don't get to move your token. There are three ways to get out of Jail:"
Note that being in Jail doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game - it just stops your token from moving around the board.
Different editions.
"There are many editions of Monopoly. Officially-licensed editions are produced by Hasbro itself or by USAopoly, and unofficial editions are published by Toy Vault. Official versions are named ""____ Monopoly"" (such as ""Star Wars Monopoly"") and feature the Monopoly logo, and unofficial versions are named ""____-Opoly"" (such as ""Python-Opoly"") and do not feature the Monopoly logo."
"Milton Bradley has produced editions to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970s Monopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street properties."
"A number of video game adaptations have been made. In addition, many electronic editions exist that use credit cards instead of paper money."
"In India, a similar game is called Business."
"In Egypt, a similar game is called بنك الحظ (The Bank of Luck)."
"Acquire is another game with rules for more advanced business practices with stocks, but has similar basic concepts of Monopoly (owning properties of the same color, buying land and building on it, making the most money, etc.)."
Uses for Monopoly.
"People play Monopoly for different reasons. Some may play for family game night, others use it as a learning tool at school, and others play it just to have fun."
"Monopoly may be used as a teaching tool to teach children a variety of lessons while having fun. It teaches how to make deals when trading, playing fair (because cheaters never win), knowing the value of money, addition and subtraction, good sportsmanship, the thrill of competition, strategies and organization. At an elementary level, “it offers a marvelous vehicle for teaching mathematics”. Through the game, children explore different areas of mathematics: not only adding and subtracting but also probability, percentages, and patterns. At a higher level, teachers can use Monopoly to teach microeconomics principles."

IGN's main competitor is GameSpot, another gaming website."
"Argon is gotten industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year."
"40Ar is made by the decay of 40K with a half-life of 1.25 billion years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in knowing how old rocks are."
Uses.
"Argon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded. It can also be used in neon lights for a purple color. Argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds. Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing (ending) fires."
"Liquid argon is used in neutrino experiments and looking for dark matter. Argon is used to preserve food. Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans. Argon is also used as a preservative for such products as varnish, polyurethane, and paint. Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent and has been banned as use. It is used to know how old rocks are."
Trade
"To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an ""exchange"" or a ""swap""."
An early type of trade is barter. Barter was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of money. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade. Trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.
Terms.
The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods.
"Services can also be part of a trade. One person can do a job or work for another, and get something in return in a trade."
"Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling."
A place where trading takes place is called a market.
"When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called barter. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a purchase. In the past people would barter to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services."
Economics includes the study of trade.
"Trade occurs not just between people, but also between large companies and even countries. Governments sometimes take some of the money or goods involved trade between countries. This is a type of tax called a tariff. Smugglers try to trade without paying tariffs."
"Free trade between two countries is when there are small or no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on trade. When one country stops all trade with another country, it is called an embargo."
Types of trade.
Domestic trade.
Domestic trade is the exchange of goods within a country. Domestic trade is very important because it allows different types of goods to reach to all parts of the country. It makes the standard of living of the people of the country better. It helps an industry to grow by making sure that there are raw materials. Domestic trade may be divided into two. They are:
Wholesale.
"Wholesaling is the sale of goods to industrial, commercial, institutional or other professional businesses. They can also be sold to other wholesalers. It is the sale of goods to anyone that is not a consumer. Wholesalers usually buy and sort goods in large numbers."
Retail.
"Retail is the process of selling goods or services to consumers through many means of distribution to earn a profit. The term ""retailer"" usually means where a person sells a small amount of good to many individuals, who are consumers."
International trade.
"International trade is the exchange of goods and services between different countries. International trade has existed throughout history. Some examples include Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, scramble for Africa, Atlantic slave trade, and salt roads. When there is trade between two or more countries, factors like currency, government policies, economy, judicial system, laws, and markets affect trade."
International trade may be split up into three different types.
Import.
An import is a good or service that was bought in one country but was produced in another country.
Export.
An export is a good or service that was produced in one country but was sold to another country.
"Martin Luther King, Jr. was staying at the Gaston Motel when it was bombed on May 11th. Fortunately, he had departed earlier. In the residence of A.D. King, King's younger brother, another explosion exploded. In response to the explosions, the demonstrators became more violent. They rioted across the city, torching buildings and cars and assaulting police officers. To restore control, soldiers from the United States Army were dispatched."
The Youth Protest.
"Despite its best efforts, the campaign did not receive the national attention that its strategists had hoped for. They decided to include students in the demonstrations. On May 2, almost a thousand African-American kids skipped school to join the protests. Demonstrators quickly overflowed the cells in Birmingham. With the cells full. He used police dogs and fire hoses on the kids. Images of children being hosed down and dogs being mauled made national headlines. The protests had drawn the attention of the entire country."
Results.
"Despite the fact that there were still numerous issues with racism, the Birmingham campaign helped to break down several barriers to segregation. When the new school year began in September of 1963, the schools were likewise integrated. The campaign's most important effect was the nationalization of the issues and the engagement of leaders like President John F. Kennedy."
Louisville metropolitan area
"The Louisville Metropolitan Area is the area that spreads in Kentucky and Indiana and is more commonly known as by the public as ""Kentuckiana""."
Yakutian horse
"The Yakutian (Yakut: Саха ата, Sakha ata) or Yakut is a horse breed that is native to the Republic of Sakha (or Yakutia) in Siberia. It is similar to the Mongolian horse and Przewalski's horse, but is larger than them. It is special because of how it adapts to the very cold climate of Yakutia. It is able to find and graze on vegetation that is hidden under deep snow. It can survive without shelter in temperatures that reach −70 °C (−94 °F)."
Breed traits.
"The breed averages 140 centimetres (13.3 hands) in stallions and 136 cm (13.2 h) in mares. It has a sturdy stature, thick mane, and heavy hair coat. It shares these traits with other northern horse breeds, like the Shetland pony, Fjord horse, and Icelandic horse."

"Uozu, Toyama"
"is a city in Toyama Prefecture, Japan."
History.
Uozu developed as a castle town.
"In 1582, the forces of Oda Nobunaga forced the Uesugi clan to give up control of Uozu Castle."
"In 1918, riots started in Uozo because of increases in rice prices."
"In 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu."
Geography.
"Several rivers run through Uozu—the Fuse River, the Katakai River, the Kado River, and the Hayatsuki River."
Gold was discovered in the mountains of near Uozu.
Demography.
"According to Japanese census data,"
Lake Mungo remains
"The Lake Mungo remains are three sets of human fossils. They are Lake Mungo 1 (""LM1"", or ""Mungo Lady""), Lake Mungo 2 (""LM2""), and Lake Mungo 3 (""LM3"", or ""Mungo Man""). The sites are located near Lake Mungo, in New South Wales, Australia, in the World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes Region. Pieces of skeletons have been found in this region. These pieces have been attributed to over forty human skeletons. The Lake Mungo remains are the most significant of these."
Mungo Lady (LM1).
"LM1 are the fossilised, cremated remains of a young woman. They were found in 1969 by James Bowler with the University of Melbourne. Radiocarbon dating of pieces of bone from the burial put LM1 between 24,700 and 19,030 years old. Charcoal from a hearth 15 cm above the burial was dated at 26,250 years old (plus or minus 1,120 years). Reconstruction and study of the remains were mainly done by Alan Thorne at the Australian National University. The patterns of burn marks on the bones suggest that the body was first burned, then smashed, then burned a second time, before being buried."
"Research published by Bowler in 2003 rejected previous estimates for all of remains at the site. Optical dating concluded that both LM1 and LM3 were buried around 40,000 years ago (plus or minus 2,000 years). This makes it the earliest evidence of human cremation that has been found. It suggests that ancient indigenous Australians in this region had their own complicated burial rituals."
"The bones were returned in 1992 to the area's traditional owners: the Paakantji (Barkindji), the Mathi Mathi and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park visitor centre."
Mungo Man (LM3).
"LM3 was found by James Bowler on 26 February 1974, when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. It is located 500 m east of the LM1 site. The body was covered with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a complicated and artistic burial practice. Like the cremation of LM1, this indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought."
Description.
"The skeleton was of a slender individual, quite different to the build of modern indigenous Australians. The skeleton was badly preserved: large pieces of the skull were missing, and most of the bones in the limbs were damaged. Usually, the gender of a skeleton is determined using the bones in the skull and the pelvis. The problem is that these bones are in a very bad state in LM3, or they are missing altogether; in other words, the ""normal"" method of gender determination cannot be used with LM3. Since LM3 was discovered, other features were studied; most of these studies agree that LM3 was probably a male."
"LM3 was buried lying on his back, with his hands joined together covering the groin. Some of the bones show evidence of osteoarthritis and eburnation, and the teeth are well worn. Based on this, it is likely that LM3 was quite old (around 50 years old) when he died. New studies show that, using the length of his limb bones, it is possible to estimate LM3's height at 196 centimetres (77 inches or 6 ft 5 in), unusually tall for an Aboriginal."
Age.
"The first estimate of LM3's age was made in 1976 by the team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) who excavated LM3. They estimated that LM3 was between 28,000 and 32,000 years old. They did not test LM3's remains directly; instead, they made their estimate through stratigraphic comparison with LM1. In 1987, an electron spin resonance test was done on pieces of bone from LM3's skeleton. This gave an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999, optical dating work was done on quartz from the LM3 burial site. The results indicated a burial older than 24,600 years (± 2,400) and younger than 43,300 years (± 3,800)."
"Later in the same year, research led by Alan Thorne gave a new estimate of 62,000 years old (plus or minus 6,000 years). This estimate was made by combining data from uranium-thorium dating, electron spin resonance dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the remains and the soil in the grave. This estimate was very controversial, and some of the techniques used to get this estimate were criticised."
"In 2003, several Australian groups came to an agreement that LM3 is about 40,000 years old. A team led by Bowler did 25 more OSL tests that suggested that LM3 can not be older than 50,000 years. This age roughly agrees with stratigraphic evidence using four different dating methods. The age of 40,000 years is now the most widely accepted age for the LM3. This makes it the second oldest human fossil east of India, and the oldest in Australia. In addition to this, the study published in 2003 found that LM1 and LM3 are similar in age, and that humans were present at Lake Mungo as early as 50,000 to 46,000 years ago."
Other discoveries of remains.
"In 1998, the remains of a child were discovered. These are believed to have roughly the same age as Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. In 2005, erosion exposed another adult skeleton. Because it was not protected, this skeleton was destroyed by wind and rain about a year later."
Individual identity.
"A lifestyle is a way of living or doing things. Lifestyle is doing things, living your life and making decisions in your own unique way. Lifestyle can be political, social, economical and personal way of seeing, doing and understanding things. Not all parts of a lifestyle are our decisions. Surrounding social and technical systems, like economical situation and people around us, can limit the lifestyle choices available to the individual."

Seven Bridges of Königsberg
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically famous problem in mathematics. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735. This led to the beginning of graph theory. This then led to the development of topology.
"The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River. It included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges."
The problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges. Every bridge must have been crossed completely every time. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Euler proved that the problem has no solution.
Euler's analysis.
"First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter. The only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed. So, he changed the problem to abstract terms. This laid the foundations of graph theory. He removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In the language of graph theory, he replaced each land mass with an abstract ""vertex"" or node. Then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection, an ""edge"". An edge (road) recorded which two vertices (land masses) were connected. In this way, he formed a graph."
→
"The graph drawn is an abstract picture of the problem. So, the edges can be joined in any way. Only whether two points are connected or not are important. Changing the picture of the graph does not change the graph itself."
"Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In any walk of the graph, the number of times one enters a vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. If every bridge has been crossed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ""even"". This is because if there are n bridges, it is crossed exactly 2n times. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ""odd"" number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three are touched by 3). There are at most two masses which can be the endpoints of a walk. So the proposition of a walk crossing each bridge once leads to a contradiction."
"In modern language, Euler shows that whether a walk through a graph crossing each edge once is possible or not depends on the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler shows that a necessary condition for the walk is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This result stated by Euler was later proved by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an ""Eulerian path"" or ""Euler walk"". If there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph representing the historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path."
"Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735. It was published as ""Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis"" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ""Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae"" in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics."
Importance in the history of mathematics.
"In the history of mathematics, Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics."
Present state of the bridges.
"Two of the seven original bridges were destroyed during the bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Two others were later demolished. They were replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935). Thus, as of 2000, there were five bridges in Kaliningrad."
"In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but since it must begin on one island and end on the other, it is impractical for tourists."

Tagalog language
Tagalog is one of the main languages spoken in the Philippines and is the national language of the country. More than 22 million people speak it as their first language.
"It was originally spoken by the Tagalog people in the Philippines, who were mainly in Bulacan, Cavite, and some parts of Luzon. Now, Tagalog is spoken nationwide and used by Filipinos from different parts of the country to understand each other."
"It originally was used with an abugida, the Baybayin script, but the Latin alphabet is now used."
Basso continuo
"Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means ""continuous bass""."
"Basso continuo, sometimes just called ""continuo"", was played by an instrument providing chordal accompaniment such as a keyboard instrument or plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ, such as a small portative instrument."
It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player. The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and doubled on the other bass instrument. The composer would indicate what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.
Diwali
"Diwali (also: Deepawali) is one of India's biggest festivals. The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy. During this festival, people light up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay). They worship the Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom."
"This festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Kartikamasam which falls sometime during October or November. It is celebrated to mark the return of Lord Rama after 14 years of exile and his victory over the Demon Ravana. In many parts of India, Deepawali is celebrated for five consecutive days. Hindus regard it as a celebration of life and use the occasion to strengthen relationships. In some parts of India, it marks the beginning of a new year. People clean and decorate their house before the festival. They do colorful rangoli art works on floors."
"Deepawali is celebrated and is a public holiday in countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, Fiji, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago. It is also a school holiday in many states of the United States with a large Hindu population."
President George W. Bush had the first celebration of the holiday in the White House.
"Hindus light up their homes and shops to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi and to give them good luck for the year ahead. A few days before Ravtegh, which is the day before Deepavali, houses, buildings, shops and temples are thoroughly cleaned, whitewashed and decorated with pictures, toys and flowers. On the day of Deepawali, people put on their best clothes and exchange greetings, gifts and sweets with their friends and family."
"At night, buildings are illuminated with earthen lamps, candle-sticks and electric bulbs. Sweets and toy shop are decorated to attract the passers-by. The bazaars and streets are overcrowded. People buy sweets for their own families and also send them as presents to their friends and relatives. The Goddess Lakshmi is also worshiped in the form of earthen images, silver rupee. Hindus believe that on this day, Lakshmi only enters houses which are neat and tidy. People offer prayers for their own health, wealth and prosperity. They leave the light on in buildings believing that Lakshmi will not have difficulty in finding her way in."
Diwali is one of the most important festival of the Hindus.It is also known as deepawali or the festival of lights. It comes on Amavasya day in the month of kartik. Both rich and poor wear new clothes on this day. Lots of sweets are made. People light diyas and burn crackers. They ex- change greetings and sweets. Goddess Laxmi is worshipped on this day.

The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)
"The Sleeping Beauty is a ballet in a prologue and three acts. Marius Petipa and Ivan Vsevolozhsky wrote the story of the ballet. It was based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa designed the dances. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 January 1890. Carlotta Brianza danced the Princess and Pavel Gerdt the Prince, with Marie Petipa as the Lilac Fairy and Enrico Cecchetti as Carabosse. It was first presented in Europe in a shortened version by the Ballets Russes in London on 2 November 1921. Catherine Littlefield designed the first complete ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the United States, and presented the production on 12 February 1937 at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia Ballet."
Background.
"About ten years after Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" was presented for the first time, Tchaikovsky was asked to write a ballet for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The ballet would be based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky was very happy this story had been chosen. It was set in the age of Louis XIV. He would have the chance to write music in the Baroque style."
"Petipa gave Tchaikovsky very special directions about tempi, meter, and other musical matters. He even specified the length of particular pieces in exact numbers of bars. He asked for a Waltz in Act 1, a Mazurka in Act 2, and a Polonaise in Act 3. The ballet is tied together (and its drama and suspense heightened) through the repeated use of the two musical themes representing good and evil, personified by the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse respectively. Petipa's specifications stimulated Tchaikovsky's imagination, rather than hindered it as one might expect."
"Tchaikovsky's interest in setting the tale reaches back to 1867. It was then that he wrote a little ballet on the story for the children of his sister Alexandra Davydova. He had done the same for ""Swan Lake"". In November 1888, he had a conference with theater officials and Petipa. A draft of the scenario was drawn up. Petipa provided Tchaikovsky with a detailed analysis of the musical requirements. The composer set to work, and finished the score on 1 September 1889."
Story.
Prologue.
"A brief overture contrasts the themes of the malicious Carabosse and the benevolent Lilac Fairy. When the curtain rises, the court assembles for Princess Aurora's christening. Six fairies present their gifts. Carabosse, a fairy overlooked by the master of ceremonies, enters. She curses Aurora. The Princess shall die on her 16th birthday, she says, after pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. The remaining seventh fairy the Lilac Fairy comes forward. She cannot put the curse to rest, but she can soften it. The Princess shall not die, she commands, but sleep one hundred years. At the end of that term, a Prince will awaken her with true love's kiss."
Act 1.
"Sixteen years after the christening of Princess Aurora, the court assembles in the palace gardens to celebrate Aurora's birthday. Villagers dance a waltz. Aurora dances an adagio with four noble suitors. Carabosse enters unnoticed and slips Aurora a spindle. The Princess pricks her finger on the spindle. She falls to the ground, sound asleep. The Princess is carried into the palace by the noble suitors. The Lilac Fairy puts the entire court to sleep, then causes a dense forest of trees and thorns to surround the castle."
Act 2.
"""Scene 1."" ""The Prince's hunt. A woodland glade with a river in the background."" The stage is empty. Hunting horns are heard. Prince Desire, his tutor Galifron, and his friends enter. They have paused in the hunt to take refreshments. Several dances are performed by various ladies of the court. The hunt is resumed. The Prince is tired so chooses to remain alone in the forest. Here, he meets the Lilac Fairy who emerges from a boat of mother of pearl on the river. She has chosen him as the prince to awaken princess Aurora, and presents various visions of the princess to him. He quickly falls in love with her from the visions and begs the Lilac Fairy to lead him to her. The Lilac Fairy guides him through the forest until they reach the enchanted castle where Aurora rests."
"""Scene 2."" ""Sleeping Beauty's castle."" The Sleeping Beauty lies on a canopied bed. The King and Queen sleep in armchairs nearby. The courtiers and pages sleep standing up and leaning upon one another. Dust and cobwebs cover everything. The Lilac Fairy and the Prince enter. He tries to rouse the Princess and the court, but without success. The Lilac Fairy stands aside without interfering. The Prince kisses the Princess. She awakens. The dust and cobwebs disappear. The court awakens. The King grants the marriage of the Prince and Princess."
Act 3.
"""The Wedding of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora on the esplanade of King Florestan's palace."""
"The court assembles to celebrate the marriage of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora. The King and Queen make their entrances with the newlyweds. The festivities begin with a series of ""divertissements"". The Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Sapphire Fairies dance. Several fairy tale characters dance: Puss in Boots and the White Cat; the Bluebird and Princess Florine; Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf; Cinderella and Prince Fortuné; and finally Hop o' My Thumb with his brothers and the ogre. The Prince and Princess dance a ""pas de deux"". Roman, Persian, Indian, American, and Turkish characters dance a Sarabande. The act ends with a ""tableau vivant"" representing the Glory of the Fairies. This ""tableau"" was changed to represent the Glory of Apollo."
Human settlement
"In archaeology, geography, and history, a human settlement is a place where people live, either permanently (all the time) or temporarily (only some of the time). When people go to an area to live there, it is called settling an area. When they come from far away it is sometimes called a colony. The term may include hamlets, suburbs, towns and cities. Nomadic people do not settle."
Microtia
"Microtia meaning 'small ear' is a deformation of the outer ear. Over 90% of the time, only one ear is affected, but both ears can be affected. More boys are affected than girls. The right ear is more affected than the left. One in 1000 people have microtia. It can affect hearing. There are four grades of microtia:"
"Grade III is most common, and can be corrected by surgery."
"USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled commercial flight that was involved in an accident at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on February 1, 1991, colliding with SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569. Both planes caught fire after the impact and 35 of their occupants died, and another 29 were injured, thirteen of them seriously."
Investigation.
"The conclusions of the accident investigation carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established several causes for the accident."
"The fact that the ground radar was out of service on the day of the incident was one such root cause, as it would otherwise have been able to detect the presence of the SkyWest aircraft on the runway in time to alert the incoming US Airways flight. Other decisive factors were the lack of synchronicity between the flight progress tabs available to the controllers and the actual position of the aircraft on the airport runways and taxiways, which made the flight aircraft 5569 received incorrect instructions due to its controller's incorrect perception of its location. The poor night lighting of the runways and the glare problems that this lighting caused in the operators of the airport control tower, reducing their ability to see small aircraft during their maneuvers on the taxiways, was another of the determining factors of the Sinister."
"The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the airport administration for not having enough staff to handle landings and takeoffs, especially during night operations."
Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas

Western Sahara
"Western Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الغربية; Amazigh: Tanẓṛuft Tutrimt; ) is a territory in Africa. To the north is Morocco, to the east is Algeria, to the south is Mauritania, and to the west is the Atlantic Ocean. Its surface is . It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. Most of the territory is made of desert flatlands. The largest city is Laâyoune. More than half the population live there. The territory has a population estimated at just more than 500,000."
"Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since the 1960s when it was a Spanish colony. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, with its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government, both claim control over the territory."
"Since 1975, most of the territory has been part of Morocco. In 1973, some Sahrawis claimed the Moroccans and Mauritanians were occupying their land and started a movement. The movement turned violent, and the United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991. Many Polisario members and their families became refugees in camps in Algeria. The rest of Western Sahara is controlled by the Polisario/SADR, backed by Algeria. Many important countries have pressed both parties to agree to a peaceful solution. Both Morocco and Polisario have tried to get recognition from other countries. Polisario has won formal recognition for SADR from 81 states, and was extended membership in the African Union, while Morocco has won recognition for its position from the Arab League. In both instances, recognitions have over the past two decades been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends."
"Some countries (such as the United States) recognizes Morocco's sovereignty on Western Sahara, others claim that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are the legitimate government in Western Sahara. Most nations remain neutral on the subject. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the Polisario Front an armed militia fighting under Sahrawi nationalism."

Death of Gloria Ramirez
"Gloria Ramirez (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994) was an American woman dubbed ""the Toxic Lady"" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She was from Riverside, California."
"Ramirez had been admitted to the ER while suffering from late-stage cervical cancer. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms."
"Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in intensive care unit for two weeks."
"Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. This incident was initially thought to be a case of mass hysteria."
"The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart. Many people saw an oily substance covering Ramirez's body. Others noted a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth."
"An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that Ramirez had been self-injecting dimethyl sulfoxide as a treatment for pain, which converted into dimethyl sulfate, an extremely poisonous agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although the medical sector of Riverside supports this claim, scientists still believe it is not the case."
"Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park in Riverside."

Table tennis
"Table tennis, also known as Ping Pong (a trademarked name), is one of the most popular sports in the world, with players in many countries. It is played by two or four people on a table. To play this game, people use bats and small celluloid balls. You need also a net and a table. Table tennis was invented in England in 1880."
"The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), the worldwide organization, was founded in 1926, exactly 46 years after invention. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, 108 years after invention."
Many of the best players in the world today come from China.
History.
"The sport comes from England during the Victorian era, where it was played by the upper-class as a game to be played after meals. It has been suggested that simpler versions of the game should be developed by British military officers living in India during the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball."
"The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before the British manufacturer J. Jaques &amp; Son Ltd coined the term in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive equipment, Jaques provided, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920's making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, name."
"The next most important innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British addict of the sport, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis became more popular by 1901, to the extent that tournaments were being organised, books being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902."
"In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis Association. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed."
"In the 1930's, Edgar Snow commented in ""Red Star Over China"" that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects."
"In the 1950's, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, introducing greater spin and speed. These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue beginning in the mid-1980's increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988."

Phylum
"A phylum (plural: phyla) is the third highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. The second rank is kingdom and the highest is domain. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of animals, about 14 of plants, and about 8 phyla of fungus, but definitions vary."
"With genome analysis, groups of phyla have been put together based on evolutionary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard classification."
"Botanists usually prefer the word ""division"" instead of ""phylum""."
"There are about 8.4 million people in Switzerland. About 64% of the people speak Swiss German (German Alemannic) as their first language, in northern and central Switzerland. 19% of the people speak French as their first language, mainly in the west of Switzerland. 8% of the people speak Italian, in the south of Switzerland. Only 1% of the people speak Romansh, in the southeastern part of Switzerland. Romansh is an old language that is similar to Latin."
"The German-speaking people of Switzerland do not actually speak ""German"" as their native language. Swiss people speak something called Alemannic which has its own writing language and grammar but still is normally considered a German dialect. Alemannic may be difficult for Germans to understand. Swiss people do write like the people from Germany and also speak standard German very well, especially in the larger cities."
About 23% of the people in Switzerland do not come from Switzerland. They come from other places to usually work in Switzerland.
"The religion of most people in Switzerland is Christianity. 43% of the population follow Catholicism. 35% of the population follow Protestantism. 2% follow Eastern Orthodoxy. The religion of 4% of the population is Islam. The rest follow other religions, or they have no religion."
"Switzerland is famous for its chocolate, cheese, banking system, watches and mountains."
History.
"In 1291, people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the ""Eternal Alliance"". Together, they could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Näfels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles."
"People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the ""Peace of Westphalia"". More areas came to be part of Switzerland."
"Switzerland was important to the slave trade that forced black Africans to be sold as slaves. Swiss companies made indiennes, which are a kind of cloth. These cloths were sent to Africa and exchanged for captured slaves. Some Swiss also joined French companies already making indiennes or owned plantations with slaves in French colonies."
"In 1798, France invaded Switzerland. The ruler of France was Napoleon. He changed many laws. In 1815 Switzerland again became independent from France. Other countries agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Switzerland was free and neutral."
"The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short civil war in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations. It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality."
Government.
"Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, ""Bundesrat"" in German, ""Conseil Fédéral"" in French, ""Consiglio Federale"" in Italian and ""Cussegl Federal"" in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women."
The seven people are:
"There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The ""Council of States"" and the ""National Council"". Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council."
"The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a ""referendum"". If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an ""initiative"". The constitution is the basic law of a country."
Economy.
"Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. They recently made two other contracts."
"The banks of Switzerland and the insurance companies in Switzerland together produce eleven per cent of the gross domestic product. Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists. Davos, St. Moritz, Pontresina and Flims are in Switzerland. These towns are important both in winter (for skiing) and in summer. Tourists also like the cities of Lucerne, Geneva, and Zürich."
"In 2011 the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland directly and indirectly employed about 135,000 people. The companies Novartis and Roche are the second and third largest pharma companies in the world. They both have invented many life saving drugs because of well developed research and development facilities."
Literature.
The literature of Switzerland is divided according to the language used. Most Swiss literature was written in German from 1291 until 1798. French became popular in Bern and elsewhere in the 18th century and many words also in the German speaking parts of Switzerland come from the French and are not known to Germans. Italian language and Romansch-Latin literature are less common in Switzerland.
"Heidi, a book for children by Johanna Spyri, is the most famous book of Switzerland. It is in the mountains in Graubünden."
Sports.
"Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland. Because of the large mountain range the nature of the country is well suited for such activities. Bobsleigh was invented in St. Moritz. The first world ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). St. Moritz hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and in 1948. Among the most successful skiers and world champions are Pirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche."
"Many Swiss are fans of football. The national team or 'Nati' is widely supported. Switzerland was the joint host, with Austria, of the Euro 2008 tournament. Many Swiss also follow ice hockey. In April 2009, Switzerland hosted the 2009 IIHF World Championship for the 10th time. The National League A is the most attended league in Europe."
"The many lakes in the country make Switzerland a good place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi. They were the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003. They also won in 2007. Tennis has become more popular. Swiss players such as Martina Hingis and Roger Federer have won multiple Grand Slams."
"Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland after the 1955 Le Mans disaster. There were exceptions for events such as Hillclimbing. This ban was overturned in June 2007. During this period, the country still had successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sebastian Buemi, Jo Siffert and successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category."
"Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or ""Schwingen"". It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is another native Swiss sport. It is like a cross between baseball and golf. Steinstossen is the Swiss version of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. It is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805."
LOL
"LOL, or lol, is an internet slang term that means ""laugh(ing) out loud"". It is commonly mistaken for ""lots of love."" LOL is often used in messages meaning ""That is really funny."""
Theories as to the origin of the name include:
"A map (""Leyland map"") dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name ""Casus Rupes"" (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above, but which may be a folk etymology."
History.
Wrecks.
"There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS ""Stella"", wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker ""Constantia S""."
"It was believed for centuries that HMS ""Victory"" was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss. However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nautical miles (110 km) from the Casquets."
Casquets lighthouses.
"The first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724, and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter, St Thomas and the Dungeon. Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France."
"They were built by Thomas Le Cocq, owner of the rocks, under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses. The lighthouses reverted to Trinity House in 1785."
They were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790; and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818. This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds.
"The lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823. The towers were raised by a further 10 yards (9.1 m) in 1854, and 184 kilocandela lamps were added which gave three slow flashes every half minute. In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off."
"British commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse, following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. The first raid, Operation Dryad, took place on 2/3 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war."
"In 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2,830 kilocandela lamp was put in. The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti-clockwise. At the same time, the other two towers were reduced in height."
"The current light in the 23 metres (75 ft) North West Tower is 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 3.7 seconds apart. It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles (44 km) in clear weather. The East Tower contains the foghorn, which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock. The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays. The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich."

Sulfur cycle
"The sulfur cycle is the way sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems."
"Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion."
Steps of the sulfur cycle.
Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.
Human Impact on the sulfur cycle.
"Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming."
Flag of Azad Kashmir
"The State flag of Azad Jammu and Kashmir traditionally displays the Pakistani national colours, white and dark Green, with a Crescent and star to represent the Muslim-majority all of which shows its Islamic heritage and strong ties with the Federation of Pakistan.

The four white stripes symbolizes the main rivers of the Kashmir region; Indus (National River of Pakistan), Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi. It also represents the five geographic divisions of the Disputed territory, namely, Baltistan, Gilgit, Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh."

Order of the Indian Empire
The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria in 1878. The Order includes members of three classes:
"No appointments have been made since 1947, the year of Indian independence and the Partition of India. In 2010 the last surviving knight, The Maharaja of Dhrangadhra, died and the order became dormant ."
"The motto of the Order is """", (Under the auspices of the Empress), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the Empire of India; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India."
History.
"The British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and ""native"" officials who served in India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but a second class, Knights Commander, was added in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"On 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became ""The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire"" and was divided into two classes: Knights Commander and Companions, with the following first Knights Commander:"
"However, on 5 January 1888, a further proclamation regarding the Order was made; the Order was expanded from two classes to three - Knight Grand Commander, Knight Commander and Companion. Seven Knights Grand Commander were created; they were:"
"Normally the highest grade in British orders is Knight Grand Cross, but Knight Grand Commander was chosen for the two Indian awards because of the Christian symbolism of the cross."
"Appointments to both Orders stopped after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished, and Queen Elizabeth II remains the Sovereign of the Orders to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order."
"The fictional characters Purun Dass (invented by Rudyard Kipling) and Harry Paget Flashman (invented by George MacDonald Fraser) each held a KCIE; Kipling's engineer Findlayson in ""The Day's Work"" (1908) wants the CIE."
Composition.
"The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order. The Grand Master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"" rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"" so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order."
"At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion. There could be any number of members. In 1887, the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander (50 at any given time) and Companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same."
"British officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed Knights Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, except the princely rulers, could not be members the Order. Female princely rulers were admitted as ""Knights"" rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies""."
"As well, other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed."

Area code 312
"Area code 312 is an area code that is part of Illinois. It was one of the first area codes created in 1947. It initially covered the entire northeastern portion of Illinois, but after it was split by 708 in 1989, 630, 847, and 773, all in 1996, it now covers only downtown Chicago, with 708 and 773 covering the rest of Chicago. It was overlaid by 872 in 2009."
Civil government in Portugal
"In Portugal, the civil governments (Portuguese: ""Governos Civis"", singular ""Governo Civil"") are the groups of public administration that represent the government at the district level. Each civil government is led by an administrative magistrate ""and"" the civil governor (""Governador Civil""). The administrative magistrate is a delegate of the central government. The civil governor is chosen by the Council of Ministers. The civil government operated under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Administration."
"The role of Civil Governments has become smaller since their creation in 1835. At first, they had many powers as representatives of the central government . They also made certiain that all State services within the district worked together. They now serve as a local delegations of the Ministry of Internal Administration. Their responsibilties inclue issuing passports, public safety, and elections."
"In 2011, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho ended all Civil Governments with Decree-Law No. 114/2011 of 30 November. That law gave all of the powers of the civil governments to other groups. These include the Municipal Chambers, the police, the National Republican Guard and the National Authority for Civil Protection). No civil governors have been appointed since this time but the post was created by the Constitution and still exists"

Minecraft PE
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is a mobile version of Minecraft for phones and tablets. In 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Android market as an early version. It was then released for other devices in October 2011. An iOS version was released on November 2011, and a port was made for Windows Phones after Microsoft bought Mojang. The port focuses on the basic building and the survival parts of the game, and does not have all the features of the PC version. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is in C++ and not Java code, because of iOS not being able to support Java code. However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices."
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on December 19, 2016."
List of Secretaries of State of the United States
This is a list of secretaries of state of the United States.
Secretaries of foreign affairs (1781–1789).
"On January 10, 1780, the Confederation Congress created the Department of Foreign Affairs."
"On August 10, 1781, Congress put Robert R. Livingston as the first Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Livingston was not able able to go into office until October 20, 1781. He was the Secretary of Foreign Affairs until June 4, 1783. He was succeeded by John Jay on December 21, 1784. He served who served until March 4, 1789. Jay stopped being the Secretary of foreign affairs, when the government went from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution."
John Jay was the Secretary of State until Thomas Jefferson came back from France.
Secretaries of state.
"On September 15, 1789, Washington made a law that changed the name of the office from Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Secretary of State and he changed the name of the department to the Department of State. He also added many powers and responsibilities to the secretary and the department. Thomas Jefferson was the first Secretary of State on March 22, 1790."
List of secretaries of state by time in office.
This is a list of United States secretaries of state by time in office. This is based on the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater. Cordell Hull is the only person to have served as Secretary of State for more than eight years. Daniel Webster and James G. Blaine are the only secretaries of state to have ever served non-consecutive terms. Warren Christopher served very briefly as Acting Secretary of State non-consecutively with his later tenure as full-fledged Secretary of State. Elihu B. Washburne served as Secretary of State for less than two weeks before becoming Ambassador to France.
Disease.
"For centuries, people around the world have used mass graves when many people died at once from epidemics of diseases. The goal of this type of mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately."
"For example, during outbreaks of the bubonic plague (""The Black Death"") in Europe, people were terrified of catching this disease from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave:"
"However, at some mass graves for plague victims, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions."
Disasters.
"More recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one."
"For example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no room, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one."
"One Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: ""You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial."" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. Like at the mass graves for the plague victims, they were still trying to honor the dead, even though they had to bury them in mass graves."
"Some areas in Japan also had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In Japan, most people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead."
Murder and genocide.
"Throughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for victims of disease or disasters, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered."
Mass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples.
World War I.
"During World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them."
World War II.
The Holocaust.
"During The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders:"
Soldiers' graves.
"During World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe."
"The Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad."
The Soviet Union.
"In the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves."
The biggest include:
The Korean War.
"Early on in the Korean War, South Korea killed at least 100,000 people who had been put in prison for their political beliefs. They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea."
The Vietnam War.
"During the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves."
Genocide in Cambodia.
"From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution."
Other wars.
"During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Bosnian Serb Army killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica genocide. They buried them in mass graves. In 2003, mass grave specialists found a mass grave that was ""as big as a tennis court."" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves."
"During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it."
"They hunt whales for their oil, made from their fat, called ""blubber"", and the meat. Today, there is a treaty which bans the hunt of some whale species. Most countries signed the treaty. A few countries still hunt whales for research purposes. Among those countries are Norway, Iceland and Japan."
Crayon
"Crayons are writing tools made with colored wax, water, and citric acid or chalk. Young children often use them to draw. Some adult artists use them too. They melt at a low temperature so they can be used in crayon-drip art. One very well-known brand of crayons is Crayola, a company by Binney and Smith."
Self-defence
"Self-defence means fighting off something or another person to protect yourself and maybe others. Ways of self-defence include martial arts or using a weapon. Sometimes, self-defense can cause serious harm to the other person. In most nations, you cannot be prosecuted for this harm. In the United States, an act of self-defence can only count as self-defence if the victim is in a situation that can cause them serious injury or death. In international law all persons have the right to self-defence."
Defence of others.
"The law of self-defence is the same when you protect others. Generally, you must have a good reason or belief that you needed to defend yourself in self-defence. However, in many places, if the court decides that the defence may have been too extreme, the person may face criminal and civil charges."
1913
"1913 (MCMXIII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar, and a common year starting on a Tuesday in the 13-day slower Julian calendar. It was the 913th year of the 2nd Millennium, 13th year of the 20th Century and the 4th year of the 1910s decade."
1469
1469 was a common year.
Dodgeball
"Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls, or hard rubber balls, at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball,he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside."
"Dodgeball is often played in elementary schools in physical education classes. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because players can get hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools."
"Dodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film """" (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, ""Extreme Dodgeball""."
Local area network
"A local area network (LAN) is a computer network in a small area like a home, office, or school. Many computers can be connected to share information and Internet connections. Most LANs use Ethernet to connect together."
Topology.
"LAN topologies tell you how ROM devices are organised. Five common LAN topologies exist: bus, ring, star, tree, and mesh. These topologies are logical architectures. This means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices, but that the actual cables that connect the devices might not be connected the same way. For example, logical bus and ring topologies are commonly organized physically as a star."
Pharaoh
"Pharaohs were kings of ancient Egypt. The word comes from the Coptic language word ""Per-aa"", which means ""Great House"". Pharaohs were believed to be descended from the gods."
"The Valley of the Nile had been lived in by early humans for at least 700,000 years. The area has a long history of human civilization, but Egypt as a state begins in about 5660 BC. At this time, the separate kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united."
"People studying Egyptian history have divided the pharaohs into 31 groupings, called dynasties. These dynasties were usually, but not always, based on a related family group. During the long period of the pharaoh's rule over Egypt, there were times when they did not control the whole country. This means that some dynasties only controlled part of the country, and another dynasty ruled another part at the same time. Also there are not complete records, so there are gaps in the lists of pharaohs, and it can be very difficult to list the rulers in chronological order. The origins of the first pharaohs survive only as legends."
"Before the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, kings wore crowns of different design, to show which part of Egypt they ruled. The red crown was worn in Lower Egypt. The white crown was worn in Upper Egypt. Later, kings of the whole of ancient Egypt wore a combination of the two crowns, called a Pschent."
"When a pharaoh died, their personal treasure was buried with them; not the treasure of the entire kingdom. The pharaohs were buried in large tombs, the largest and most famous were the Pyramids. Many later pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. Paintings and writings discovered in these tombs have provided much of our knowledge of the pharaohs. New discoveries, such as that in 2014 of a new dynasty ruled by a previously unknown pharaoh, Senebkay, are changing what we know about ancient Egypt. They were mostly men, but there were women such as Cleopatra and Nefertiti. Pharaohs were considered to be half-man and half-god."
"On 14 March 2014, Skrillex released his debut studio album ""Recess""."
Chess Records
"Chess Records was an American record label from Chicago, Illinois. It was founded by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. The label was important for blues, R&amp;B, soul, gospel music and early Rock and roll. The label soon was very successful because it recorded music the major labels did not. The label was originally at 2120 S. Michigan Avenue. The site is now home of Willie Dixons Blues Heaven Foundation."
"A critic said, that without Chess Record today's music would sound different. Another calls Chess Records ""America's greatest blues label""."
History.
"In 1947 Leonard Chess bought a label called Aristocrat Records. In 1950 Leonard brought in his brother Phil and they renamed tha label to Chess Records. The first release was ""My Foolish Heart"" b/w ""Bless You"" by Gene Ammon, which became a hit. In 1952 they started Checker Records for radio play because the stations only played a limited number of songs from one label and in December 1955 the started Argo Records for jazz music. The first LP was produced in 1958."
"In the beginning Leonard Chess was the producer, but later the business was handled by Ralph Bass for the gospel section and Willie Dixon for blues. Dixon wrote a lot of songs which became hits and also played bass on many recordings. The label was also famous for its session musicans who played on most of the company's Chicago soul recordings, such as drummer Maurice White and bassist Louis Satterfield, both later shaped the funk group Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire, guitarists Pete Cosey, Gerald Sims and Phil Upchurch, pianist Leonard Caston, later a producer with Motown and organist Sonny Thompson. 1953 they begun to work together with Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service. One of the musicians from Memphis was Howlin' Wolf, who did many hits for Chess."
"In 1969 the label was sold to General Recorded Tape (GRT) and 1972 the only part of the business which still existed was the recording studio, Ter-Mar Studios. In the mid-eighties the catalogue of Chess Records was sold to MCA Records. The 50th anniversary of Chess Records was celebrated by a number of Cds featuring great artist who had recorded for Chess. In the 2000s, Universal's limited-edition re-issue label, Hip-O Select began releasing a series of box-sets celebrating the work of Chess artists as Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry."
Cadillac Records.
"Chess Records was subject of the 2008 film ""Cadillac Records"" by Darnell Martin. Beside the portrait of Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) it brought to the cinema the characters of Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright), Little Walter (Columbus Short) and Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles)."
Physiotherapy
"Physiotherapy is also called ""physical therapy"". It attempts to treat what limits a person's abilities to move and do things in their daily life."
"It is the treatment of disease, injury, deformity or disability to improve the quality of life. Physiotherapists use exercise, hands-on techniques (including manual therapy, dry needling and trigger point therapy), patient education and various other methods."
"Physiotherapists are well known for their treatment of musculoskeletal injuries such as ankle sprains, muscle injuries and tendon pain. Musculoskeletal physiotherapists are often clinic-based, however are often also working with sporting teams and also work in hospitals."
"However, physiotherapists are also crucial for many conditions that you may not have realised. neurophysiotherapy plays an important role in the recovery of neurological conditions such as stroke patients and traumatic brain injury patients. Physios also play an important role in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, such as after heart surgery and in respiratory conditions such as emphysema."
"Physios also play a major role in treating children, including those with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Down syndrome, and other chromosome-related conditions."

Customs.
"In Portugal, Spain and Mexico, ""ofrendas"" (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play ""Don Juan Tenorio"" is traditionally performed. In Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, people bring flowers to the graves of dead relatives. In Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Croatia, Austria and Germany, the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives. In the Philippines, the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere. In English speaking countries the festival is traditionally celebrated with the hymn ""For All the Saints"" by William Walsham How. The most familiar tune for this hymn is ""Sine Nomine"" by Ralph Vaughan Williams."
The festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Church of England and in many Lutheran churches.

Origami
"Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes, but many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this."
"When the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called ""modular origami"" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami."
History.
"The beginnings of origami are not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looked exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom."
"There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, ""Kan no mado"" was written, and it was the first book of origami models."
"Recently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries."
Paper.
"Peter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says ""the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square."" Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned."

Laksam
Laksam is a small city in Cumilla district of Bangladesh. It is in the Chittagong Division. Laksam is the birthplace of Asia's first female Nawab (royal title of powerful rulers) and one of the earliest female education activist Faizunnsa Chowdhurani.
Nawab
Nawab (;
Punjabi : ਨਵਾਬ;
"Persian,"
"Punjabi ,"
"Sindhi,"
"Urdu: نواب), also spelt Nawaab, Navaab, Navab, Nowab, Nabob, Nawaabshah, Nawabshah or Nobab, is a royal title. It was used by sovereign ruler, often of a South Asian state. In in many ways it is similar to the western titles of King. The relationship of a Nawab to the Emperor of India has been compared to that of the Kings of Saxony to the German Emperor. In earlier times, the title was given by the Mughal emperor to Muslim rulers of subdivisions or princely states in the Indian subcontinent who were loyal to the Mughal Empire. The title is an equivalent to the title Maharaja."
"""Nawab"" usually refers to males. It means ""Viceroy"". The female equivalent is ""Begum"" or ""Nawab Begum"". The primary duty of a Nawab was the administration of a certain province."
"Similar to a British peerage, The title of ""nawabi"" was also given to persons and families who ruled a princely state of British India. In some cases, the titles were also given with jagir grants. These were either cash or land-holdings."

At first the three partners were developing weaponry and war simulators for the Israeli army. After one of the partners, Evgeni Khazanov, looling for his daughter’s tennis practice. He wondered why a sport with so much money did not have any advanced technology to help players improve their game."
"The technology was commercialized in 2013. Later it was adapted for many other sports including soccer, martial arts, volleyball, squash, handball, gymnastics, dancing, hockey and wrestling. PlaySight costs $20 million and now has offices in Kfar Saba, New Jersey and Los Angeles."
GoodBarber
"GoodBarber is a no-code development platform, developed in France, which allows users unfamiliar with programming to build mobile apps and progressive web applications, using Drag and Drop graphic user interface."
History.
Establishment.
"GoodBarber was born from the merger of two French software companies, DuoApps and WebzineMaker, It was founded in 2001, in Ajaccio (Corsica), by François-Sébastien Simoni and 3 associates (J. Pietri, P. Chiappe and F. Bernardini). At the beginnings, the GoodBarber's platform performed as generator of blogs in SaaS mode, websites and WebTVs. In 2011, DuoApps and WebzineMaker officially launched the native mobile application builder named GoodBarber in order to develop and market a technical solution to build native IOS and Android applications and Progressive Web apps, for content publishing and eCommerce shopping stores. Also used as content management system by some research organizations."
"GoodBarber's technology is recognized among No-code development platforms, best known as App builders or App makers."
After launch.
"As a cross-platform software, the technical platform generate mobile applications compatibles for mobile phones for both Android and iOS and Progressive web application (PWA) mobile applications, accessible from the web through by a mobile browser."
Life.
"He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He attended Copenhagen University and earned his master's degree in 1841. During this time, he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837. Although they were engaged for a time, Kierkegaard ended the engagement in 1841."
"After breaking up with Regine, he spent much of his time writing book after book, in a highly dramatic yet subtle way. He also wrote some of his works using pen names, or pseudonyms. He died in Copenhagen. Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime, after his death they became influential in the 20th century."
Works.
"Books by Kierkegaard. ""Either/Or"" and ""Fear and Trembling"", both published in 1843, are thought to be especially significant."
Despotism
"Despotism is a form of government that is controlled by one person or a small group of people. The person who controls the state is called a ""despot"". The despot has complete control of the state, like a dictator or tyrant. In history, the pharaohs of Egypt were despots. The word ""despot"" is thought to come from the Ancient Greek word ""despotes"", which means ""the master""."
"According to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is as follows. In the case of the monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by his or her own will and caprice."
The importance of the idea of despotism is that today it is a very common type of dictatorship or direct rule. Ruling monarchies are today few in number.
"Even when there are elections, as there are for the Russian presidency, opposition candidates are at such a disadvantage that they are rarely, if ever, successful."
"Despotism has always been associated with Eastern rather than Western states. Of the former Soviet Union, it is only the new states to the west which have attempted, with difficulties, to build genuine democracies (such as Moldova and Ukraine)."
Lakshadweep
"Lakshadweep (; ISO: , formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (), are a group of islands in the Arabian Sea. They belong to India. Their capital is Kavaratti. It covers an area of . Eleven of the 36 coral atoll islands of Lakshadweep are inhabited."
"The islands are the only coral atolls in India. The people living there are Malayalam and Mahl people, who have been influenced by Arab traders. Lakshadweep is a Muslim region just like the neighbouring Maldives, where tourism is strictly regulated. Lakshadweep has the largest percentage of Muslims - 98%, even larger percentage than Jammu and Kashmir and is the only Muslim-majority Indian administrative division entirely within India."
"Apart from the emerging tourism, government jobs, fishing and coconut production are the mainstays of the Lakshadweep economy."
Daman and Diu
"The territory used to belong to Portugal. In 1961, Indian soldiers and air fighters took control of the territory. In 2020, it merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli to make a new union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu."
Riding helmet
"A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of helmet made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground."
"Helmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders."
Ketchup
"Ketchup is a kind of thick, liquid sauce. It is made from tomatoes, so it is sometimes called tomato sauce. Usually it is used to add flavour to food. Some people like to eat sausages, burgers, hotdogs or fishsticks with ketchup. Ketchup tastes very unlike the real tomato."
History.
Tomato ketchup.
"Although today's ketchup is tomato based, it did not appear until about a century after other types. By 1801, a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison. It was later printed in an American cookbook, the ""Sugar House Book"". James Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in ""The Virginia Housewife"". This was an important 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin."
"As the century went on, ketchup became more popular in the United States. More Americans began to like tomatoes. Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. A man named Jonas Yerks (or Yerkes) is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly after that, other companies did the same. F. &amp; J. Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876. Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised: ""Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!"""
"The ""Webster's Dictionary"" of 1913 defined ""catchup"" as a ""table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Written also ketchup]."""
"Casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago (mya) in the Mississippian. It was a small animal, length about 15 centimeters."
It lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now Scotland. It had a mosaic of 'basal' (= primitive) amphibian and 'derived' (= advanced) amniote characters.
"""Casineria"" was at or very near the origin of the amniotes. It may have been one of the very first true amniotes. The only fossil lacks key elements: most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing. This makes exact analysis difficult."
"""Casineria"" was an insectivore. This earliest amniote had five fingers with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest known clawed foot."
"Its name, ""Casineria"", is a latin version of ""Cheese Bay"", the site near Edinburgh, where it was found."
Discovery.
"In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil waited at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. In 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone."
The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in 1999.
Phylogenetic relationship.
"""Casineria"" shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods, notably a generally gracile (slim) build with light leg-bones, unfused ankles and toes ending in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts. This indicates a mainly terrestrial lifestyle. These traits shows it was closely related to amniotes."
"With its advanced features, ""Casineria"" may have been one of the very first true amniotes, that is, egg-layers before the split between Synapsids and Sauropsids. ""Casineria"" pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much further than was previously realized."
"""Casineria"" and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land."
Protoclepsydrops
"Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago. Its remains were found at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site. The dating of this site has been debated, with dates from 320 million years ago (mya) to 305 mya being suggested.p39 It is now settled as 314.5–313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years.p40"
"The skeletal remains of ""Protoclepsydrops"" suggest it may have been a synapsid. If so, it is the oldest synapsid known, though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary. ""Protoclepsydrops"" lived slightly earlier than ""Archaeothyris"", which was definitely a synapsid. Like ""Archaeothyris"", ""Protoclepsydrops"" had a body shape which resembled modern lizards."
Paleothyris
"Paleothyris was a small, agile, anapsid reptile which lived in the Pennsylvanian epoch in Nova Scotia (about 312 to 304 million years ago)."
"""Paleothyris"" had sharp teeth and large eyes: it was a nocturnal hunter. It was about a foot long. It probably fed on insects and other smaller animals found on the floor of its forest home."
"""Paleothyris"" was an early sauropsid, yet it still had some features that were more labyrinthodont-like than reptile-like. Its skull lacked fenestrae, holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals."
Amy Brenneman
"Amy Frederica Brenneman (born June 22, 1964) is an American producer and actor. She is best known for starring in ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Judging Amy"". She has also starred in many movies. She was born in Connecticut."
Westlothiana
"Westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod. It is a transitional fossil, with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters.282 Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards. It lived during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago."
"The type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate, Scotland, in 1984. It was named after the County of West Lothian where it was found."
"""Westlothiania"" in life."
"This species probably lived near a freshwater lake, probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail."
"Together with ""Casineria"", another transitional fossil found in Scotland, it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length."
"The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote, as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. There are derived (advanced) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians. These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth, a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull."
Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey
"Monkwearmouth–Jarrow was a combination of two English monasteries run as a single community. Both were founded by Benedict Biscop. Monkwearmouth, built first, was a magnificent example of the Roman style of architecture. It housed one of the first stained glass works in England. Jarrow became the center of Anglo-Saxon learning in the north of England and contained the largest library in Anglo-Saxon England. Bede, the great Anglo-Saxon scholar, studied, taught and wrote there. The sister Anglo-Saxon monasteries were the UK nomination for World Heritage Site status in 2011."
History.
"In 674 Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, built a monastery known as Monkwearmouth. Egfrith, King of Northumbria gave him fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This monastery would be dedicated to Saint Peter and came to be called St. Peter's at Monkwearmouth. Benedict wanted his monastery to be a center of both learning and religion. Benedict used Frankish stonemasons who he brought over to England to construct the monastery. Monkwearmouth was the first (and Jarrow the second) church structures to be built of stone in England. Benedict them brought over glassmakers from Frankia to fit the windows of the church and chapels with fine stained glass. They established a workshop there at Monkwearwolf. Within a year the monastery was completed. In 678 a letter from Pope Agatho exempted the monastery from external control. Benedict got all the , sacred vessels, decorations and . Some he found locally while others he bought in Francia and Rome. In 682 King Egfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The dedication ceremony for Jarrow abbey was held on 23 April 685. Named for Saint Paul when the sister monastery was completed Benedict assigned Ceolfrith to the abbot. Bede, who was about ten years old at the time, was one of the monks who went with him. King Egfrid, who was at the dedication, died in battle against the Picts less than a month later. The two sister abbeys, only seven miles apart, were thought of as one."
"The library that Benedict started made it possible for Bede to write his works including his famous ""Ecclesiastical History of the English People"".information from. There wasn't another library like it in England. By the time of his death in 689 Benedict had completed four trips to Rome and the south and brought back large collections of books each time. The full extent of Bede's work would still not be possible if not for Ceolfrid, the fourth abbot. He doubled the size of the library left by Benedict Biscop."
"The at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow was kept very busy. There was a growing demand for copies of bibles, books, documents and especially the works of Bede. Requests came in from other parts of England and the . Works from the scriptorium would be found in Leningrad, Rome, and other parts of Europe. Under increasing requests for its products, the Monkwearmouth-Jarrow scriptorium adopted a faster script style used in later works."
"In 794, just a year after the Vikings sacked Lindisfarne, the Vikings attacked Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. The flames were so hot the glass was melted. Both sites were abandoned for a time. Their location on the coast of Northumbria made them easy targets for Viking raids. The twin monasteries were rebuilt. Unlike many old ruins that disappear over time, the old walls of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow can still be seen. They are next to or part of the modern buildings that replaced the original buildings built in 674 and 682."
Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)
"""Wrecking Ball"" is a song performed by Miley Cyrus. It was released on August 25, 2013. ""Wrecking Ball"" is a pop song which is about the ending of a relationship. It was thought to be inspired by Cyrus' former engagement to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth. ""Wrecking Ball"" was the Vevo record with most views in the first 24 hours after its release, and the record for being the fastest clip to reach 100 million views on the service. The record was broken in 2014 by Anaconda of Nicki Minaj."
The song was controversial for the music video that had Cyrus naked and riding a wrecking ball.
Troublemaker (Olly Murs song)
"""Troublemaker"" is a song by Olly Murs. He also wrote the song. It was released on October 12, 2012. The song features Flo Rida. ""Troublemaker"" was a major commercial success. It was a success across the United Kingdom and the United States. It also served as the closing song at Murs's 2013 arena tour."
Green Acres
"Green Acres is an American sitcom that was produced by Filmways and released by Orion Pictures (now Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer).

The show also had supporting roles by Tom Lester, Frank Cady, Pat Buttram, Alvy Moore, Hank Patterson, Barbara Pepper, and several others. ""Green Acres"" is a sister show to ""Petticoat Junction"" which also takes place in Hooterville."
"""Green Acres"" was created by Jay Sommers who was also a writer and executive producer for ""Petticoat Junction"". The idea of ""Green Acres"" came from a radio show which Sommers directed and produced. The series was first broadcast on CBS on September 15, 1965, and was canceled on April 27, 1971. During its run, ""Green Acres"" had six seasons with a total of 170 episodes."

Ted Kaczynski
"Theodore John ""Ted"" Kaczynski (born May 22, 1942 in Evergreen Park, Illinois) is an American mathematician who was known as the Unabomber. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against people involved with modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, ultimately killing a total of three people and injuring 23 others."
"Kaczynski was born and raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. Kaczynski was accepted to Harvard University at the age of 16. He earned an undergraduate degree. He then earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 at age 25. He resigned two years later."
"In 1971, he moved to a cabin without electricity or running water, in Lincoln, Montana. He lived there while learning survival skills. From 1978 to 1995, Kaczynski sent 16 bombs to targets including universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23."
"Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995. He promised ""to desist from terrorism"" if the Times or the Washington Post published his manifesto."

Nickulas has also played a total of 7 seasons in the NHL; 4 with the Boston Bruins, 2 with the St. Louis Blues and 1 with the Chicago Blackhawks. He won the Calder Cup in 1998 while he was apart of the Boston Bruins farm team, the Providence Bruins."
Halteres
"Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better."
"The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings."
Function.
"Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight."
"They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight."
"Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres."
"The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres."
Development.
"In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene ""Ultrabithorax"" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype."
Convergent evolution.
"The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the ""forewings"" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the ""hindwings"" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution."
"Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and ""in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight""."

Narrative poetry
Narrative poetry is a type of poetry that tells a story. Narrative poems can be short or long. Some are novels or short stories written in verse form. Many older narrative poems were designed to be passed on through generations as a way of recording history.
Bothwell Castle
"Bothwell Castle is a large medieval castle in Scotland. It is sited on a high, steep bank, above a bend in the River Clyde, in South Lanarkshire. It is located between Uddingston and Bothwell, about south-east of Glasgow. The castle was built in the 13th century by the ancestors of Clan Murray. It was built to guard a strategic crossing point of the Clyde. Bothwell played a key role in Scotland's Wars of Independence. It changed hands several times."
Velpur
Velpur is a village in India. It is in the state of Andhra Pradesh in the West Godavari district.
Child labour
"Child labour means that children are forced to work like adults and take part in an economic activity. According to the ILO International Labour Organization the term is applied to people up to age thirteen, or seventeen in case of dangerous work. Only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention, but the age limits are generally accepted."
"When children work like adults, this will deprive them of their childhood: Very often, they cannot attend regular school either. This kind of work is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful."
"Child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children, like guarding other children, or helping here and there. Child labour is forbidden in most countries. In some places minor boys and girls work in tea stalls, restaurants, hotels and other small shops. Some work in huge factories like brick factories. The main reason why child labour occurs is poverty."
There are two kinds of work that minors can do:
"In general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour. Estimates are that up to 350 million children are affected by child labour. Eight million of these are affected by the worst forms of child labour: they are child soldiers, they are forced into child prostitution, they are used for child pornography, they are child slaves, debt bondage or affected by human trafficking."
"Often such cases are known through scandals in the mass media. In that manner, a working child is often seen as a slave, working in a Sweet shop in a third world country, producing textiles, or as one of the street children in South America. The reality is different though: Such shops exist all over the world, also in countries like the United States or Italy. The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden: More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture, or it has to do with activities done at home, in the context of the family. If child-slaves exist, they are only a minority. This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation, the two phenomena have made it more visible."
Cash crop
"A cash crop is a crop that is grown to be sold on the market. This is different from a subsistence crop which is grown for the personal use of the farmer, or as food for the farmer's animals."
"There are several different categories of cash crops, for different purposes."
Foods.
"Food crops are grown to be eaten by humans or animals. Since modern agriculture(farming) methods allow farmers to grow much more food than they need to feed themselves and their families, the extra is sold to others."
Some food crops include:
Spices and Herbs.
"Spices and herbs are ingredients added to food in order to make it taste less bland. Spices/herbs do not make up much of a meal but are very flavorful. Since spices/herbs are used in small amounts but can be grown in much larger quantities, the surplus grown is sold as a cash crop."
Some spices/herbs include:
Materials.
"Material crops are plants which have parts that can be used as raw materials to create objects with. Material crops are not eaten, but sold to the market for usage for various purposes."
Some material crops include:
Medicinal/Drug.
Nigger
"Nigger is a racist insult against black people. It can also be referred to as the ""hard R"", due to the word ending in 'er' instead of 'a', like the word with a similar meaning - ""nigga"". Like the word ""nigga"", it can be used in pop culture slang. However, it is mainly used by those who believe that white people are better than everybody else."
"The word came from a slang pronunciation of ""negro"", which is the word for the color black and for black people in Spanish and Portuguese. Before 1865, most black people in the United States were slaves. During this time, the word ""nigger"" usually meant a slave. Writers such as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens used it."
"Today, the word is an offensive racial slur in English, and is often thought as hate speech. ""Nigger"" has become so offensive to say that most people do not use the word; instead, they call it the ""N-word""."
Biography
"A biography is the story of a person's life. The word comes from the Greek words ""bios"" (which means life) and ""graphein"" (which means write). When the biography is written by the person it is about, it is called an autobiography."
A written biography is a part of literature. Biographies can also be made as movies (often called biopics) or told as stories.
"The oldest written biographies that historians have were written to record rulers' lives. Some were written in Assyria, ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. Biographies were an early form of history. Another early form of biography was called ""hagiography,"" meaning writing about holy people."
"In ancient China, a biography was one of the basic forms of a history book. In India, biographies of Buddha and his reincarnated lives were written. In ancient Greece, people wrote biographies of people that were not rulers too. Xenophon wrote a biography of Socrates and gave this book the name ""Memorabilia"" (Memories). During the Roman Empire, Plutarch wrote ""Parallel Lives"" about ancient Greek and Roman politicians, and Suetonius wrote biographies of the Roman emperors. The Gospels were also biographies of Jesus Christ."
"In West Africa, griots tell histories which often include biographies."
Many written biographies today are released by publishers as products for sale.
Ralph Nader

Jamie Farr
"Jamie Farr (born July 1, 1934) is an American actor of Lebanese descent. He is best known for his role as Corp./later Sgt. Maxwell Q. Klinger on the 1970s TV show, ""M*A*S*H"". His real name is Jameel Joseph Farha and he was born in Toledo, Ohio."
"Farr also appeared in movies like ""The Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""The Cannonball Run"" (1980), was a regular ""celebrity judge"" on ""The Gong Show"" and has a golf tournament named after him."
Free software
"Free software is software (computer program) that anyone may run, share and change, at any time, for any reason. In this case, ""free"" means ""freedom-respecting"" (we say ""free as in freedom""). The opposite of free software is proprietary software."
"In 1984, Richard Stallman started the free software movement when he began the GNU project. Examples of free software are Linux (the kernel), Blender, OpenBSD, Inkscape and others. Wikipedia also uses free software."
Free software and open source.
"Free software is very similar, but different from open source software."
People who use the name “free software” think that computers should be more ethical and should try to help people who use computers. They think every human should have four basic rights for their programs. These are the rights to:
The Free software movement also says that all software should be free (as in freedom). It is because even a very small program that is proprietary can be very dangerous (it can for example spy on the user).
"People who use the name “open source” refer to the same software following the same rules, but the community isn't as strict and doesn't say that everything should be open source. They avoid the ethics and instead say the rules are good because they help companies make business."
How free software works.
"An author who wants to make his computer program free must allow other people to use it for anything (which doesn't break the law), study it, change it and share it without limits. The author does this by using a free license."
"The author must not prohibit even selling his program by others or using his program for dangerous things or using it by people he doesn't like. This is not because the author supports bad things, but because he thinks that limiting user's rights is dangerous for them."
Free software and freeware.
"The term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless vest, but expanded to other types of garment over time."
Plain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside suit jackets as a less formal version of the waistcoat or vest that restrains the necktie when the jacket has been removed.

"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc."
"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), also known as the “Betamax case”, is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that the making of individual copies of complete television shows for purposes of time shifting does not constitute copyright infringement, but is fair use."
"The Court also ruled that the manufacturers of home video recording devices, such as Betamax or other VCRs cannot be found guilty for infringement. The case was a boon to the home video market, as it created a legal safe haven for the technology."
Betamax
"Betamax (also called Beta) is a videotape format created by Sony. It was first released on May 10, 1975 in Japan and November of 1975 in the United States. Because it lost the videotape format war to VHS, Betamax is now obsolete. Despite this, production of new Betamax recorders went until 2002; and Betamax cassettes were available up until March 2016."

Sardinia is divided in eight provinces:
Nuclear reactor
"A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat. There are different designs which use different fuels. Most often, uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels."
"Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity. In nuclear power plants heat from the fission reactions in the reactor changes water into steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity. As with other steam engines, the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam."
Some reactors are used for other purposes. Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes. Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work.
The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi. This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb. The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951. It made just enough electricity for four light globes.
"Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have. There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors. However they produce electricity cheaply, and do not pollute the air. There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors: Windscale (UK) 1957, Mayak (USSR) 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) 1979, Chernobyl (USSR) 1986 and Fukushima (Japan) 2011. Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power. There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5% of the world's electricity."
Samobor
"Samobor is a city in Zagreb County, Croatia, population 36,206 It is west of Zagreb, between the eastern slopes of Samoborsko gorje (Samobor hills, the eastern part of the Žumberak Mountains), in the Sava river valley. It is part of the Zagreb metropolitan area."
"Samobor has been there since 1242, according to a document of endowment by King Bela IV. It is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, oriented towards anglers, hunters and hikers."
Frankfurt (Oder)
"Frankfurt (Oder) or Frankfurt an der Oder (; abbreviated """", , Low Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Odru"", , Upper Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Wódru"", lit. 'Frankfurt at the Oder') is a town in Germany. It lies on the Oder river, which marks the current border between Germany and Poland (The so-called Oder-Neisse line). It's in the east of the state of Brandenburg."
"In January 1999, the town added a prefix ""Kleiststadt"" to refer to Heinrich von Kleist, who was born there in 1777. Today, about 65,000 people are living in Frankfurt an der Oder."
Cook Islands
"The Cook Islands are a group of islands in the southern Pacific. They form an independent state, but have strong ties with New Zealand. The 15 small islands have a total land surface of 240 square kilometers. About 18.000 people live on the islands, most of them from tourism. The largest island, Rarotonga, also holds the territory's capital, Avarua."
"The nation also has a distinctive Polynesian language known as Cook Island Maori, which is closely related to the Maori language of New Zealand and to the Tahitian language."
"Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century. This came from a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley challenged the safety of benzoate. In response, business owners, particularly Henry J. Heinz, pursued a different recipe that did not use that preservative."
"Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin. This was due to the use of unripe tomatoes. Those tomatoes were low in pectin. They were less vinegary than modern ketchups. By pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated. There was also no spoiled ketchup or loss in flavor. The changes also helped make it an important American condiment according to some experts."
"Until Heinz, most commercial ketchups appealed to two of the basic tastes: bitterness and saltiness. But the switch to ripe tomatoes and more tomato solids added a stronger ""umami"" taste. The major increase in the concentration of vinegar added sourness and pungency to the range of sensations experienced while eating it."
"In the past, ketchup was produced from fresh tomatoes after harvesting. Vacuum evaporation made it possible to turn tomatoes into a very thick tomato paste. This made it easy to store at room temperature. This allows a factory to produce ketchup throughout the year."
Later innovations.
"In fast food chains, ketchup is often put in small packets that hold ketchup inside. Users tear the side or top of the packet. They then squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets. In 2010, Heinz is offering an alternate squeeze and dip cup. This is meant to offer a cleaner method of dispensing the product."
"In an earlier approach, some fast food outlets dispense ketchup from pumps into paper cups. Some restaurants still use this method."
"In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt. They included green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue colored ketchup. These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. these products have been discontinued."
Standards and Regulations.
Regulations in Canada.
"In Canadian markets, the manufacturing of ketchup is regulated by the Food and Drug Regulation. Ketchup, a heat processed product, must be made from the juice of red-ripe tomatoes or sound tomato trimmings where the skins and seeds have been removed. The ketchup must contain vinegar, salt, seasoning and a sweetening ingredient. They may also contain a class II preservative and food colouring, though not required."
Regulations in the United States.
"In the United States, ketchup is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ketchup must be prepared from a tomato concentrate, juice from mature red Lycopersicum esculentum tomatoes or liquid residue from preparing tomatoes for canning or partial juice extractions. The tomato skins, seeds and other hard substances must be strained. Additionally, ketchup must contain any combination of vinegars, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and/or spices, flavouring, onions or garlic."

Danish can mean:
Birthday
"A birthday is the day when a person was born. In many places, on a person's birthday, he or she celebrates with friends and family at a party, where they eat cake or other foods, and get gifts."
Western birthdays.
"Not everyone celebrates birthdays, including Jehovah's Witnesses."
"In many English-speaking countries, people sing the song ""Happy Birthday to You"" to the person celebrating her or his birthday. There are similar songs in other languages."
"A birthday cake is usually decorated and covered with candles. Most of the time, the number of candles is the same as the age of the birthday person."
Coming of age.
Children usually reach their age of majority on a birthday.
"In South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice)."
"In Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as 柚子茶 (Youzi cha)."
[Note: The Korean Yuja is the same as the Japanese Yuzu 柚子 and must be different from the citron being described in this article. The Japanese Yuzu = Citrus junos.]
Citric acid
"Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits ( like oranges). It is used by organisms for Krebs cycle. It acts like a preservative when added to food. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks. In the European Union it is known as E 330, as a food additive."
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is C6H8O7."
Geber
"Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (; ; died between 806 and 816), is the name for the writer of a great number of writings in Arabic. The writings together have the name Jabirian corpus. The most important subjects of these writings are: alchemy, cosmology, numerology, astrology, medicine, magic, mysticism, and philosophy."
"Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of chemical substances. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance (ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair)."
"Modern scholars doubt the historical existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a pseudonym that a group of writers used."
"Translations into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the ""Book of Mercy"", and the ""Book of Seventy"") came into existence in the Middle Ages. In Latin, Jabir had the name ""Geber"", a transliteration of ""Jabir""."
"In 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, called pseudo-Geber, started to produce new writings about alchemy under the name Geber. People still read the in the 17th century. The """" was one of the writings that pseudo-Geber produced in the 13th century. It was an influence on early modern chemists like Robert Boyle (1627–1691)."
Carl Wilhelm Scheele
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele (December 9, 1742 - May 21, 1786) a German-Swedish pharmaceutical chemist, born in Stralsund, Western Pomerania, Germany (at the time under Swedish rule), was the discoverer of many chemical substances, most notably discovering oxygen before Joseph Priestley and chlorine before Humphry Davy."

For example: Mozart wrote a trio for piano, clarinet and viola which is usually called a “clarinet trio”. Brahms wrote a trio for piano, violin and French horn which is usually called a “horn trio”."
Music for three people to play at one piano is called music for piano six hands.
Famous music for piano trio.
"Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote several piano trios for the traditional combination of piano, violin and cello. Beethoven’s last piano trio has the nickname ""Archduke"" because it was written for the Archduke Rudolph. Franz Schubert wrote two beautiful piano trios."

Bihu
"Bihu is the most prominent festival celebrated by the people of Assam. It is a set of three celebrations performed throughout the year. The three Bihus are celebrated at different times of year, in the months of Bohaag (Baisakhi), Kaati (Kartik) and Maagh, according to Hindu calendar. As per modern calendar these days fall in the month of mid April, October/ November and early January."
"Assam is a small state in the north-eastern part of the country. Its economy is mainly based on agriculture. The inhabitants of Assam are known agrarians from ages. Hence all their daily activities and celebrations are agriculture oriented only. Bihu is also one of such festivals. It is very much evident from the months of celebration of this festival that these months are actually significant in relation with farming of native crop of Assam, the paddy. Bohaag bihu is celebrated at the seeding time of paddy. Kaati bihu is celebrated when the sowing of paddy is complete and the transformation of the saplings is done. Maagh bihu represents the culmination of the harvesting period of the crop."
"The word bihu is derived from the language of ‘dimasa kacharis’, which is the agricultural community of Assam, since ages. The word was originally ‘Bishu’, which meant ‘to ask for prosperity’ from the tribal god. Bihu is the distorted version of Bishu."
"Bohaag bihu is also known as Rongali bihu and celebrated with the highest joy and mirth among all the three bihus. As stated it is the commencement time of the new season of farming. But along with, Bohaag is the first month according to Assamese calendar. Hence it is also celebrated as the New Year festival. This period also marks the transition in the seasonal cycle and people greet the coming season of spring with enthusiasm. Rongali bihu is celebrated over a period of 7 days. There are various phases and significance of the respective 7 days of the bihu. The first day is known as goru bihu (cows are washed and worshipped). This is followed by manuha bihu (human beings take early day bath and wear new attire). Then on third day deities are worshipped and washed. Hence the festival stretches over a span of time and the celebrations culminate by bidding adieu to bihu on the last day of festival."
"Kati bihu is also known as kongali bihu. It is celebrated with solidarity. However, the celebrations are quietest of all the three bihus. The farmers are busy in their paddy fields and earthen lamps are lit to mark the celebrations. Farmers pray for a better crop during this time of the farming cycle."
"Maagh bihu is also known as Bhogaali bihu. Bhogalli means eating and enjoyment. Hence the name itself implies the mood of the festival. Men folk prepare cottages in the barren fields after harvesting of the crops and spend whole night while singing and dancing in communion. Delicious food and sweets are exchanged among the people. In the very next morning, the cottage is lit up in fire and this brings an end to yearly festival of bihu."
"It is quite evident that bihu is a festival of farming community whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon the agriculture. The festival of bihu is celebrated by one and all in Assam. The boundaries of rich or poor, cast creed etc are diminished in the dazzling light of joy and merriment."

"In ""Liber Pontificalis"", it says that they ascribe a decree to Pope Eleutherius that no kind of food should be despised by Christians(Et hoc iterum firmavit ut nulla esca a Christianis repudiaretur, maxime fidelibus, quod Deus creavit, quæ tamen rationalis et humana est)."
Underground cable
"An underground cable is a cable that is buried below the ground. They distribute electrical power or telecommunications. Such cables are an alternative to overhead cables, which are several meters above the ground. Overhead cables are often replaced with underground cables. Downtown areas with many tall buildings usually have few or no cables above ground, This is mainly for aesthetic purposes because underground cables can not be seen. They are also less dangerous to people because they are out of the way. They cost more to install, but last longer."

Garret FitzGerald
"Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 1926 – 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who served twice as Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1982 to 1987. Elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Teachta Dála (TD), he served as Ireland's foreign minister from 1973 to 1977 and as leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987."
Early life.
"FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, His mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent."
"He was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD). A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer), a fellow student whom FitzGerald would marry in 1947."
He later qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.
Early political life.
"FitzGerald was eager to enter politics and, although it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil (including Charles Haughey) that he should join them, he made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency."
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
"After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, however the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, with his innovative views, energy and fluency in the French language, won Ireland a status in European affairs far beyond the country's size and ensured that the first Irish presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success."
Leader of Fine Gael.
"In 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him."
"Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas than Fianna Fáil, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years."
Taoiseach 1981–82.
"By the time of the 1981 general election, Fine Gael won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981."
"Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed region in the South Caucasus. Legally, it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but from 1994 until the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, most of it was militarily controlled by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, which is not officially recognized by any other country, including Armenia which supports it. Currently, different parts of the region are controlled by both Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Azerbaijan controlling most of it and Armenia controlling a smaller central area."
Etymology.
"The names for the region in the different local languages all translate to ""mountainous Karabakh"", or ""mountainous black garden"". The word ""nagorno"" is Russian for ""mountainous/on the mountain"", ""kara"" is Turkish for ""black"", and ""bakh"" means ""garden"" in Azerbaijani."
History.
"The region became a subject of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1918 when both states gained brief independence. Two years later, Soviet Union conquered both of the new states and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within Azerbaijan."
"When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow and started campaigns of publicity and democratic reforms at the end of the 20th century, Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh sent letters to Gorbachev demanding him to move the autonomous oblast to the control of Armenia. When it was declined, the Armenians started an independence movement."
"In November 1991, seeking to stop this movement, the Parliament of Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous status of the region. In response, the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians held a referendum on December 10, 1991, which was boycotted by Azerbaijanis living in Nagorno-Karabakh and none of them participated in it, therefore the overwhelming majority of the population voted for independence."

"James Christopher Read (born July 31, 1953) is an American actor. He acted in many movies and television series. He is best known for the ""North and South"" miniseries (1985, 1986, 1994). He was born in Buffalo, New York."
Filmography.
The following is some of the movies and television programms Read has been in.
Satyr play
"Satyr plays were an ancient Greek form of theatre, similar in spirit to burlesque. They featured choruses of satyrs, were based on Greek mythology, and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including phallic props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment."
Premier League
"The Premier League, commonly known as the English Premier League, or the EPL (formerly called the Barclays Premier League due to sponsorship reasons and before 2007 the Premiership) is the top tier of English football. 20 teams compete in the Premier League each season, which is usually played between August and May. Each season, 38 games are played (playing all 19 other teams home and away). For historic reasons, a few clubs from Wales also compete in the English football system."
"The competition started in 1992, after 22 clubs from the Football League First Division decided to break away from The Football League (now the EFL). The Premier League has since become the world's most watched sporting league. It is the world's most lucrative football league, with combined club revenues of £1.93 billion ($3.15bn) in 2007–08. It is also ranked second by UEFA's Association Ranking, behind La Liga."
2022–23 season.
"Twenty clubs will compete in the 2022–23 Premier League, with three promoted from the Championship:"
a: Founding member of the Premier League
b: Never been relegated from Premier League
c: One of the original 12 Football League teams

"The body of the wild boar, when seen from the side, often looks very big. This impression is partly because, compared to the large body mass, the legs of the wild boar are short and do not look very strong. The wild boar's head is very large. Its eyes are high up on the head, while the ears are small with bristles around it. Its tail can move very quickly, and the wild boar often uses it to show when his mood. If seen from the front, the body looks quite narrow. The wild boar has 44 teeth in its jaw, which helps its strong bite. The male and the female wild boars' snout shapes are different."
Piglets.
A wild boar usually gives birth to about 4 – 6 piglets at a time. Piglets weigh from about 750 – 1000g when they are first born. They are fully weaned after 3 – 4 months. They begin eating solid foods such as worms and grubs after about 2 weeks.
In culture.
"Wild boar appears in European culture as symbol of warrior virtues. It also appears in Greek, Norse mythologies, vaishnavism, hinduism."
Narasimha
"Narasimha, according to Hinduism, was the fourth avatar of Vishnu. In this form, Vishnu had the body of a man, but he had a head of a lion. This avatar of Vishnu is also a symbol of great strength."
"The Hindu scriptures tell this story about Narashimha. There was a demon (a ""daitya"") named Hiranyakashipu. He was against all gods. But, his son named Prahlad used to worship the gods, especially Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death. Hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead. Vishnu became Narasimha, and protected Prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping Hiranyakashipu. Brahma had granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that kept him safe so that he could not be killed by a human, animal or deva. He also could not be killed in the day or night, or inside or outside of his palace. This made Hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him. When he wanted to kill his son for worshiping Vishnu, Vishnu came to earth incarnated as a half-man, half-lion creature (neither man nor human). This way Vishnu killed Hiranyakashipu in the twilight (neither day, nor night) and on the porch of the palace (neither inside, nor outside), without disrupting the boon given to him by Brahma. Now, Narasimha Jayanti is celebrated across the world."
Prahlada
"Hindus believe that Prahlada was a good person. He was the son of Hiranyakashipu, his evil father, and he worshipped Vishnu. Narasimha protected him from Hiranyakashipu."
Yuga
"Hindus believe that there are periods of time called yugas (""ages"" or ""eras""): Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. When Kali Yuga ends, a new Satya Yuga begins."
Vamana
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Vamana avatar was the fifth avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human.Vamana avatar is basically in the form of a bramhin(a caste in hinduism which is responsible for ancient spiritual, cultural, educational activitiesand the highest in the Varnas) was taken for a demon king 'Bali'. Lord Vishnu in this avatar asked Bali to offer him 'three feet land' as a form of offering a king offered to a brahmin as a goodwill during ancient times in hindu culture. The story goes when king Bali captured the Adobe of hindu demigods and caused them a fierce battle. 'Aditi' - the mother figure of demigods in hinduism prayed to Lord Vishnu and pleased by her prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared and assured her a boon. In a thought of revenge , she wished that may Bali loose his whole wealth and power."""
"Lord Vamana (lord Vishnu) when asked Bali for three feet land then Bali laughed and said ""Brahamandeva (O Brahmin) you might have asked many luxurious things from me as dakshina but you asked such a menial thing of land of a three feet quantity?"" After which Lord Vamana grew so large in size as his one feet could cover whole Earth and other whole heaven! That means, whole land property of Bali was under control of lord Vamana. As per Bali's oath, there was no more land to donate and one feet of lord was remaining. Bali asked lord about who is greater, the thing or who gives the thing? Lord answer was the donar or giver of the thing is greater than the thing. Then king Bali asked the Lord to keep his third feet on his (Bali) head! Pleased by this act of Bali lord promised him the rule of 'Patal' (the underEarth) and promised to protect Bali and his kingdom and slay whosoever disobeys Bali in patal."
"It is believed that for 3 day during 'savan'or rainy season , king Bali returns to Earth. These three days are celebrated as Onam in Indian state of 'kerala'. During this festival , the idols of lord Vishnu and king bali are made out of rice and worshiped. A famous boat race is also organised across kerala in honour of king Bali. The people from every faith in kerala celebrate this feast. It is a regional festival of Keralites."
Parashurama
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Parashurama also known as parshurama avatar was the sixth important avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human. He came to Earth to stop bad people. He was the son of sage Jamdagni, a sage who was known for his temper. It is believed that parashurma was cheiranjiv it means that he was immortal. He was the great devotee of Lord Shiva. Parshurama's mother Renuka Devi was daughter of kshatriya after receiving Parashurma from Lord Shiva as a boon it was impossible to defeat parashurma in Earth. He was the first brahmakshatriya (both brahmin and kshatriya warrior)"
It is said that he was born before the Lord Rama and still he is alive.In Mahabharata he tought
Dronacharya Bhishma and karna.It is believed that he will teach war skills to the tenth avatar of Vishnu (kalki) once he cutt of the right tusk of Lord Ganesha.
Because Ganesha was not letting him in to meet Lord Shiva when Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva grew up with anger after hearing this but after they forgive parashurma.
Balarama
"Hindus believe that Balram was the older brother of Krishna. Some Hindus believe that he is an avatar of Vishnu’s shesh naag. In this avatar, Shesh naag was in the form of a human."
Ba Ðình Square
"Ba Đình Square (Vietnamese: Quảng Trường Ba Đình) is a place in the Vietnamese capital, Hà Nội. It is where Vietnamese President Hồ Chí Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam from French imperialist rule on 2 September 1945, the same day that World War II ended. This is now where his mausoleum is."
"On 17 June 2018, North Macedonia and Greece agreed to the Prespa agreement which would see the country change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. The government started completing the constitutional change needed to change the country's name, which was completed on 12 February 2019."
Politics.
North Macedonia is a democratic country with a parliament.
Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia) is an eating disorder.
"People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming fat even if they are very skinny. To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough. When they do eat, they do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to lose too much weight too quickly. This is very harmful to a person's body. There are various treatments for anorexia. One example is the Maudsley Method. This type of treatment is for patients who are 18 or younger. Two thirds of adolescent anorexia patients are 'recovered' at the end of this treatment. People with anorexia are more likely to die than people with any other mental illness."
Diagnosis.
"Doctors use the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" to make a medical diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia."
Causes.
"There is no single cause of anorexia. Researchers believe that it is caused by a combination of biological and environmental factors. It has been linked to the media. Many people think that anorexia is caused by wanting to be thin like models in magazines. However, it is not that simple."
"People who develop anorexia tend to be perfectionistic. They are also more likely to have problems socializing. There has been research about the link between anorexia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder that involves problems with socializing. Another symptom of autism spectrum disorder is OCD, which has also been linked to anorexia. Starvation is known to create antisocial behavior so there needs to be research that compares those traits in anorexics with people who have recovered."
Madness
Madness (or Insanity) is a word that can have different meanings:
"Being able to tell right from wrong is the base of a working society and of law; for this reason, the law treats those people differently who are not able to make this distinction. In the law, when people who can’t understand that their crimes are crimes it’s called the insanity defense."
Rabies
"Rabies is a neurotropic (referring to the nuerons) virus, viral zoonotic disease (can spread to humans by animals) that causes acute encephalitis."
"The disease is almost always fatal (people and animals die from it) when the symptoms start. There is no treatment and cure for it when the symptoms occur. However, people (and pets) who are treated with vaccines soon after becoming infected have a very good chance to survive."
"The disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood. The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal. Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries."
Treatment.
"There is no cure for rabies. There is a vaccine (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it. The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux in 1885. This vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits, and weakened (through drying it). The first person to be vaccinated was Joseph Meister (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog). Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using cell cultures) are more used."
"There is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten. It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten. There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late. Treatment starts with washing the wound. This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body. Often patients are given one dose of immunoglobulin and a certain number of vaccines, over a determined period of time, usually a month."
Tirana
"Tirana ( or ""Tirana"") is the capital city of Republic of Albania. It is the largest city in that country. According to 2011 census, the population of the city was 621,286 people. Other people think there may be up to 1 million people who live in the city. Tirana was founded in 1614. It became Albania's capital city in 1920."
"The origin of the city name is unknown. According to one of the versions, its name comes from Tyrkanos Castle, which was near the current location of Tirana."
John Forbes Nash Jr.
"John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who worked in game theory and differential geometry. He was born in Bluefield, West Virginia. He shared the 1994 Memorial Prize in Economics with two other game theorists, Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi."
Early life.
Piano Duos.
"Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos. These are usually called piano duos. Examples include Mozart’s Sonata in D major K448. The Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms started as a string quintet but he changed it to a piano concerto, then a piano duo, and eventually a piano quintet. The Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff is another. Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists. Piano concertos can be played on two pianos, with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestra’s music."
Piano Six Hands.
"There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano. This is called Piano six hands. These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play, although there are examples of serious pieces. The three people need to be good friends, because it is a bit of a squash. The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it."
Piano six hands
"Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano, and from piano trio which is music for piano, violin and cello. Not much music has been written for this combination, although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces."
Examples.
"Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's op.17 and 741, Jean Cras's ""Âmes d’enfants"", Paul Robinson (composer)'s ""Pensees"" and ""Monmartre"", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs, Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's ""Metrorhythmia 1"", John Pitts's ""Are You Going?"", Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's ""Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich"", Canadian composer Paul Frehner's ""Slowdown"" and Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi's ""Promenade""."
Pedal
"A pedal is something that is made to work by someone's foot. The word ""pedal"" comes from the Latin word for ""foot"". Many things can be made to work by pedals. These include:"
Rice wine
"Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks. However, it is not a true wine, despite the name. True wine is made by fermenting grapes, and perhaps other fruit. In rice wine, the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar. This sugar is then fermented. This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer."
"The ""rice wines"" made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines (18–25% alcohol compared to 10–14% for normal wines). Beers on the other hand usually have 4–8% alcohol in them."
"Many people use the term ""rice wine"" to refer to sake (which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines)."
Alcopop
"Alcopops are alcoholic drinks. They are also known as Ready-to-drink (RTD), Flavored Alcoholic Beverage (FAB) or Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB). They are usually available in bottles or cans. They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer. Usually, they are very sweet, so that the alcohol can not be tasted."
"There are two different kinds of this drinks. In Europe, they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade, like vodka with lemon juice (and a lot of sugar, so the alcohol cannot be tasted), or rum with fruit juice (also very sweet). In the US, they tend to be beers, which taste very sweet."
"Because they are very sweet, alcopops tend to be more popular among young people. Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste, these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries. These have either raised the taxes on the drinks, or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age (usually 18, sometimes 21 years)."
Pedal (music)
"Pedals on musical instruments are used to control parts of the instrument, or provide extra notes."
There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons.
Piano.
"The piano has at least two pedals; large concert grand pianos always have three. The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed. It does this by lifting the dampers from the strings. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well (""in sympathy"")."
"The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the ""una corda"" pedal (Italian for ""one string""). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead. On an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard."
"On pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord which the player is holding down when the pedal is pressed will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected."
Organ.
On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.
Map coloring
"Map coloring is a term used for two different concepts: In geography and mapmaking it is used to say that colors are assigned to certain areas on a map. Examples of this are coloring that show the countries or divisions of a country, but also to visualize other data, for example the altitude. The other use is in mathematics: There it is used to describe the problem of finding the minimal number of colors needed to color a given map."
In mapmaking.
"Color is very useful to show different features on a map. Typical uses of color include showing different countries, different temperatures, or different kinds of roads."
"Displaying the information in different colors can affect the understanding or feel of the map. In many cultures, certain colors have certain meanings. For example, red can mean danger, green can mean nature, and blue can mean water, which can be confused with the sea."
"Mapmakers may also use colors that are related to what they are mapping. For example, when mapping where it rains more or less, they may use different shades of blue. For a map of wildfires, they may use yellows, reds, and oranges. Carefully choosing colors is important so the map is easy to read and understand. Also, the mapmaker must take into account that many people have impaired color vision, and colors must be used such that these readers can see their differences."
QED
QED may mean:
Q.E.D.
"Q.E.D. is an acronym or initialism of the Latin phrase , which means ""what was to be demonstrated"". In other words, Q.E.D. means ""something was to be proven, and now it has been done""."
History.
"In the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin. The phrases ""Q.E.D."" was often used at the end of mathematical or philosophical proofs."
Equivalents in other languages.
"""Q.E.D."" is used in many languages, including:"
Five color theorem
"The Five color theorem is a theorem from Graph theory. It states that any plane which is separated into regions, such as a map, can be colored with no more than five colors. It was first stated by Alfred Kempe in 1890, and proved by Percy John Heawood eleven years later. Kempe also tried to prove it, but his proof failed. There are two restrictions which are placed on the maps: First, a country must be contiguous, there must be no exclaves, and secondly, countries that only touch in one point can be colored with the same color."
"There is also a four color theorem, which is stronger, and much more difficult to prove."
Silence procedure
"Silence procedure (French: ""procédure d'approbation tacite"") is a decision-making tactic or process used in international political contexts. The procedure is based on the Latin phrase ""qui tacet consentire videtur"" which means ""he who is silent is taken to agree"" or ""silence means consent""."
"The silence procedure is used to enhance the process of consensus-building. It is used by many international groups, including NATO, and the European Union (EU)."
"In the contexts of such multi-party groups, silence signifies a willingness to work together to limit the possible causes of paralysis."
Ahumada Municipality
"Ahumada is one of the 67 municipalities of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. The municipal seat is Villa Ahumada. The municipality covers an area of 17,131.5 km²."
"As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 11,727."
Villa Ahumada
"Villa Ahumada (officially Miguel Ahumada) is the seat of the Ahumada Municipality in the Chihuahua, Mexico. It had 8,753 inhabitants (2005). It is located along Highway 45, about south of Ciudad Juárez and north of the city of Chihuahua."
FCSB
"FCSB is a football team from Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on 7 June 1947 as ""ASA Bucureşti"" (""ASA Bucharest""). The original FC Steaua București team was part of the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence. FC Steaua București was forced to change its name to FCSB in 2017. It has won the most championships in Romania, 26, and it is the only team from Romania to win a UEFA Champions League title. Its chairman is George Becali (usually ""Gigi"" Becali)."
Chevrolet Express
Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana are full sized passenger or cargo vans made via General Motors. These vans seat between eight and fifteen passengers. The cargo vans are used for commercial and business purposes. The Express/Savana vans were first produced around 1996.
"Weatherford, Texas"
"Weatherford is a city in Parker County, Texas near Fort Worth. It is part of Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area."
Green River Formation
"The Green River Formation is an Eocene rock formation on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes. Its fine fossils make this a lagerstätte, a place of exceptional preservation."
"The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago (mya). During this period the climate moved from the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene."
"The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, in pairs: a dark layer from the growing season, and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter."
"Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm."
"The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah:"
Conditions at the time.
The formation has many evaporites – minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes. This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation.
Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes. Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition.
Climate.
"Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated."
"The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements"
Oil shale.
"The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world. The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 × 10¹¹ m³ (1.5 trillion US barrels) of shale oil. This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried. The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria, which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions."
Fossils.
"The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away. Leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage got during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets."
"The fauna included fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals"
Peggy Lee
"Norma Egstrom (May 26, 1920 - January 21, 2002) was an American actress and jazz singer. She is better known as Peggy Lee. She acted in many movies. She also wrote the music for them. She sang and acted for six decades. Lee was born in Jamestown, North Dakota."
Hurricane Alex (2010)
"Hurricane Alex was a rare June hurricane and the first tropical cyclone of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm first struck near Belize as a tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became a hurricane and struck northeast Mexico; it was the first hurricane in June since Hurricane Allison in 1995. The storm killed 51 people (33 directly) and caused almost $1.9 billion in damage (2010 USD)."
"The parable of the Faithful Servant and parable of the Ten Virgins, adjacent in Matthew, involve waiting for a bridegroom, and have an eschatological theme: be prepared for the day of reckoning. The parable of the Tares the parable of the Rich Fool, the parable of the budding fig tree, and the parable of the barren fig tree also have eschatological themes."
"Other parables stand alone, such as the parable of the unforgiving servant, dealing with forgiveness; the parable of the Good Samaritan, dealing with practical love; and the parable of the Friend at Night, dealing with persistence in prayer."
Art.
"Of the thirty or so parables in the canonical Gospels, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the ""Life of Christ"". These were: the Ten Virgins, the Rich man and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. Artists famous for depicting parables include Martin Schongauer, Pieter the Elder Bruegal and Albrecht Dürer. The Workers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works. From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son became the clear favorite, with the Good Samaritan also popular. Albrecht Dürer made a famous engraving of the ""Prodigal Son"" amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance, and Rembrandt depicted the story several times, although at least one of his works, ""The Prodigal Son in the Tavern"", a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene. His late ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) is one of his most popular works."
Poetry and hymns.
"As well as being depicted in art and discussed in prose, a number of parables form the inspiration for religious poetry and hymns. For example, the hymn ""The Ninety and Nine"" by Elizabeth C. Clephane (1868) is inspired by the parable of the Lost Sheep:"
&lt;poem&gt;
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
"But one was out on the hills away,"
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.&lt;/poem&gt;
"Similarly, ""My Hope Is Built"" (Edward Mote, c. 1834) is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, and ""How Kind the Good Samaritan"" (John Newton, c. 1779) is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan."
Harmony of parables.
"A sample Gospel harmony for the parables based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels is presented in the table below. For the sake of consistency, this table is automatically sub-selected from the main harmony table in the Gospel harmony article, based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels. Usually, no parables are associated with the Gospel of John, just allegories."
Parallels outside the canonical gospels.
"A number of parables have parallels in non-canonical gospels, the Didache, and the letters of Apostolic Fathers . However, given that the non-canonical gospels generally have no time sequence, this table is not a Gospel harmony."
Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree (Luke 13:6–9) written in the New Testament is a parable of Jesus. It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit, unlike the parable of the budding fig tree."
What Jesus said.
Then he told this parable:
What it means.
The owner of the vineyard represents God. The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem (and also for Jesus's church). The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth. The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards.
"The parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins. ""These three years"" refers to the period of his ministry on earth. The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree. Richard Whately commented that this parable ""is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice; once in words, once in action."""
Parable of the Budding Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus. It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:32-35, Mark 13:28-31 and Luke 21:29-33. The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree, the opposite of the barren fig tree."
What Jesus said.
He told them this parable:
Freeport is a city of Florida in the United States.
Geography.
Freeport has a total area of 19 square miles.
"Frostproof, Florida"
Frostproof is a city of Florida in the United States.
Geography.
Frostproof has a total area of 19.3 square miles.
Cache coherence
"A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called ""data integrity""). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence."
"There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory, without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory."

"Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location. The caches are coherent, if all of the following conditions are met:"
"These conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors."
Cache coherence mechanisms.
Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.
"The two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (&gt;64 processors) use this type of cache coherence."

Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
"The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international treaty signed in 2001. The treaty became effective in May 2004. Its aim is to limit the use and production of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Examples of substances affected by the treaty are Polychlorinated biphenyl and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. An extension to the treaty in 2009 added other substances, like Lindane. Critics have said that the treaty limits the effectiveness of the fight against diseases such as malaria. This is not the case, as the use of certain substances for vector control is permitted; this includes the use against mosquitoes."
Chemicals listed.
The following chemicals are listed:
Tokyo Electric Power Company
", also known as or TEPCO, is a Japanese company that sells electrical power in Japan's Kantō region, Yamanashi Prefecture, and the eastern part of Shizuoka Prefecture. This area includes Tokyo. Its headquarters are in Uchisaiwaicho, Chiyoda, Tokyo. It has international offices in Washington, D.C., and London."
"After the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, its power plant at Fukushima Daiichi became a continuing nuclear disaster. The Fukushima disaster forced 50,000 households to leave the evacuation zone because of radiation leaks into the air, soil and sea."
Tokyo Prefecture is the largest shareholder in the company with 9.37 percent voting rights.
Dark Circle
"Dark Circle is a documentary movie about anti-nuclear protest activity. The protest is mainly focused on Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant in California. The point of view is clearly in favor of the protesters. They believe that the protests delayed government licensing of the Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant. They believe that as a result of this delay,construction errors were made public before the plant started operating."
"The director is Judy Irving. The movie is a 1982 release. It is said to be ""still powerful"" long after its initial release."
Protest leader Raye Fleming takes central role. She leaflets power plant workers going to work and later leads protesters. Two thousand people were arrested at the demonstrations. This established a record for anti-nuclear civil disobedience in the US.

"Unlike the early sauropsids, ""Hylonomus"" and its kin, ""Archaeothyris"" was relatively large, measuring head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~reptiles), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged canines, suggesting that it was a carnivore."
"""Archaeothyris"" lived in what is now Nova Scotia, about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period (Pennsylvanian). Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp, similar to today's Everglades in Florida. The 'trees' (actually giant clubmosses) were very tall. Some, such as ""Lepidodendron"", were up to tall. ""Archaeothyris"" and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor."
Ray Milland
Ray Milland (3 January 1907 – 10 March 1986) was a Welsh actor and director.
Career.
"In the early years he achieved success in films such as ""Bulldog Drummond Escapes"" (1937), ""Hotel Imperial"" (1939), ""Beau Geste"" (1939), and ""The Major and the Minor"" (1942) with Ginger Rogers. He was also in ""Ministry of Fear"" (1944), by Fritz Lang. In the Billy Wilder film ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945), he played the role of Don Birnam, an alcoholic writer. That role earned him an Academy Award as best actor."
"In the 1950s he starred in the Alfred Hitchcock film ""Dial M for Murder"" (1954)."
"Another performance was as Oliver Barrett III (1970), in the Arthur Hiller film ""Love Story"" (1970), with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal."
Sci-fi movies.
"In early 1960, Ray Milland started much to play evil characters, in horror and sci-fi movies such as ""Panic in Year Zero!"" (1962), he also directed. ""Premature Burial"" (1962) and """" (1963), by Roger Corman, in ""Frogs"" (1972), he played a man who is attacked by a plague of mutant frogs, ""The Thing with Two Heads"" (1972), he played a doctor who had a head transplant, ""Terror in the Wax Museum"" (1973)."
Television.
"He had a long career in television, including his TV series ""Meet Mr. McNutley"" (1953–54), as Ray McNulty, and the Crime TV series ""Markham"" (1959–60), as Roy Markham a former lawyer, who works as a detective."
"He was a special guest star in ""General Electric Theater"", ""Night Gallery"", ""Columbo"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Fantasy Island"", ""The Love Boat"", ""Hart to Hart"", and many more."
Canine tooth
"Canine teeth are found in mammals. They are the eye teeth, fangs or dogteeth. They are on either side of the incisors. Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart, and also attack and defence."
"In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth."
Premolar
The premolar teeth of mammals are the teeth between the canines and the molars. There are at most a total of eight of them. The number is reduced in the dental formula of many species.
"As the name suggests, they are like smaller molars, and their function is to crush and grind food."
Water park
"A water park (occasionally written as ""waterpark"") is an theme park that features water play areas, such as water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider."
Evolution of water parks.
"Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association)."
"Water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort, a member of the World Water Park Association, is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the communities' destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides. A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented; e.g. Schwaben Quellen, a member of European Waterparks Association (EWA) has no water slides, but instead has many saunas, steam rooms, ""adventure showers"", and relaxation-oriented water play areas."
"From 2000's, popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions. To solve this problem, some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets."
A unique feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion.
Indoor water parks.
"The first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the $1.2 billion dollar Phase III expansion. Called World Waterpark, it is over in size. It also includes one of the world's largest indoor wave pool, waterslides of varying degrees, tube rides, bungee jumping, and hot tubs."
"Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. He studied at Princeton University and at Carnegie Institute of Technology."
Career.
"The winner of a Westinghouse scholarship, he attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he received both his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in 1948. From Pittsburgh he went to Princeton University where he worked on his equilibrium theory. He received a Ph.D. in 1950 with a dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, which was written under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of what would later be called the Nash equilibrium. His studies on this subject led to three articles:"
Nash also did important work in the area of manifolds (complex spatial structures):
"This work led to ""Nash embedding theorem"": ""Two real algebraic manifolds are equivalent if and only if they are analytically homeomorphic."""
Personal life.
"He is best known in popular culture as the subject of the Hollywood movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"", about his mathematical genius and his struggles with schizophrenia, with which he was diagnosed."
"Nash married Alicia Lopez-Harrison de Lardé in 1957. They had one son. Nash had a first son out of wedlock to Elenor Stier.. In 1963, the couple divorced. They later remarried in 2001. Nash lived in West Windsor Township, New Jersey for a long time."
Death.
"On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife Alicia were killed in a car accident near Monroe Township, New Jersey. A taxi that they were riding in was struck by another vehicle and the pair was ejected from the taxi. Nash was 86 years old."

Calisthenics
"Calisthenics is a series of exercises used to develop strength, power and balance or a repeated rhythmical exercise that uses the weight of the body as resistance or the systematic exercises for attaining strength-gracefulness or the practice of calisthenic exercises."
"The name calisthenics is Greek in origin, a combination of the words 'beauty' and 'strength'."
"Calisthenics is recommended for general good health, light exercises designed to promote general physical fitness."
Muteness
"Muteness means not being able to speak. A person that cannot speak is called a mute. A mute keeps the ability to hear the speech of others. If not, the person would be a deaf mute."
"Muteness is a type of speech disorder. A person who chooses not to speak is said to be ""silent"" rather than mute. Slang for this (British English) is ""keeping mum""."
"Originally, the common word dumb or ""dumbness"" used to mean ""unable to speak"". Unfortunately this was taken over to mean """"unwilling"" to speak"" or ""unintelligent"". So people prefer ""muteness"". ""Dumb"" is a much commoner word, and might be used if it would not be misunderstood."
Cause (eteliology).
"In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: genetics, psychological, or trauma."
"For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder."
"Adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak: this may be due to disease, injury, damage or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur, but rarely, for psychological reasons. Damage (however caused) to the parts of the brain needed for speech is called aphasia."
Action.
"Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. A speech assessment may decide cause and treatment. Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is a permanent condition, a range of communication devices are available to help communication."
Speech-generating devices help people with speech deficiencies.
Wooden spoon
"Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in danger, they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do."
"Grebes can have long or short bills. If they eat insects in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat crustaceans (for example, crabs) they will have a long, sharp bill."
"Most grebes are brown, white and red/orange. They have many, waterproof feathers. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In spring and summer, grebes have orange crests on their heads. This is so they can attract a mate. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they ""dance"" in the water."
Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults.
Habitat.
"Grebes live in freshwater (lakes or rivers). Some species of grebe will go to saltwater (sea/ocean) when they are migrating. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in North America, Europe or Asia. Grebes in South America, Africa and Asia do not migrate. They are found in every continent on earth."
Funeral director
"A Funeral Director also called a mortician or undertaker is a person who has the job of organizing a funeral. This often includes embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the planning and arrangement of the actual funeral ceremony. They place the body into a coffin or casket. If people are going to come and look at the body before burial, the funeral director will have the body dressed, and made up with cosmetics to make it look better."
Mangrove
"Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics. Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat, called a ""mangrove swamp"", ""mangrove forest"", ""mangrove"" or ""mangal"". Mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores. They are also found in sub-tropical Africa, Asia, and the southwest Pacific. Their twisted, tangled roots collect sediment. Over time, the sediment may become islands, or extend the shoreline."
Description.
"Mangroves live right in the sea, or at the sea edge. Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fall. If the water level is high, they may be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As soil and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed – just the right place for other island vegetation to grow. This is an example of seed dispersal by water."
"Mangroves have special root-like structures. They are aerial roots or ""pneumatophores"". These stick up out of the soil, and are covered in lenticels. They take in oxygen through their pores. These ""breathing tubes"" may reach heights of up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. Smaller roots with air passages move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater. For more information please visit a geography site https://www.kidsgeog.com THANK YOU Mangrove"
Benefits.
"Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral reefs which often surround them. They trap dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants. The tree also protects the shoreline (and, through this, the coral reefs) from being eroded by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish, shrimp, and crabs to grow."
BBC account.
"Mangroves are a group of about 80 different salt-tolerant species of trees. They can live along the intertidal zones of tropical and sub-tropical coastlines. Their roots stand the ebb and flow of tides. The roots slow the flow of the tidal waters. This lets sediment settle and build up as nutrient-rich mud. The habitat is a valuable shelter and breeding site for fish. It stabilises coastlines, and reduces erosion from storm surges and tsunamis."
Great crested grebe
"The great crested grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is ""Podiceps cristatus""."
Description.
The great crested grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46–51 cm long. Its wingspan (both wings open) is 59–73 cm long.
"The bird is white, brown and black, and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby great crested grebe have black and white stripes on their heads."
Habitat and behaviour.
"The great crested grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food."
"The bird has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a ""dance"" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking."
"The great crested grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water."
Conservation.
"The bird nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many great crested grebe in the United Kingdom, where their conservation status is ""green"" (""least concern"")."
Bill Hicks
"William 'Bill' Hicks (16 December 1961 - 26 February 1994) was an American stand-up comedian known for his controversial act which made fun of religion and politics amongst other areas. Since then, many other stand-up comedians in the United States and United Kingdom have said they have been very influenced by his work, which is still very popular today."
"Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia and raised in Houston, Texas. He died of pancreatic cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Gene Wilder
"Gene Wilder (Jerome Silberman; June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016) was an American actor, author, comedian, director and screenwriter. He was most famous for his acting work and in particular for the movies he made with Mel Brooks which include ""The Producers"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"". He also played the part of Willy Wonka in the musical movie ""Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory""."
Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa.
"Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956."
"An unauthorized biography of Wilder called ""Gene Wilder: Funny and Sad"" by Brian Scott Mednick was published in December 2010 by BearManor Media."
"Wilder died from Alzheimer's disease on August 29, 2016 in Stamford, Connecticut at age 83."
Exeter City F.C.
Exeter City F.C. is an English association football club currently competing in the English Football League. They were founded in 1904 and currently play at the St James Park ground.
Possibly their most famous game was when they drew 0-0 against Manchester United in an FA Cup match in 2005 at United's home ground of Old Trafford.
Die Lollipops
"Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old."
Music.
Their music can be divided into three basic types:
Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics:
History.
"""Die"" is German for ""the"" (plural); ""Lollipops"" is a loanword from English. The most common German word for lollipop is ""Lutscher"", but Germans now also use ""Lollipop"". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called ""die Lollipops"" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000."
"Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called ""Einfach tierisch"" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called ""Immer in Bewegung"" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus Büchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called ""Wir feiern wieder Feste"" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus &amp; Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus."
"Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com."
Water opossum
"The water opossum (""Chironectes minimus"") is also known as the yapok. It is an aquatic marsupial and a member of the opossum family. It has black and grey waterproof fur and webbed hind feet. It is ""the only living marsupial where both sexes have a backward-pointing pouch""."
"The animal is found in the freshwater streams and lakes in Mexico, Central and South America. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows. It comes out after dusk to search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank."
The yapok's webbed back feet helps it chase its prey in the water.
Blazing Saddles
"Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy western movie directed by Mel Brooks starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and Harvey Korman. It tells the story of a black Sheriff, played by Little, who is appointed Sheriff of a small Western town and how he must try to make friends with the racist towns people and stop a ruthless businessman from knocking down the town to make way for a railway line."
"They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top. They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or ""advocaat"" filling, or with no filling at all. The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried."
Naming.
"The name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany. Most areas in German speaking regions call it a ""Berliner"". Residents of Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony often know them as ""Pfannkuchen"", which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes - pancakes are known there as ""Eierkuchen"" (lit. egg cakes). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of ""Krapfen""; in Hessen they are referred to as ""Kräppel"" or ""Kreppel"", or, in Palatinate, ""Fastnachtsküchelchen"" (literally: ""little carnival cakes"")."
"In South Tirol, part of northern Italy, the food is called ""krafen"" or ""krapfen"". In Slovenia, it is ""krof""; in Croatia ""krafne""; in Bosnia, and Serbia ""krofne"". In Poland they are known as ""pączki"", in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called ""fánk"". All of these are essentially identical preparations. In Spain it is called ""Berlinesa"". In the Netherlands it is called ""Berlinerbol"". IN France it is called ""Boule de Berlin""."
"In English-speaking countries, Berliners are often called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream. However, in South Australia, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglophone North America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is ""jelly doughnut"". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not ""set"" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream."
The cream or custard-filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.
"In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest in the U.S., such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a ""Bismarck,"" while a filled bar doughnut is called a ""Long John"", and usually contains pastry creme, custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include ""jambuster"" in Manitoba, and ""Burlington bun"" in Nova Scotia."
New Year's Eve.
"Berliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (""Silvester"") as well as the carnival holidays (Mardi Gras). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone."
Variations.
"In Portugal, berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as ""bolas de Berlim"" (Berlin ball) and the filling is always an egg-yolk- based yellow cream called ""creme pasteleiro"" (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half- length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle on it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country."
"Such versions are also found in Latin America, in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, where it's not only filled with custard (called ""Crema pastelera""), but with jam (especially red ones) or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called ""sonhos"" (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow cream (called simply ""creme""). Some modern variants filled with ""doce de leite"" (a type of milk jam), or a mix of chocolate and ""doce de leite"", can be found in Rio de Janeiro's bakeries."
"In Israel, a version of the pastry called ""sufganiyah"" is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah. While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam, many modern variants exist."
Campbell University
"Campbell University is a private, coeducational baptist university in Buies Creek, North Carolina. The university has about 10,471 students. It was founded in 1887. The current president of the university is Jerry M. Wallace."
Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university are called the Fighting Camels. They have 18 varsity teams which mostly compete in the Big South Conference. Despite the Big South sponsoring football, the Campbell football team plays in the Pioneer Football League (PFL). That league is made up of schools that choose not to offer scholarships for football, despite offering them in other sports."
Belmont University
"Belmont University is a private, coeducational university in Nashville, Tennessee. The university has about 5,936 students. It was founded in 1890. The current president of the university is Robert Fisher."
Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university, called the Bruins, mostly play in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The men's tennis team plays in the Horizon League because the MVC sponsors tennis only for women."
Florida Gulf Coast University
"Florida Gulf Coast University is a public, coeducational university in Fort Myers, Florida. The university has about 12,024 students. It was founded in 1991. The current president of the university is Wilson G. Bradshaw."
Sports.

Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
"The Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum (Vietnamese: Lăng Hồ Chí Minh) is a large memorial to Vietnamese independence leader Hồ Chí Minh. It is located in Ba Ðình Square in Hà Nội. This is where his body is kept for people to pay their respects. President Hồ Chí Minh did not want a mausoleum at all. In his will, he said he wanted to be cremated and to have his ashes buried in the hills of the north, center, and south of Việt Nam. He said that he liked cremation because it was healthier than burial or a mausoleum and saved farmland. His successors did not let him have this wish. The government kept that part of his will secret. The government also pretended he died a day after he really did, because he really died on Independence Day and they did not tell anyone."
"Many aspects of ""Uncle Ho's"" last will and testament were altered or, as stated above, ignored. In his last days he was surrounded by those who formed what is now Vietnam's political system, while those loyal to him and his wishes were systematically kept or chased away. Others were put on a bus and executed."
Meng Tian
"Meng Tian (; ? - 210 BC ) was a Chinese general of the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. His grandfather, Meng Ao, and his father, Meng Wu, were generals as well. After the unification of China, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered Meng Tian leading 300,000 armies to attack the Xiongnu and build the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian was forced by the eunuch, Zhao Gao, to kill himself by drinking poisonous wine after the death of Emperor Qin Shi Haung."
Kippah
A kippah (Hebrew) or yarmulke (Yiddish) is a small cloth cap worn by Jews.
"Traditionally it was worn only by men, but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of Judaism has led some women to wear yarmulkes. Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while praying; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering (especially outside)."
The basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the Talmud (tractate Shabbat).
"Often, the color and fabric of the ""yarmulke"" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. The Israeli National Religious community is often referred to by the name ""kipot srugot"" כיפות סרוגות, literally ""woven yarmulkes"". Similarly, some Haredi sects are referred to by the name ""kipot shkhorot"" כיפות שחורות, literally ""black yarmulkes""."
Etymology.
"The etymology of ""yarmulke"" is unclear. Linguists (e.g. Max Vasmer) maintain that the Yiddish word is derived (via Russian or Polish) from the Turkic """", meaning 'raincoat'."
"Traditionally, ""yarmulke"" is considered to have originated from the Aramaic phrase """""" (in awe of the Lord), in keeping with the principle that the yarmulke is supposed to reflect someone's fear of heaven. Or perhaps, ""yira malkah"""" (fear of the King)."
Judeo-Arabic dialects
"Judeo-Arabic languages are a collection of Arabic language dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking countries. Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Judæo-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet."
"In retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language."
"In the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script)."
This phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).
"Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary. Only later were they translated into medieval scientific Hebrew so that they could be read by the Ashkenazic Jews of Europe. These include:"
The Clangers
"The Clangers is a British children's television series. The first episode was broadcast on the BBC on 16 November 1969. The series is about a family of aliens who live under the surface of the Moon in caves. They looked like small, pink, knitted mice. Other characters include the Froglets and The Soup Dragon, a dragon that gives out soup. The family uses a US flag as a table cloth."
London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
"The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is a London borough in West London but is part of an area called Inner London. House prices are more expensive than most parts of England. The borough has three famous football teams: Fulham F.C., Queens Park Rangers F.C. and Chelsea F.C."
1 E9 m²
"1 E9 m² is a term used to group together areas of similar size. It is used for places that are between 1,000 km² and 10,000 km² in area. The term is based from the scientific notation for 1 x 109m²."
Garry Kasparov
"Garry Kasparov (born 13 April 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian chess grandmaster and political activist. He was born with the name ""Garry Weinstein"", and is partly of Jewish descent. He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation (the PCA), because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and was the highest-rated player even after his retirement, It was till much later when Magnus Carlsen took him over."
"Kasparov became the youngest non-disputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when an argument with FIDE led him to set up a rival company, the Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kasparov lost a match (a series of chess games) against ""Deep Blue"", a computer made by IBM, in 1997. Lately, retired from competition, he has been coaching Magnus Carlsen, the young player from Norway who is the current world #1."
Politics.
"After retiring from chess, Kasparov became involved in Russian politics. In 2005, he traveled around Russia, speaking against Vladimir Putin, who was President of Russia at that time. The same year he created the United Civil Front, a political movement whose main goal is to dismantle Putin's regime and restore democracy in Russia."
"Kasparov was also one of the founders of The Other Russia, an opposition coalition which unites many left and nationalist politicians. He helped organize marches of dissenters involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and governors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg."
"In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency. In November 2007, he was detained by police at a rally in Moscow and given a jail sentence of five days. On 12 December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a hall where at least 500 of his supporters could meet to endorse his candidacy, as is legally required. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to discourage anyone from renting a hall for the gathering. In 2008 Kasparov and his United Civil Front joined the Solidarity movement."
Kasparov is among the 34 first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti-Putin campaign Putin must go started in March 2010.
Stanley Vann
"Stanley Vann (born Leicester, 15 February 1910 - 27 March 2010) was an English composer, organist, choral conductor, and choir trainer. He contributed a great deal to music in the Anglican church tradition. He was Director of Music at Peterborough Cathedral from 1953 to 1977. On 15 February 2010 he celebrated his 100th birthday. He died the following month."
Early life.
"Vann was born in Leicester. He started to learn the piano when he was about six years old. At the age of 17 he learned the organ, and by the time he was 20 he had passed his ARCM, ARCO and FRCO organ diplomas."
The start of a musical career.
"In 1931 he became Assistant Organist at Leicester Cathedral. In 1933 he became Organist at Gainsborough Parish Church, then went to Leamington Spa as Organist of Holy Trinity church in 1939. He started a choir and an orchestra there: the Leamington Spa Bach Choir and the Warwickshire Symphony Orchestra."
Between 1942 and 1946 he had to fight in the Second World War.
"In 1949 he got the jobs of Organist at Chelmsford Cathedral and Professor of Harmony and Counterpoint at Trinity College, London. In Chelmsford he started the Essex Symphony Orchestra."
He also trained the Leicester Philharmonic choir for the famous conductors Henry Wood and Malcolm Sargent.
Peterborough.
"In 1909 Vann became Master of the Music in Peterborough Cathedral. He stayed in this job until he retired in 1977. The choir was not particularly good when he started there, but he soon made them into an excellent choir. They made many recordings. In 1971 he was given a Lambeth doctorate by the Archbishop of Canterbury for his services to music."
"When he retired he first moved to Wansford in Cambridgeshire so that he was half way between his son (in Yorkshire) and his daughter (in Berkshire). He continued to work there, training the church choir, giving singing lessons, and composing. Later he moved to Yorkshire to be nearer to family. He died aged 100 after falling down and breaking his hip."
Compositions.
"Stanley Vann composed a great deal of music, mostly for the Anglican church service. His compositions include hymn tunes, anthems, motets, chants, organ music and many other pieces. One of his largest pieces is the Billingshurst Mass, for large chorus and orchestra. It was first performed in Chichester Cathedral in 2000."
"In 2000 a concert was given in All Saints Church, Peterborough to celebrate his 90th birthday. On Sunday 14 February 2010 many cathedrals and churches in England arranged special concerts and services to celebrate his 100th birthday"
". The BBC broadcast a special choral evensong on Radio 3 on Wednesday 24 February from Peterborough Cathedral (Wednesday 17 February is Ash Wednesday, so that a lot of his music would not have been suitable.)."
There is a scholarship in his name for young choir trainers and directors in the Anglican tradition.
Royal College of Organists
"The Royal College of Organists or RCO, is an organisation based in the United Kingdom, but with members around the world. Its job is to support organ playing and choral music. People who learn the organ can go there to take professional organ examinations."
"There is a large library with more than 60,000 books about organ playing and organ music."
"When the RCO started in 1864 by Richard Limpus it was called the ""College of Organists"". It was given a Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered an extremely cheap 99-year lease on a beautiful building in Kensington, West London. The college was there until 1991 when it moved to a church in the City of London. In 2003 it moved again to Birmingham."
"The holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound. Whisper keys were also invented to prevent overblowing. The bassoon is known for its reedy sound. Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary. Middle register could be used for lullabies because of its majestic and soothing tone. Its lower register is deep, dark, and could be used for scary movies and such."
History and repertoire.
"The bassoon developed from a renaissance instrument called the ""curtal"" or ""dulcian"". These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms. In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line, perhaps playing the same as the cello. A man named Hotteterre made many parts of the modern bassoon. In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra. Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart, and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies. The bassoon was a very important instrument in the orchestra. Mozart and Beethoven gave the bassoon important parts in the music."
Contrabassoon.
"In some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used. This plays an octave lower than a bassoon, taking it right down to bottom B flat or C on the piano. Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower, i.e. the very lowest note of the piano (A). One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra, but in fact the tube keeps doing U-turns, making four parallel rows of tubing. They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards. The weight is supported by a peg to the floor. The contrabassoon used to be shaped like a bassoon."
"The contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra. Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn-like introduction to the last movement of ""Symphony no 1"" by Brahms. It can be clearly heard, growling away, in the opening of the ""Piano Concerto for the Left Hand"" by Ravel."
Octave
An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.
If a musician sings or plays a scale (‘do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do’) the first and last ‘do’ are an octave apart. It is called an ‘octave’ because there are eight notes in a scale (‘octo’ is Latin for ‘eight’).
If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “Somewhere over the rainbow” (i.e. the word ‘Somewhere’) these two notes are an octave apart.
"Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar, almost like the same note. The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast. For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second. The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second."
"Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger)."
Tinder
Tinder is a material that is used to start fires easily when lit with a match.
Some materials commonly used as tinder are:
Stephen Harper
"Stephen Joseph Harper (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian economist, entrepreneur, and retired politician. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015. He is a member and the former leader of the Conservative Party, after being elected in 2004. He was elected in February 2006 and replaced Paul Martin as Prime Minister."
"Harper was born in 1959 in Toronto, Ontario and lives in Calgary, Alberta. He is married to Laureen Teskey and has two children. He is the third Prime Minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, to send their children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. Stephen Harper was Prime Minister for nine years, during which Canada hosted both the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games. Harper also hosted the G8 and G20 meetings."
"Harper is a conservative and supports cutting government spending and taxes. As Prime Minister, he has cut the goods and services tax and approved a budget that would cut funding to several government programs. He has also shown support for the military and a bigger Canadian military presence in the northern part of Canada."
"Even though Harper did win the seat in the riding of Calgary Heritage during the October 19, 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party was defeated by the Liberal Party of Canada, which was led by Justin Trudeau and who succeeded Harper as Prime Minister. It was thereafter announced Harper would resign as party leader and had requested an interim leader be chosen to serve until a leadership election can be held."
Tadpole
A tadpole or polliwog is the larva of a frog. It breathes water and lives in the water. Tadpoles hatch from small eggs.
"Frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. Like bird eggs, they have nutrients (food) inside them for the young animal to grow before it hatches."
Movement.
"Tadpoles swim by lateral undulation: their tails move side to side, not up and down."
Food.
"Most types of tadpole eat only plants, for example algae on rocks. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles."
Metamorphosis.
"AJ Lee held the Divas Championship 3 times in the WWE, successfully retaining her title at WrestleMania XXX. the night after on 'Raw' she was defeated and lost her title to NXT Woman's Champion, Paige. On the June 30, 2014 episode of ""Raw"", Lee returned to the WWE. She challenged Paige for the Divas Championship and won her second championship."
"On April 3, 2015, it was announced that AJ decided to retire from the company."
Basset Hound
"The Basset Hound is a short-legged dog, of the hound family. Bassets are used in hunting to detect the scent of game. Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound."
"The name ""Basset"" comes from French words meaning ""rather low""."
"Basset Hounds usually have coats of brown, black or white and are most often spotted. Sometimes they can be other colors. Basset Hounds have been bred from the nineteenth century. They are said to descend from the Basset d'Artois. Basset Hounds are tall, and can weight up to ."
Alvin Plantinga
"Alvin Plantinga (born November 15, 1932, Ann Arbor, Michigan ) is an American epistemologist, philosopher of religion and professor at the University of Notre Dame. He is a founding member of the Society of Christian Philosophers."
Plantinga's aim in philosophy is to defend believing in God as rational. His epistemology is one that tries to say that knowledge is only possible if you accept the possibility of some form of intelligent design by God.
Acute radiation syndrome
"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period. It is mainly damage to the blood, digestive system, and nervous system."
Castorocauda
"Castorocauda was a genus of small, semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the Jurassic period, about 154 million years ago."
"Its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia. ""Castorocauda"" was highly specialized, with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers, otters, and the platypus (convergent evolution). It is the earliest animal found with fur."
"""Castorocauda"" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta."
"Although ""Castorocauda"" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a ""small nocturnal insectivore""."
Element Skateboards
"Element Skateboards (sometimes shortened to Element) is an American company. It is known for making skateboards and swimwear. It was founded in 1992 by Johnny Schillereff. The company is based out of Irvine, California. The company was originally known as Underworld Element Skateboards but Schillereff decided to drop the ""Underworld"" part due to the company being absorbed because of financial problems. The Element company also sponsors professional skateboarders like Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Chad Muska, Ray Barbee, Vanessa Torres, Mark Appleyard, Nyjah Huston and"

Gustave Doré
"Paul Gustave Doré (; January 6, 1832 – January 23, 1883) was a French artist, engraver, illustrator and sculptor. Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving."
Biography.
"Doré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante."
"In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's ""Don Quixote"". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883."
"Doré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from ""The Microcosm of London"" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project."
"The completed book, ""London: A Pilgrimage,"" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London."
Economic growth.
Coffee was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century. It was first shipped to Europe in 1843. It became Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee would remain Costa Rica's biggest export until the 20th century.
"Most of the coffee exported was transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government asked U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Limón. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890."
"Most Afro-Costa Ricans come from Jamaican immigrants who worked on the railway. United States convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also worked in the construction of the railroad."
"In exchange for making the railroad, Costa Rican gave Keith large amounts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas became the largest export. The United Fruit Company began to hold a major role in the national economy."
20th century.
Costa Rica has enjoyed greater peace and political stability than other Latin American nations.
"But in 1917–19, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown. The unpopularity of Tinoco's government led to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military."
"In 1948, José Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising between the previous president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia (he served as president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco. With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century."
"The victorious rebels formed a government that abolished the military. It oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After that, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2014. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent."
Geography.
"Costa Rica is on the Central American isthmus. It is between latitudes 8° and 12°N, and longitudes 82° and 86°W. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It has a total of of coastline. Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north ( of border) and Panama to the southeast ( of border). In total, Costa Rica has plus of territorial waters."
"The highest point in the country is Cerro Chirripó, at . The largest lake in Costa Rica is Lake Arenal."
Climate.
"Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator. The climate is tropical all year. The country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, and the geography of each region."
"Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls. It does not have the four seasons other countries have. The year can be split into two seasons: the dry season (known as summer), and the rainy season (known as winter). The ""summer"" starts in December and ends in April. ""Winter"" starts in May and ends in November. During this time it rains constantly in some regions."
"The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean. Annual rainfall is over . Humidity is also higher here. The mean annual temperature on the coast is around . in the main populated areas, and below on the highest mountains."
"There are many national parks in Costa Rica, including Manuel Antonio National Park."
Plants and animals.
"Costa Rica is home to many plants and animals. The country has only about 0.25% of the world's landmass, but it has 5% of the world's biodiversity. Almost 25% of Costa Rica's land area is in national parks and protected areas. This is the largest percentage of protected areas in the world."
Costa Rica successfully reduced deforestation. It had one of the worst deforestation rates in the world from 1973 to 1989. But it was almost zero by 2005.
"The Corcovado National Park is internationally known by ecologists for its biodiversity. Visitors can see many different types of animals. An example is the big cats and tapirs. Corcovado is the only park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkeys can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler,the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey and the Central American squirrel monkey. The squirrel monkey is found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama."
"Tortuguero National Park is home to spider, howler, and white-throat Capuchin monkeys. It is also the home of three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth. It has 320 species of birds and many reptiles. There is an annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest here."
"The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is home to almost 2,000 plant species. Including many orchids. It is also home to more than 400 types of birds. There are more than 100 species of mammals here."
"Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians. They have the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (""Ctenosaura similis"")."
"Provinces, cantons, and districts."
"Article 168 of the Constitution of Costa Rica says the political divisions are classified into 3 groups: provinces, cantons, and districts."
Costa Rica has seven provinces. The provinces are divided into 81 cantons. The canton is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by the canton's people. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 463 districts.
The provinces are:
Sports.
Costa Rica entered the Summer Olympics for the first time in 1936 with the fencer Bernardo de la Guardia. They entered the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1980 with the skier Arturo Kinch. All four of Costa Rica's Olympic medals were won by the sisters Silvia and Claudia Poll in swimming. Claudia won the country's only gold medal in 1996.
Association football is the most popular sport in Costa Rica. The national team has played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments. They reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 2014. Its best performance in the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup was runner-up in 2002.
"Under Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice President, the President nominates someone to replace the Vice President. If a majority of both Houses of Congress agree, that person becomes the Vice President."
Section 3: Presidential declaration.
"Section 3 says that a President can declare themselves ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of their office"" (unable to do their job). He or she must say this in a written letter to both the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Once the President does this, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The President can take back the Presidency at any time by sending letters to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House, saying he or she is able to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency again."
Section 4 is the only part of the Amendment that has never been used. It allows other executive officials to declare the President unable to do his job. The Vice President must agree to do this. So must:
"To declare the President unable to do his job, these people would have to sign and give a letter to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. As with Section 3, the Vice President would then become the Acting President."
"The President may take back the Presidency by sending a letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet think the President is still disabled and still cannot do his job, they can challenge his return. They have four days to write another declaration saying the President is still unable to do his job. The Vice President is still Acting President during these four days. Congress then has to get together within 48 hours, if they are not already in session. Then Congress has 21 days to make a decision. In the meantime, the Vice President is still Acting President."
"If two-thirds of each House of Congress votes that the President still cannot do his job, the Vice President would continue to be Acting President. If Congress does not vote this way, or if they do not vote at all within 21 days, the President takes over the Presidency again."
Uses.
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked (used) six times since it was added to the Constitution. Section 1 has been used once; Section 2 has been used twice; and Section 3 has been used three times. Only Section 4 has never been used, though it was considered twice."
Use of Section 1.
"President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, before the House could vote on whether to impeach him for crimes related to the Watergate scandal. Vice President Gerald Ford became President as soon as Nixon resigned."
Use of Section 2.
"On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Two days later, President Richard Nixon nominated United States Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan to be the new Vice President. According to Section 2, more than 50% of each House of Congress had to approve Ford as Vice President. By December 6, 97% of the Senate and 92% of the House had approved Ford. Ford was sworn in to the Vice Presidency later on December 6 before both Houses of Congress. Ford is the only person in United States history ever to be Vice President, and later President, without being elected to either office."
"When Gerald Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned, the Vice Presidency became vacant. On August 20, 1974, the new President Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be the new Vice President. On December 10, 1974, the Senate confirmed Rockefeller with a vote of 90–7. Nine days later, the House voted 287-128 to confirm Rockefeller. He was sworn into office later on December 19, 1974, before the Senate."
Use of Section 3.
"Presidents have used Section 3 of the 25th Amendment three times. Each time, they have given power to their Vice Presidents for a short time because they needed to get anesthesia for medical tests or surgery. The three Acting Presidents in United States history are listed below."
George H. W. Bush (1985).
"On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan found out that he had a small growth in his colon that could turn into colon cancer. His doctor told him he needed surgery. Reagan decided to have surgery right away."
"However, Reagan did not want to invoke Section 3 of the 25th Amendment. He was worried that giving Presidential power away would set a bad precedent. The White House's head lawyer and Reagan's Chief of Staff suggested that he use Section 3 and give power to Vice President George H.W. Bush."
"Two letters were created. The first invoked Section 3 and said Reagan would be unable to discharge his duties. The second said that Reagan knew about Section 3, and did not think it applied to his situation, but still wanted Bush to take over during his surgery. On July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and had it delivered to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House."
"Reagan's autobiography, and other books, argue that Reagan clearly meant to give power to Vice President Bush.pp. 197–200 The White House lawyer, Fred Fielding, said:"
"However, since Reagan did not specifically mention Section 3 and say he could not do his job as President, he did not officially invoke the 25th Amendment."
Dick Cheney (2002; 2007).
"On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush became the first President to officially invoke Section 3. He needed a colonoscopy, a test of the colon, and would be getting anesthesia. He formally gave power to his Vice President, Dick Cheney, using the rules that the 25th Amendment set out. Unlike Reagan, he specifically said he was using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment in his letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. After about two hours, Bush was awake and took back the Presidency."
"On July 21, 2007, President Bush again invoked Section 3 so he could have another colonoscopy. Again, Cheney was Acting President for about two hours, until Bush was ready to take back the Presidency."
Considered use of Section 4.
"As of 2021, Section 4 has never been invoked, however there were at least two occasions where the use of Section 4 was considered and another where its non-use came under substantial criticism. These occurred during the presidency of Ronald Reagan."
1981: Reagan assassination attempt.
"On March 30, 1981, a man named John Hinckley tried to kill President Ronald Reagan. Reagan was shot and needed immediate surgery, so he could not invoke Section 3 to give power to his Vice President. His Vice President, George H.W. Bush, did not invoke Section 4, because he was on an airplane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush got to Washington, D.C.pp. 195–6, 253-5"
"In 1995, Birch Bayh, who had written the Senate version of the 25th Amendment, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked."
1987: Reagan accused of not doing his job.
"In 1987, Reagan's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, resigned.p. 218 Howard Baker replaced him.p. 83 Reagan's staff told Baker that Reagan seemed lazy and unable to do his job. They told him to be ready for Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to be invoked."
"John ""Johnny Appleseed"" Chapman (September 26, 1774 - March 11, 1847) is an American folk hero. He was a Christian missionary and pioneer. His nickname came from the fact that he planted apple trees throughout the American Midwest. Many people consider him an early conservationist or ""tree-hugger"". He wandered the country, usually barefoot, and with a cooking pot on his head for most of his adult life, planting apple trees, teaching the Bible, telling stories, and befriending Native Americans, wild animals, and other settlers. Many stories have been told about him and his journeys, as well as art, books, and later movies, which makes him a folk hero. He was born in Leominster, Massachusetts and is buried in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne, Indiana."
Facts.
"John Chapman is said to have been in the Wilkes-Barre region some time in the 1790s, practicing his profession as a nurseryman, but just when he embraced the Swedenborgian faith and began his missionary activities we cannot be sure, though it is probable that it was before he ever reached western Pennsylvania. There are some early accounts of John speaking of his own activities as ""a Bible missionary"" on the Potomac when he was a young man, and Johnny was seen for two or three consecutive years along the banks of the Potomac in eastern Virginia, picking the seeds from the pomace of the cider mills in the late 1790s.The apple seeds that Johnny obtained were free, as the cider mills wanted there to be more apple trees planted to improve their business."
"At the time of his death, Johnny Appleseed left an estate of more than 1,200 acres of nurseries, and he left these to his sister. He additionally had four plots located in Allen County, Indiana, which was a nursery that included 15,000 trees."
"Records show that John Chapman appeared on Licking Creek, in what is now Licking County, Ohio, in 1800, when he was twenty-six years old. He had probably come up the Muskingum River to plant near the Refugee Tract, which would soon fill up with settlers, when Congress actually got around to granting the lands. In April, 1798, the Continental Congress had ratified resolutions to donate public lands for the benefit of those who had left Canada and Nova Scotia to fight against the British in the Revolutionary War. The lands were actually set apart in 1801 and patents issued in 1802. Grants of land ranging from 160 acres to 2,240 acres were awarded according to the exertions of the patentee in the War. Johnny, with true Yankee enterprise, went ahead and planted his nurseries before the refugees arrived. Licking County, then a part of Fairfield, contained only three white families. By the time families were ready to settle the area, Johnny's tracts of land were ready for market."
Compact disc
"A Compact Disc, also called a CD is a storage device that are small plastic discs which store and retrieve computer data or music using light. Compact Discs replaced floppy disks because they were faster and could hold more information. The CDs made floppy disks become obsolete. CDs were invented by both Philips and Sony at the same time, but not together. Sony and Philips did work together to create a standard format and the technology to read CDs in 1982. CDs can hold up to 700 MB worth of data, which is about 80 minutes of music. Mini CDs were also made for special small programs like drivers. CDs that have computer information on them are called CD-ROMs, or Compact Disc - Read Only Memory. The diameter of a normal CD is 120 mm. The middle hole in a CD is about 1.5 cm)."
Maidstone
"Maidstone is a town in Kent, in England. It stands on the River Medway. Maidstone is the county town of Kent, meaning the local government is based there. Its name means ""stone of the maidens"". The town of Maidstone is within the borough of Maidstone, which also includes several surrounding villages. In 2001, 75,070 people lived in the town of Maidstone, and there were 138,959 in the whole of the Borough."
History.
"During the Civil War a battle took place in 1648, which was won by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers. A year later, Andrew Broughton, who was then Mayor of Maidstone (and also Clerk to the High Court of Justice) gave the death sentence to Charles I. Today there is a plaque in Maidstone Town Centre describing Andrew as 'Mayor and Regicide' (a killer of kings)."
"Maidstone used to be an industrial area, with paper making and brewing being two of the most important industries, although both have mainly died out in recent years. Until 1998, Sharps Toffee factory was where Bassets liquorice allsorts and other sweets were made. Most of the heavy industry has now been replaced by light and service industries."
Today.
"Today, Maidstone is one of the top five shopping centres in the south east of England, with more than one million square feet of retail space. Most of this is in two shopping areas, ""Fremlin Walk"", which was built on the site of one of the old breweries, is , and ""The Mall Maidstone"" provides another . Both include multi-story car parks."
Redhill
Redhill can mean several things:
C. S. Lewis
"Clive Staples Lewis (29 November 1898 – 22 November 1963), usually called C. S. Lewis, was a British scholar who wrote about 40 books. He was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He is famous for his fantasy works, essays, and writings on literature and theology. Lewis' theological works are usually apologetics, the defence of Christianity. Some of his most popular Christian writings were ""Mere Christianity"" and ""The Screwtape Letters"". His works have been translated into more than 30 languages. Lewis was a professor of literature at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge."
Lewis was married to American writer Joy Davidman (1915–1960) from 1956 until her death from bone cancer. He died of renal failure in Oxford.
"His writing is popular with many people, and many of his books were made into movies. His most famous and popular fantasy work is ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", which is a series of seven books."
"He died in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England."
The Corrs
The Corrs is a folk pop rock band from Ireland. There are three sisters and one brother in the quartet. They became very popular in the late 1990s.
The group.
"They were all born in Dundalk, Republic of Ireland, the children of Gerry and Jean Corr."
Jim Corr.
"Jim Corr (born 31 July 1964) is the oldest member of the group. He mainly plays the guitar, but he can also play the on the keyboards and the piano."
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between countries mostly means the rights a Sovereign state has over its territory."
Sometimes there is discussion about when a government loses Sovereignty because it is doing bad things for its people. In this case justice may mean other countries need to intrude on the sovereignty of the government.
Inside a Country.
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between groups inside one country usually means which group has the Legitimacy to rule. This may not be certain. Sometimes the group who is most able to rule (because of a strong military) is not Legitimate."
FIFA
"The (FIFA ; French for ""International Federation of Association Football"") is the organization that controls international football (also called ""association football""). The organization’s main buildings are in Zürich, Switzerland. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930. FIFA was established on May 21, 1905 in Paris and has 209 national associations as its members. The organization’s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish."
"The president of FIFA is currently Gianni Infantino, serving since 26 February 2016."
"The most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws."
"The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's executive committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The executive committee, with the President as its head, is responsible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments."
"Also, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the seven different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Européenne de Football Association in Europe)."
American Idol
"American Idol is an American reality-singing competition series created by Simon Fuller, produced by 19 Entertainment, and distributed by FremantleMedia North America. It aired on Fox from June 11, 2002 to April 7, 2016, as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. On March 11, 2018, the 16th season aired on ABC."
"Eventually the American people are allowed to vote by calling or texting, and the person with the fewest votes is off the show."
The TV show consists of multiple rounds of elimination. The singers can be anyone between the age of 15 and 29 years.
Host and judges.
"""American Idol"" has three judges, who give comments on performances."
The three judges are:

Smile
"A smile is a face made by flexing the muscles near both ends of the mouth. The smile can also be made through the eyes (See 'Duchenne smile' below). Smiles usually express happiness. A smile can be natural or fake. However, smiling can be different with animals. When smiling, the teeth shows, but sometimes animals do this when they are threatening. When chimpanzees show their teeth, it can also be a sign of fear."
Dimples.
"Dimples are genetically inherited. They are caused by the flesh underneath the skin, that forms on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Some people may only have one dimple on only one side of the face."
Duchenne smile.
"Although there are many different types of smiles, researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes. The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician Guillaume Duchenne. Duchenne identified two types of smiles. A Duchenne smile is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes. Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile."
Internet.
"On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is."

"Columbine, Colorado"
"Columbine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Arapahoe and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Colorado. Located mostly in Jefferson County, it lies west of the Denver suburb of Littleton. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 24,280."
"In 1999, Columbine was the site of the Columbine High School massacre."
"Lakewood, Colorado"
"Lakewood is a city in Colorado, the United States. It was founded in 1889."
Its population ranks fifth of all the Colorado cities. It ranks 172nd (in population) out of all the cities in the United States.
"In 2010, the population was 142,980."
"According to the United States Census in 2010, the city population was 142,980. Lakewood is to the west of Denver, Colorado's capital. It is one of the key cities of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor."
History.
"This urban and suburban community was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and W.A.H. Loveland; who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland used to be the president of the Colorado Central Railroad and lived in Golden. After retiring, he moved to the new area known as Lakewood."
"Up until 1969, this area known as Lakewood didn't have a city government. Instead, they relied on water districts, fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. This area known as Lakewood was more of a community and had been around for 80 years. Police protection was provided to them by the Jefferson County Sheriff and volunteers from fire districts."
"In 1969, the City of Lakewood was legally turned into Jefferson City. Not too long after, they held an election. They decided to change the city's name to Lakewood because the majority disliked ""Jefferson City,"" and believes it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At this time, the population was already over 90,000."
"Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route that joined Denver with the Rocky Mountains. Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. Originally, in Lakewood, there was only the Jewish Conspumtive Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, a small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange. However, by the 1950s, grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots could be found as well. Several shopping centers with multiple businesses also developed."
"In 2011, Lakewood was named an All-America City for the first time."
Geography.
"Lakewood is located at at an elevation of . It is located in the middle of U.S. Route 6 and Colorado State Highway 121 in central Colorado,positioned immediately west of Denver and north-northwest of Colorado Springs."
"Lakewood lies in the Colorado Piedmont on the western edge of the Great Plains, just east of the Front Range of the southern Rocky Mountains. Green Mountain, a mesa tall, is located in the far west-central part of the city."
"Lakewood is located in the watershed of the South Platte River. Several small tributaries of the river flow east through it. From north to south, this includes Lakewood Gulch, Weir Gulch, Sanderson Gulch, and Bear Creek. Two tributaries of Lakewood Gulch, Dry Gulch and McIntyre Gulch, flow east through the northern part of the city. Turkey Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, flows northeast through the far southwestern part of the city. In addition, Lena Gulch, a tributary of Clear Creek to the north, flows east then north through the extreme northwestern part of the city."
"Several small lakes and reservoirs are in Lakewood. The Soda Lakes lie in the far southwestern part of the city. East of them lies Bear Creek Lake, a reservoir fed by Bear Creek and Turkey Creek. Clustered near each other in central Lakewood are Main Reservoir, East Reservoir, Smith Reservoir, Kendrick Lake, and Cottonwood Lake. Northeast of them lies Kountze Lake. In the northwestern part of the city, Lena Gulch both feeds and drains Maple Grove Reservoir. In the far southern part of the city lies Bowles Reservoir No. 1 and, just outside the city limits to the reservoir's northeast, Marston Lake."
"According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Of which are land and (2.7%) are covered by water."
"As a suburb of Denver, Lakewood is part of both the greater Denver metropolitan area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. It borders other communities on all sides, including Wheat Ridge to the north, Edgewater to the northeast, Denver to the east and southeast, Dakota Ridge to the south, Morrison to the southwest, and Golden, West Pleasant View, East Pleasant View, and Applewood to the northwest."
Climate.
"Lakewood experiences a semiarid climate (Köppen ""BSk"") with winters tha fluctuate between mild to cold and snowy while summers are warm to hot, with great temperature differences (about 30°F) between day and night year round. Precipitation happens mostly in the spring and summer."

Sochi
"Sochi (Russuan:Со́чи) is a city in Russia on the Black Sea coast. It is in the Russian federal subject of Krasnodar Krai. The 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were played there. The Sochi Olympic Stadium will also be used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches. Sochi is also a popular health resort. It is one of very few places in Russia with a humid subtropical climate (""Cfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
Catherine II of Russia
"Catherine II of Russia (also titled Catherine the Great or Yekaterina Aleksei'evna) (April 21, 1729, Stettin, Germany – November 17, 1796 Tsarskoye Selo, Russia) was Empress of Russia. She came to power by a coup d'état that deposed her husband, who was killed."
"Catherine greatly increased the power of the crown. In wars against the Ottoman Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth she conquered much land in the west and south. During Catherine's rule, Russia became a strong power in Europe."
Early life.
"Catherine was born in Stettin, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time. She was the daughter of Prince Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Johanna Elizabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. She had five brothers and sisters. She married her cousin Peter III (who, like Catherine, was German) at age fifteen, and became empress of Russia at age 32. She was educated in three languages (Russian, German and French). She grew up as a Lutheran (Protestant). When she married Peter, she changed to the Russian Orthodox church."
Marriage.
"Catherine's marriage was said to be unfaithful and distraught. Peter and Catherine were each said to have several lovers. After they had been married nine years, Catherine bore a son, Paul. Paul was born on . Both parents accepted him as legitimate, even though there had been rumors about Catherine having been unfaithful. Catherine also had a daughter Anna, born in 1757. Anna died in 1759. Catherine and Peter had a very difficult relationship. When Peter died, Catherine was left to rule Russia on her own. Catherine had many lovers, probably because of the difficult marriage; over twenty lovers are known. A few of these seem to be more important:"
Reign.
"Six months after Peter took the throne, Catherine led a palace coup to overthrow him. The question of who killed him and why is still much discussed. Catherine was greatly admired by the public. She was much involved in foreign affairs, including successful Russo-Turkish Wars which conquered new territories for Russia."
Death.
"Catherine suffered a stroke on 1. Due to the stroke, she lost consciousness. She died in her bed at 9:20 the following evening, while she was still unconscious. Catherine was buried at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg."
Hiccups
"A hiccup (also spelled hiccough) is sudden tightening of the diaphragm, which is a muscle inside the chest and below the lungs that causes air to be pulled in. A short time after diaphragm contracts, the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in, and results in the ""hic"" sound that gives ""hiccups"" its name. A hiccup is a reflex, a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute, and end on their own after a few minutes."
"Sometimes a single hiccup happens, or they may happen over and over, a few times each minute, in a series called a ""bout"" of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic: the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesn't change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself, without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies (cures) are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last, because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm."
"Hiccups may be triggered (started) by several common human conditions such as swallowing air, eating very quickly, and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases."
The reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory (idea) is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly.
Napoleonic era
"The Napoléonic era was a time in the history of France and Europe. This era existed during the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution. It is the time when Napoleon ruled France. The Napoleonic era begins when Napoléon Bonaparte began to rule by overthrowing the government of France which was then called the Directory, creating the French Consulate. The era ends with Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (November 9, 1799 - June 28, 1815). Afterwards, the Congress of Vienna tried to bring Europe back to pre-French Revolution days."
It was a time of many wars in Europe.
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav state that existed from the second half of World War II (1943) until it was formally dissolved in 1992 (""de facto"" dissolved in 1991 with no leaders representing it) amid the Yugoslav wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia."
"Josip Broz Tito ruled Yugoslavia until 1980 when he died. In June 1991 Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. By 1992, only two states still wanted a union, Serbia and Montenegro. They formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was not recognized as the successor of the SFRY by international leaders."

and we get:
"This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95, we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter ""μ"" between the stochastic endpoints"
and
"This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases, ""μ"" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases, it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:"
"As the desired value 250 of ""μ"" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated."
"The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We ""cannot"" say: ""with probability (1 − α), the parameter ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases, μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases, however, it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That is why we say: ""with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."""
"The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability that it contains the parameter is 95%. However, it is also possible that we may have unluckily picked the wrong one as well."
Emperor Richū
"was the 17th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Richū to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Richū""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
Some scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Nihonshoki"" and ""Kojiki"", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku."
"Richū had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Richū's two sons. Few other details have survived."
Two of Richū's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.
Events of Richū's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Richū's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"In his sixth year of his reign, Richū died."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Richū.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Richū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Jacobitism
"Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuart kings back onto the thrones of England, Scotland, and Kingdom of Ireland. The movement took its name from the Latin form ""Jacobus"" of the name of King James II and VII."
"Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband and first cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts lived on the European mainland after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales."
A great number of Catholic people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory.
Tadao Horie
was a Japanese football player. He played for the Japan national team.
Biography.
"Horie was born in Hamamatsu on September 13, 1913. He played for Waseda WMW, which was consisted of players from his alma mater, Waseda University. At that club, he played with many futures Japan national team players, such as Motoo Tatsuhara, Yasuo Suzuki, and others."
"In Russia, which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, composers were not allowed to be experimental. It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect “Socialist realism” (meaning the workers’ struggle against capitalism). The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev (who spent some time in exile) and Shostakovich (who remained in the Soviet Union)."
"The Hungarian composer Béla Bartók developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries. His music is often quite neoclassical, for example the famous ""Concerto for Orchestra""."
Avant garde experiments.
"In the mid-20th century a group of composers known as the “Darmstadt School” (because they often met in Darmstadt) continued to write music which was based on serialism. This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of them, including both Boulez and Stockhausen, also experimented with electronic music. The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music. It means that it expands the limits, or pushes ahead into new ground (literally the “front guard”, a military analogy). Other American composers were experimental, e.g. Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a “prepared piano” (a piano which makes strange sounds because strange objects are put inside it)."
Jazz influence.
"In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers. George Gershwin’s music is halfway between jazz and classical. Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music. In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz, e.g. Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill."
Minimalism.
"Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated. Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varèse, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand. People found it too mathematical and intellectual. They wanted music with feeling and emotion. A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques. It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated."
Other paths based on tradition.
"While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music. The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer (i.e. he took ideas from many different people). Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton, who each developed their own style. In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber, Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness. In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers. Like Kurt Weill, he often wrote music which had a political purpose, but Weill's music is more jazz-inspired."
"Some contemporary composers (alive today) write music which is deeply religious. These include John Tavener and Arvo Pärt. John Rutter and Bob Chilcott, who write music for choirs which sounds fresh and attractive to new audiences. Other composers have found various ways of creating their own style, e.g. the Scottish composers James MacMillan and Judith Weir and the Master of the Queen's Music: Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. In Russia Sofia Gubaidulina and Galina Ustvolskaya are important voices in the search for new music."
Cuxhaven
"Cuxhaven ( , ; ) is an independent town and seat of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is on the shore of the North Sea at the mouth of the Elbe River. Cuxhaven has a footprint of (east–west) by (north–south). Its town quarters Duhnen, Döse and Sahlenburg are popular vacation spots on the North Sea and home to about 52,000 residents."
Geographical and cultural background.
The town is served by Cuxhaven station.
The island of Neuwerk is off the coast from Cuxhaven.
Twin towns – sister cities.
Cuxhaven is twinned with:
Haifa Wehbe
"Haifa Wehbe (, born March 10, 1972) is a female Lebanese singer, actress, model, and jewelry designer who is known in the Arab world. Wehbe was born in a rural town in South Lebanon and currently lives in Beirut. She started her music career with her debut album ""Huwa az-Zaman"" (, ""It is Time"")."
Early life and career.
"Before she became a singer, she was a model. She won title ""Miss South Lebanon"" when she was sixteen. In 1995, she was the runner-up for Miss Lebanon before the public found out she had a daughter named Zeinab."
"Her second 2005 album was ""Baddi 'Ayš"" (, ""I Want to Live""). Her second songs was ""Ana Haifa"" (""I am Haifa"")."
She also appeared in Pepsi ad with French footballer Thierry Henry.
Dynamics (music)
"In music, the dynamics in the piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases."
"In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano”, as a dynamic level, is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”)."
"Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music."
"Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly. Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another."
"Scallops and file clams can swim to escape a predator, clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later."
Defensive secretions.
"The file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ."
Comparison with brachiopods.
"Bivalves are superficially similar to brachiopods, but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, they are on the left and right sides."
"Bivalves appeared late in the Cambrian explosion and came to increase in the Palaeozoic, and dominate over brachiopods during the Mesozoic. So, it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods, and this caused brachiopods to be out-competed and relegated to minor niches."
"However, after the Permian-Triassic extinction event bivalves had a huge adaptive radiation while brachiopods were devastated, losing 95% of their diversity."
The upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable inshore habitats. Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer.

Bishop
Bishop is a type of clergy in some Christian churches. The bishop is the leader of the Christians and the Christian priests in each diocese. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a bishopric. Episcopal is the adjective for bishops. A cathedral is the church building where the bishop has an episcopal throne. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's see. A bishop may be given the rank of archbishop in an archdiocese.
"Christian priests in some denominations must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above parish priests in the hierarchy of the church's organization. However, some Protestant denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example."
"In the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378)."
"The pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'. In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican. All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in some orthodox churches). In the Anglican church, bishops are governed by Archbishops."
"Usually a bishop can be identified by a special hat, called a mitre."
Tray
A tray is a shallow container designed for carrying things.
"Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them. They are often rectangular, and may or may not have handles with which to carry them."
"A butler's tray has a deeper surround, handles on the short sides (usually cut into the surround) so that it can be easily carried, and folding legs. It is used to carry drinks, and can be used as a side table."
Orkney Islands
"The Orkney Islands (often also called only Orkney) is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, United Kingdom. It is about 16 kilometres north of Caithness. 20 of the about 70 islands have people living on them. The administrative centre is Kirkwall (with about 8000 people living there). The next largest settlements are Stromness (2000 people) and St. Margaret's Hope (with about 550 people)."
"In addition to the mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles. All of them are made of sandstone. The climate is mild and the soil is fertile. Most of the land is farmed and agriculture is the main source of income for the economy. There are many birds and fish."
Transportation.
"Ferry services go much of the time to Lerwick (in Shetland). Most islands have air strips (for airplanes). This includes the shortest known flight service in the world, between Westray and Papa Westray. Official flight time is 2 minutes. If the wind goes in the right direction, the flight can take just over a minute."
Methodism
"For many games, the Jokers are removed from the deck, making the total number of cards in the deck 52. Sometimes the deck is reduced to 40, 36, or 32 cards for playing certain games, like belote, sheepshead or euchre."
Tarot cards.
"There are various types of tarot cards. Tarots are commonly used for fortune-telling, although they can also be used for playing games. Conversely, people have also used standard playing cards for fortune-telling."
History.
"Playing cards have been found in 9th century China, Tang dynasty."
"Playing cards first entered Europe in the early 14th century, probably from Egypt. The suits were very similar to the tarot suits of Swords, Staves, Cups and Coins. These designs are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese card decks."
"The first documentary evidence is from Vitoria-Gasteiz (now Spain) in 1334, in which the Knights of the Band are forbidden to play cards. The next record is from Catalonia in 1371."
Wide use of playing cards in Europe can be traced from 1377 onwards.
Manufacture.
"The method of making cards has stayed the same for over a century. Cards are two thin pieces of paper stuck together with black paste. Both outer sides are printed. Inside is the design of the card face, the outer is the design for the pack as a whole. The black paste is essential to prevent sight of the face coming through when light shines on the face side. The use of the paste is the reason cards are sometimes called ""pasteboards""."
"One or two packs at a time are printed on large sheets of paper, already pasted. The individual cards are stamped out by a machine which acts like a cookie-cutter. It cuts 36,000 cards per hour. A tiny fraction of a second later the edges of the cards are squashed extra-thin. This is not obvious to the naked eye, but the effect is that the cards slide easily past each other during shuffling."
"Printed paper cards hold about 97.5% of the world market. Plastic cards do exist: they were first invented in the 1930s. They last longer than papercards, but have only 2.5% of the market."
Emperor
"An emperor is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language ""imperator"". Often it is capitalized."
"A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an ""empress"". The wife of an emperor is also called empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates."
"The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (""tennō""), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy."
"The English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an ""imperator"" was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called ""emperor"" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (""basileus"", ""autokrator"") in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (""imperator"", ""Kaiser"") in Austria and Germany, Russian Empire, Serbia and Bulgaria (""tsar""), and the Ottoman Empire (""sultan"", ""padishah"", ""khagan"", ""kaysar"") in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire."
"The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves ""King of Kings"" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (""Huangdi""), Iran (""Shah"") and Ethiopia (""Negusa negast"") are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Brazil and Mexico, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while."
"Palmdale, California"
"Palmdale is the largest city in the desert area of California. It is a suburb of Los Angeles. It has a population of 147,897 and is the 6th largest city in Los Angeles County. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, currently the 25th fastest. It has a population of 589,043 if you include the suburbs around it."
"Even though Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, it is not connected to the larger Los Angeles population area. It is separated from it by a mountain range called the San Gabriel Mountains that are over 40 miles wide and almost 2 miles high overall."
"Palmdale is the home of several airplanes used by NASA and the Air Force, giving it the nickname of ""the aerospace capital of America."""
Palmdale is the largest city in the United States without a hospital.
"Palmdale Airport will have one airline called United Airlines that flies to San Francisco, California everyday starting in June 2007."
The city's demographics is primarily Mexican and white.
History.
"In 1886, when land in the Antelope Valley sold for 50 cents an acre, a group of 50 Swiss and German families migrated from the Midwest and settled in what is now known as Palmdale. They named their new community “Palmenthal” because they had mistaken the native Joshua trees for palm trees."
The high desert community of Palmdale has rich agricultural roots and a unique aviation history.
"The City of Palmdale celebrated its 50th anniversary of incorporation on Aug. 24, 2012. It has consistently been one of the fastest-growing cities in California and in the country. Since 1980, Palmdale’s population has soared from 12,277 to 158,605. Despite its growth, Palmdale continues to cherish the small-town values of a family-oriented community while enjoying all of the conveniences of its booming retail and commercial sectors."
"In 1772 Captain Pedro Fages, a Spanish soldier in pursuit of deserting sailors, crossed the southern part of the Antelope Valley into Leona Valley."
A manicure is the act of beautifying one's hands or fingernails. Manicures can be done at home or by a professional in a nail salon.
"During a manicure, the nail is filed with a nail file; the free edge of the nail is cut, the cuticle is treated, the person's hand is massaged and nail polish is put on."
History.
"5000 years ago, manicures were first used. Henna was used in India for manicure. The word mehendi, another word for henna, derives from the Sanskrit mehandika. Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, had very long naturally-grown nails."
Dietitian
A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.
"Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers."
In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.
"The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians."
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
"Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers."
"Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well."
Mycology
"Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and psychoactive substances."
A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist.
"Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi."
"Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants."
"Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle."

Suryavanshi
Suryavanshi refers to a person belonging to the Solar Dynasty of the Rajputs .
The Suryavanshi clans are:
Some other castes are also Suryavanshi like:-
Chandravanshi
"Chandravanshi or Candravaṃśa is a legendary principal house of the Kshatriyas varna, or warrior–ruling caste mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (Soma or Lunar). The Hindu deity Krishna is believed to be born in the Yaduvanshi Ahir branch of the Lunar dynasty."
"According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas."
"According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururavas who became the first Chandravanshi emperor of the planet. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas"
"In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses."
By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna &amp; later becomes the King of Mathura.
"As the only surviving grandson of Krishna, all branches claiming descent from Krishna (Krishnaut Yadavas) descend from him."

"Zack and Douglas Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard) are two of the most popular people at their Southern California highschool. Zack's girlfriend, beautiful Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), who is also very popular, breaks up with him so she can instead be with Brock Hudson (Owen Wilson), who is famous after being on a reality television show. Zack is sad but tells himself, he could make any girl in the school popular by making her his girlfriend. Zack and Douglas's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. (Paul Walker), does not believe him and makes Zack bet that he can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks, and Douglas's childhood friend Donald Hamilton (Richard Hammond) believed that Zack could turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. But Dean chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), an unpopular art student, who prefers to spend time by herself."
"Zack and Douglas tries to make friends with with Laney, but she ignores them and walks away. Zack and Douglas's sister Mac (Anna Paquin) tells them to try again, but to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack and Douglas go to the restaurant where Laney works, and with the help of Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson (Elden Henson) gets her to give them a chance. Laney takes them to a small theater where she will be performing in a drama show. To embarrass him, Laney has Zack and Douglas called on stage to perform. Zack manages to make up a performance, telling a story while kicking a Hacky Sack which he happens to carry in his pocket, while Douglas plays guitar while plays harmonica at the same time. Laney is impressed, but rejects them again after he tries to charm her."

Zack and Douglas talk to Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good."
A prisoner of war is a person who was captured by the enemy in a war.
Fachhochschule Düsseldorf
"The Fachhochschule Düsseldorf is a so-called Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences), that means a special kind of college, with technical, design and business subjects in Düsseldorf."
It was founded in 1971.
Psychoanalysis
"Psychoanalysis is a field of psychology and medical therapy. It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others."
"Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children."
The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:
The unconscious mind.
Sometimes people cannot say why they are feeling the way they feel or acting the way they act. What causes the feelings and actions is called the unconscious mind in psychodynamic theory.
Different methods.
"Under the broad umbrella of ""psychoanalysis"" there are at least 22 different approaches to the theory and clinical treatment. The term also refers to a method of studying child development."
"Freudian psychoanalysis uses a type of treatment where the subject (analytic patient) talks, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams. From these the analyst works out the unconscious conflicts which cause the patient's symptoms and character problems. By interpreting them for the patient, the analyst creates insight into the problems. The analyst identifies and clarifies the patient's pathological defences, wishes and guilt."
"Psychoanalysis has been criticized on many fronts. It has been called a pseudoscience, and lacking in empirical support. However, it remains influential within psychiatry, more so in some quarters than others."
Zaandam
"Zaandam is a city in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It has about 74,000 inhabitants (2014). It makes part of the municipality of Zaanstad."
First settlements in the region were known up from the 11th century.
Czar Peter the Great visited Zaandam in 1697 and 1717.
Windows 3.x
"Windows 3.x was a family of Microsoft Windows operating system, released in 1990-1994. Notable operating systems in this family include Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing many things at once). Windows NT 3.x was released in 1993-1996."
"It also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These included a calculator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start&gt;Run&gt;progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better."
"Windows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support."
Woodwind instrument
"A woodwind instrument is an instrument belonging to the woodwind family. Traditionally they were always made of wood, although some of them are now made of metal or plastic."
In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument. Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes:
"The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments. The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves. The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra. It plays one octave higher than the flute. There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute. Flutes are still sometimes made of wood, but mostly they are metal."
The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute. There is a larger version called the cor anglais (which means: “English horn”). This is a double reeded instrument. The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute. The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet. The bassoon is the lowest of the four.
"Then in 627, Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself. However, they could not pass the trench that the Muslims had dug around Medina. After several weeks, the coalition broke up and went home. The Medinians were considered victors."
The truce with Mecca.
"After the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina, the Muslims became stronger. The pagans then decided to sign a truce with the Muslims. This means that they would not fight each other for ten years. The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia. In three years, many people changed their religions to Islam."
"But, this truce did not last for long. After three years of it, a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them. The Muslims in Medina heard of this, and the truce was canceled. Abu Sufyan, the third leader of Mecca in Muhammad's lifetime, tried to resume the truce, but Muhammad politely refused the offer. Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca. After Mecca was captured, they went on to capture the Torkan."
The capture of Mecca.
"In 630, most people in Arabia had become Muslims, and they became part of Muhammad's large army to capture Mecca. Because of the big size of the army, the people of Mecca were afraid to fight back. Abu Sufyan, who was feeling unhappy over the broken truce, went to Muhammad's camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness. Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him, so he returned home. While he was with Muhammad, he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony (ash-Ashaada):"
"""I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."""
"The next day, the Muslim army walked towards Mecca. Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Ka'aba, believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal ibn Ribah, a former Ethiopian slave, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"Abu Sufyan heard this in his home. From this, he learns that Muhammad forgave him. At that time, Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba. The idols were statues that were worshiped as gods. Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca. In the end, Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer. This was Muhammad's victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia. But, because he was old, he would not live for long."
His death.
"In 632 AD, on June 8, Muhammad became very sick. Before he died, he told his followers about his death. He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) is. In Medina, his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid al-Nabawi and shouted to the people:"
"""If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah(SWT) (God), let it be known that Allah(SWT) (God) is alive and cannot die."""
"Although Muhammad died, Islam soon spread all over the Middle East. Then, centuries later, it continued till it reached Africa, Asia and Europe. Islam has become one of the world's biggest and fastest-growing religions."
Relations.
"When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with ""Peace and Blessings be upon him"" (Arabic: ""sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam""). For example, ""Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him)"". In printed matter, a calligraphic symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr succeeded Muhammad. Shias believe that Ali should have succeeded."
Legacy.
Images of Muhammad.
"Most Muslims do not make or show images of Muhammad. The Qur'an does not state that images of Muhammad must not ever be made, but it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols. There are also passages against the creation of images of God in the Hadith. Muslims, especially Sunni Muslims, believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad. When people create images of Muhammad, some Muslims may view this as disrespectful, offensive, and emotionally injurious."
"In 2005, a Danish newspaper published political cartoons of Muhammad. More than 100 people died during the ensuing demonstrations. Johan Galtung, a Norwegian mathematician and peace activist, tried to help both sides come together and talk about this. According to Galtung, the attacks against Danish institutions ended after the government had invited talks."
"On 7th January 2015 the Kouachi brothers, hooded and armed with Kalashnikovs, burst into the editorial meeting of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, shooting at the assembled people. They killed cartoonists Cabu, Charb, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, economist Bernard Maris, proof-reader Mustapha Ourrad, police officer Frank Brinsolaro who was protecting Charb, Michel Renaud, founder of the Rendez-vous du Carnet de voyage festival invited to the meeting, and caretaker Frédéric Boisseau. They also seriously wounded cartoonist Riss, journalists Philippe Lançon and Fabrice Nicolino, and webmaster Simon Fieschi."
"As they left the building, just before killing policeman Ahmed Merabet who was lying on the pavement wounded and begging for mercy, the terrorists shouted: “We’ve avenged the prophet, Muhammad”."
"In addition, the following murders have been officially linked to the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, a policewoman was killed in the suburb of Montrouge. Four people were taken hostage at a supermarket in the east of Paris. These were Yohan Cohen, 20, who worked at the supermarket, Philippe Braham, 45, a business manager for an IT firm, Yoav Hattab, 21, a student and the youngest supermarket victim, Francois-Michel Saada, 64, was a former pension fund manager."
"Amedy Coulibaly, 32, the hostage-taker in the supermarket, has also been linked by Paris prosecutors to the shooting and wounding of a 32-year-old jogger in a park in south-west Paris, on the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack."
Wives.
A list of his wives' names in chronological order
Khadijah bint Khuwaylid.
"Abdullah ibn Jafar reported that he heard Sayyiduna Ali saying in Kufa that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""The best of the women of her time was Maryam, daughter of Imran, and the best of women of her time was Khadijah, daughter of Khuwaylid."" She was 40 years old when they got married."
Sawda bint Zamʿa.
Sawda bint Zam'a was the first woman to immigrate to Abyssinia in the way of Allah.

"Aisha was a young girl. She is described as very intelligent with a very good memory. Aisha spent the next nine years of her life with Muhammad, she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity, and reported a lot of Muhammad's narrations. She married Muhammad when she was nine years old."
Hafsa bint Umar.
Court rulings.
Section 2 has been the source of every Supreme Court ruling directly addressing Twenty-first Amendment issues. Early rulings suggested that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers.
"In ""State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co."", (1936), the Supreme Court held that a state could require a license fee for importing beer from other states and also for manufacturing beer within the state. The court recognized that ""Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional"" for a state to require a fee for such a privilege."
"In ""Craig v. Boren"" (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of proposed legislation with different ages for males and females regarding alcohol consumption in Oklahoma (age 18 for females, age 21 for males). The Court overturned the motion because of a presumed violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment."
"In ""South Dakota v. Dole"" (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to states in which the legal drinking age is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful. The Court held that the limitations on spending power in the Twenty-First Amendment did not prohibit Congress to indirectly achieve federal objectives."
"In ""44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island"" (1996), Rhode Island passed a law that banned liquor advertising from places that did not sell liquor. The petitioners based their suit on their First Amendment right to free speech. In a unanimous decision the Court held that states cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment. However, the Court acknowledged the state was empowered to regulate the sale of liquor under the Twenty-First Amendment."
United States presidential election
"The election of the President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect vote in which citizens cast ballots for a set of members of the U.S. Electoral College. These electors then cast direct votes for the President and Vice President. If both votes result in an absolute majority, the election is over. If a majority of electors do not vote for President, the House of Representatives chooses the President; if a majority of electors do not vote for Vice President, the Senate votes. Presidential elections occur quadrennially on Election Day, which since 1845 has been the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, coinciding with the general elections of various other federal, state, and local races. The most recent United States presidential election was held on November 3, 2020."
Eligibility.

Litomyšl Castle.
"The dominant feature of Litomyšl is a monumental Renaissance castle. It was built from 1568 to1581 by the House of Pernštejn. Litomyšl Castle was originally a Renaissance arcade-castle of the Italian type. Its design and decoration is fantastic. There is a rich sgraffito decoration on the walls. Later, the Baroque features were added in the 18th century. The architect of the building was Giovanni Battista Aostalli. The first owner and the donator was Vratislav II. from Pernštejn. In the castle grounds there is Castle Brewery, too. In Catle Brewery there was born Bedřich Smetana, a famous composer. The castle was written on the UNESCO Heritage list in 1999. The International Smetana´s Opera Festival takes place there every June."
Knights´ Hall: the oldest house in Smetana Square.
"This is one of the most beautiful houses in Litomyšl square. It was built by a stonemason Blažek after a fire in 1540. It was finished in 1546. The stone facade is decorated with decorative and figurative motives. On the sides of the middle window there are 2 statues of the knights. They are famous from story by a popular writer Alois Jirásek. The house is decorated with other figures (a merchant, a mermaid, a lion, a unicorn). There is a town gallery today."
Church of the Raising of the Holy Cross.
"The church was founded in 1378 (638 years ago) in gothic style. Most of equipment is from the second half of the 18th century. The main altar was built in 1767, sculpture decoration was made by František Pacák. The altar image of the Holy Cross was painted by Ignác Raab. There was a massive renovation of the building from 1995 to 2000. In May 2000, the new organs were instaled there The church is a dominant of the historical part of the town, now."
Church of the Discovery of the Holy Cross and Piarist college.
This church is located opposite Litomyšl Castle. The church was built in baroque style. It was designed by Giovanni Battista Alliprandi. He was a famous architect from Italy. The church was constructed from 1716 to 1726. There is a former piarist college on the left of the church.
"It is a Catholic church. It was demaged in the 20th century. The renovation was done at the beginning of the 21st century. Now people come here to pray, listen to the concerts and visit exhibitions. You can climb up to the roof and have a look around the historical town centre."
In front of the church there is Regional Museum Litomyšl. The museum building used to be a grammar school.
Behind the church there is Monastery garden. It is a renovated garden which is a very popular park now.

Eeverybody can come there."
Portmoneum (Museum).
"The history of the Museum of Jan Vachal began in 1920 when an artist Váchal decorated a house of his friend. Vachal's wall paintings in the Portmoneum are very complicated.The paintings are citations from Váchal´s stories. The painted topics are a country and a number of devils, spirits and ghosts. The museum was opened thanks to the Paseka publishing house in the honour of Vachal's work. It was opened in 1993. It was called the Portmoneum after the house owner Portman."
Smetana´s Cultural House.
"Tradition tells that he was a member of the Sanguini family. Before being elected, he was the cardinal-priest of the church of Santa Susanna in Rome."
He died on 15 March 931 in Rome and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Pope Stephen VII.
Korea University Museum
"Korea University Museum is in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It was established in 1934 as the first university museum in Korea. When it was first established there used to be a separate university museum building. But in 2005, Korea University Museum was moved to the Centennial Memorial Samsung Hall which is on the right side of the main gate. The museum is divided into four floors including the basement floor. There are five exhibition halls including Centennial Hall, History Folklore Hall, Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Hall, Donation Hall and Special Exhibition Hall."
Layout.
"On the first floor is the Centennial Hall, which introduces the 100 years of Korea University. This hall is divided into four parts including the history of Korea University, two theme rooms and a theater room which shows the past and history of Korea University."
"History Folklore Hall is on the second floor displaying ceramics, Buddhist art of Korea, calligraphy and paintings. The History Folklore Hall is divided into two rooms: Joseon Dynasty Room and Ancient Art Room. Joseon Dynasty room is divided into five parts displaying cultural relics of Joseon Dynasty: the earth and the sky of Joseon, life of Joseon, patterns of Joseon, social system of Joseon, life of Min Yeong-hwan and Yu Kil-chun. Ancient Art Room displays ceramics, Buddhist art, and traditional paintings of  Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, Goryeo and Joseon."
"The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room, which exhibits the paintings and sculptures of Korea's modern art, is on the third floor. The Contemporary &amp; Modern Art Room displays the modern art of Korea which shows the influence of Western art techniques. This room presents the transfiguration of Korean traditional paintings."
"Also, the Donation Hall is on the third floor exhibiting the relics which were donated to the university museum."
"The Special Exhibition Hall, which is open occasionally for special displays, is in the basement floor. Special exhibitions are held three to four times every year."
Collection.
"Korea University Museum possesses approximately one hundred thousand relics including three National Treasures, which are Honcheonsigye, Donggwoldo and Buncheong ware. Also, the traditional Korean paintings by Sim Sa-jeong, Jeong Seon and Kim Hong-do and modern arts by Park Su-geun, Whanki Kim and Yi Eungro are in display. The museum displays various relics of all times in fields of history, archaeology, folklore and art, continuously developing a variety of exhibitions and education for public."
"Honcheonsigye, National Treasure of Korea No. 230."
"Honcheonsigye is a celestial globe clock created by Song I-yeong in 1669. The clock has an armillary sphere with a diameter of 40 cm. Unlike Chinese astronomical clock, it could measure the accurate time by observing the whole movement of universe. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon Dynasty. An image of the clock's sphere is shown on the reverse of the 2007 issued 10,000 won banknotes."
"Donggwoldo, National Treasure of Korea No. 249."
"Donggwoldo literally means ""Painting of Eastern Palace."" The painting depicts the Eastern Palaces, Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung in 19th century. ""Donggwol"" is an alternative name of Changdeokgung, which means it is located to the East of the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty,Gyeongbokgung. The palaces in this painting were depicted elaborately in details so its value as the reference of Joseon Dynasty's palace arrangement is great."
"Buncheong ware, National Treasure of Korea No. 177."
"Buncheong ware or  Punch'ong ware, is a type of celadon in grayish blue color. It is a style of Korea's traditional stoneware, which emerged in the middle era of Joseon Dynasty. It started to lose its popularity after 16th century with the appearance of white porcelains. Korea University Museum owns a special Buncheong ware which was a jar to contain the placenta of Royal Family in Joseon Dynasty."
Poitou
Poitou was a province of France of west-central France whose capital city was Poitiers.
"There is a marshland called the Poitevin Mar on the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort."
"Many of the Acadians who settled in what is now Nova Scotia beginning in 1604 and later to New Brunswick, came from the region of Poitou. After the Acadians were deported by the British beginning in 1755, a number of Acadians eventually took refuge in Poitou and in Québec. A large portion of these refugees also migrated to Louisiana in 1785 and following years became known as Cajuns."
Kristubhagavatam
"Kristubhagavatam is a mahakavya (an epic poem) written in Sanskrit. It is based on the life of Jesus Christ. It was written by Mahakavi P. C. Devassia. Devassia was a Sanskrit scholar from Kerala, India."
Pope John VII
Pope John VII (650 – 18 October 707) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1 March 705 until 18 October 707 when he died.
His father was Plato was a curator of the Palatine Hill. This makes him the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official.
"He had bad relations with the Quinisext council of 692 but had good relations with the Lombards, who had ruled much of Italy at the time. Liber Pontificalis criticized Pope John VII for not signing Canons which were really unpopular in Italy at the time."
"Alfredo Magarotto (16 February 1927 – 22 January 2021) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop. He became a priest in 1950. He was bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chioggia, Italy, from 1990 to 1997. He was bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vittorio Veneto, Italy, from 1997 to 2003."
"Magarotto died on 22 January 2021, aged 93."
Konthoujam Nongarol
"Konthoujam Nongarol (), also spelt as the Konthoucham Nongkalol, is an ancient Meitei literary narrative work, about Chingphulon Konthousu, a lady from Konthou clan, ascending to the Heaven. The story describes about the love between a mortal and a deity. It also mentions about how the ancient people perform ceremony for the death."
Photosystem II
Photosystem II is a large protein complex. It is the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis.
"The complex is in the thylakoid membrane of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria."
"In the photosystem, enzymes capture photons of light to energize electrons. The electrons are then transferred by coenzymes and cofactors. The energized electrons are replaced by oxidizing water to form hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen."
"By replenishing lost electrons with electrons from the splitting of water, photosystem II provides the electrons for photosynthesis to occur."
Sharon Kay Penman
"Sharon Kay Penman (August 13, 1945 – January 22, 2021) was an American historical novelist. She was born in New York City. She was known for writing novels about English and Welsh royalty during the Middle Ages."
"Her best known works were ""The Sunne in Splendour"", ""When Christ and His Saints Slept"", ""Here Be Dragons"", ""The Reckoning"", ""Time and Chance"" and ""Devil's Brood""."
"Penman died from pneumonia on January 22, 2021 at the age of 75."

Poireiton Khunthok
"""Poireiton Khunthok"" () or ""Poireiton Khunthokpa"" () (literally, immigration by Poireiton) is an ancient Meitei literary narrative work (puya), describing about the immigration of a band of colonies, led by a man, Poireiton, the prince and younger brother of Thongaren, the god of the underworld kingdom, in the plains of the Kangleipak kingdom (present day Manipur)."
"It is partially an allegorical work, which includes mythical elements as the integral parts of the saga. It also mentions that the knowledge of the usage of fire was also introduced to the people of Kangleipak by Poireiton."
Poireiton
"""Chingkhong Poireiton"" (), also known as ""Poileiton"" (), is a prince of the Khamnung (underworld kingdom) and a younger brother of Thongaren, the god of death in Meitei mythology and religion. He is best known as a cultural hero, for leading a colonial immigration to the human world (Kangleipak kingdom), as per the wish of his brother."

Joint
A joint is the place where two or more bones make contact. They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support.
"Joints have cartilage in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described structurally and functionally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones."
Synovial bursa.
"A synovial bursa is a small fluid-filled sac lined by a synovial membrane. It has an inner capillary layer of viscous synovial fluid (bit like raw egg white). The bursa is ""a cushion between bones and tendons"" and/or muscles around a joint. This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement."
Hosni Mubarak
"Muhammad Hosni Said Mubarak (; 4 May 1928 – 25 February 2020), commonly known as Hosni Mubarak (), was an Egyptian politician. He served as President of Egypt from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011."
Mubarak became the vice-president of the Republic of Egypt after moving up the ranks of the Egyptian Air Force. Then he became the President after President Anwar Sadat was assassinated on 6 October 1981. His almost thirty-year presidency made him Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha.
"As President of Egypt, Mubarak is thought to have been one of the most powerful leaders in the region. Under the 1971 Constitution of Egypt, Mubarak exercised strong control over the country and was generally considered a dictator. In 2005, he called an election and easily won it. Many opponents believed Mubarak changed the election results so he could win."
"In early 2011, during the Arab Spring, there were huge protests against his government. In the end, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to the armed forces. It is hoped that elections later that year for a new government. On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the shooting of protesters in the revolution that ousted him."
"On 13 January 2013, Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak's sentence and ordered a retrial. On retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on 9 May 2015 of corruption and given prison sentences. Mubarak was detained in a military hospital and his sons were freed 12 October 2015 by a Cairo court."
He was acquitted on 2 March 2017 by the Court of Cassation and released on 24 March 2017.
"He died on 25 February 2020 at a Cairo hospital after having surgery, aged 91."
Euclid
"Euclid of Alexandria () (about 325 BC–265 BC) was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria. Little is known about this person, but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh. It is not known where and when he was born."
The Elements.
"Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry, which is part of mathematics. His ""Elements"" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms."
"The ""Elements"" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of ""greatest common divisors"". They were in his ""Elements"". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers."
"The geometrical system described in the ""Elements"" was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries which mathematicians developed in the 19th century."
Other works.
"Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work."
"On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves."
The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.
Adenovirus vaccines.
"The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them."
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca).
"In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
Ad5-nCOV.
"The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military."
Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.
"The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration."
CoronaVac.
"The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac."
Sinopharm vaccine.
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trial.
"The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19."
Nasal vaccines.
"Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines."
Statistics.
"As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people."
"African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated than other Americans, as are people in the Southern United States."
Arthur's Nose
"Arthur's Nose is the popular first book of the book series, written and illustrated by Marc Brown. It was published in 1976. Arthur is an aardvark. The character of Arthur inspired several other picture books and was also made into an animated television series."
"In this first book, Francine the monkey teases Arthur for having a big nose. As a result, Arthur decides to get his nose cut shorter. However, instead, he leaves his nose the same and his friends are happy, except Francine."
Prey Veng province
Prey Veng is a province in Cambodia. The capital city is also named Prey Veng.
It is on the east bank of the Mekong river. The Bassac River is also in the province.
Primatology
"Primatology is a type of science that is part of zoology. It studies primates (monkeys, apes, lemurs, and humans). Primatology is a part of physical anthropology. A person who studies primatology is a primatologists. They can work in many different fields of study. These include biology, zoology, anthropology and psychology."
"A large amount of information about primatology has been learned since the end of World War II in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Japan. In the United States, primatologists work mostly in the fields of psychology and anthropology."
Orangutan
"Orangutans (""Pongo"") are great apes belonging to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. There are two species of orangutan. They are from Southeast Asia. There are very few of them left, because loss of the jungle has reduced their habitat. There are orangutans on view at the Singapore zoo."
"The name orangutan comes from two Malay words, ""orang"" which means ""person"", and ""hutan"" which means ""forest""; so orangutan means ""person of the forest""."
Appearance.
"Orangutans have red-brown hair. They have long arms. They can be strong like chimpanzees, gorillas and humans. They also have hands that are good for climbing. The ""Sumatran Orangutan"" is smaller and has longer hair than the ""Bornean orangutan"". Orangutans have suffered from forest loss and are on the very edge of extinction."
Life.
"Orangutans are from the rainforests on the islands Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. They mostly live up in the trees. They eat fruit, leaves and bark and also insects and bird eggs. They drink water from rain that has been collected in leaves. Orangutans are not comfortable on the ground since they have to push themselves along with fists. Heavy adults move carefully through the trees, using their flexible feet to grasp the tree branches. Smaller orangutans swing with more ease."
Diet.
"An orangutan's diet consists mainly of fruit, they like ripe fruit. If they cannot find fruit they will eat bark, leaves and termites, rather than move to somewhere else to get food. About 60% of an orangutan's diet is fruit, 25% is leaves, 10% is bark and flowers, and 5% is termites and other insects."
Pregnancy.
"After a pregnancy of 230–260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby, but sometimes two, every eight to nine years. The little ones stay with their mother for years, riding on their mother's back and learning to move through the forest. The young orangutans are playful and affectionate. When they are five or six years old, they become more independent and eventually go off on their own."
Greeting
Greetings are nice things to say when people meet each other. Greetings may be different from culture to culture. These are some greetings used a lot in the English language:
"There are also ways to greet without talking, such as these:"
Sunlight
"Sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the Sun. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation. What we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation. It is the radiation and heat from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic waves."
"The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere (16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the Earth's surface."
"Without sunlight, there could not be life on the Earth. Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it. Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without enough sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very moist."
"Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body uses the ultraviolet part of sunlight to make its own Vitamin D. Without sunscreen too much ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Sun angle makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night. A high angle makes the tropics hot, and a low angle makes the arctic cold."
Intensity of sunlight on planets of Solar System.
Different bodies of the Solar System receive sunlight of different intensities. The table compares the amount of light received by each planet on the Solar System follows:
Use of solar energy.
"Solar energy is used in many different ways by people all over the world both in its traditional way for heating, cooking or drying and to make electricity where other power supplies are absent, such as in remote places on Earth or in the space. Sometimes, it is cheaper to make electricity from sunlight than from coal or oil."
Theism
Amazon River
"The Amazon River (also called ""Rio Amazonas"" in Portuguese and Spanish) is the largest river in the world by the amount or volume of water it carries. It flows through the tropical forests of South America, mainly in Brazil. Its headwaters are in the Andes Mountains in Peru, on the western edge of South America and flows eastward into the Atlantic Ocean near the equator."
"The Amazon River moves more water than the next eight largest rivers of the world combined and has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season, parts of the Amazon exceed in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called ""The Sea"", but it is not the world's ""longest"" river system. The world's longest river is the Nile River, with the Amazon being second-longest."
Overview.
"All the main tributaries to the Amazon River have their own names. They start in the mountains (Andes) as clear water with high oxygen content, and connect with the other rivers as they all flow towards the mouth of the Amazon."
"The water of the Amazon ends up full of mud. This is especially true of its Rio Negro tributary). In the nutritious mud live a huge number of insects, small crustacea, parasites. On these small fry live predators, birds, fish and life generally. The mud is what causes this huge array of life. The mud has nutrients, and on this the flies and fish all the other animals depend."
Size and path.
"It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length. As the studies have come up with different numbers, it is therefore difficult to give an exact number. The length also changes in the rainy season. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of . The Amazon may have a length of . The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at . In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of ."
"A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of . This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon. Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over ."
"The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the ""River Sea."" The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru. Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil, and most of South America, to the city of Iquitos in Peru."
"One characteristic of the Amazon river is the ""Brazo Casiquiare"", a water connection to the Orinoco river into Venezuela, that connects the two basins."
Estuary.
"The estuary of the Amazon is about wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is wide, and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames river in England."
"Along the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about . The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called a tidal bore. Locally it is known as ""pororoca"". The pororoca occurs where the water is less than deep. It starts with a loud noise, and advances at a speed of . The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach . The place has become popular for river surfing."
Uses.
The Amazon River has many uses:
"""Uses"" suggests that the wonders of the Earth are there for our taking. They are not. It is up to us what we do, and the Amazon has already been greatly damaged by greed and corruption. Logging its trees and changing the ecosystem to farmland is already far advanced."
Bridges.
"There are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, so there is no need to build a bridge. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro (a tributary of the Amazon)."
"The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Most cities are on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas. Many native people live in the Amazon, such as the Urarina who live in Peru."
Trade route.
"Big ocean boats can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers (900 miles) from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m (26 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point."
Pyramid
"A pyramid is a structure, usually made of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures."
"The word ""pyramid"" comes from the Greek word ""pyramis"" which meant ""wheat cake."" The ancient Egyptian word for them was something like ""Mer"". The Great Pyramid of Giza was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world."
The first pyramids were built in 2630 B.C. The oldest known pyramid was made for king Djoser of the third Dynasty.
Egyptian pyramids.
"In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in the tombs of huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today."
"The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is in the Giza Necropolis in Saqqara, near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. Herodotus was told by his Egyptian guides that it took twenty years for a force of 100,000 slaves to build the pyramid (with another ten years to build a stone causeway that connected to a temple in the valley below)."
"People once thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recent evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. Many valuable items were buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures."
A large statue of a Sphinx stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh.
"Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she realizes her therapist was in on it and that the plane is another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin."
Cast.
"Isabelle Fuhrman and James Frain appear in the film's alternate version as Claire and Henry, respectively, in a plotline revealing the puzzlemaker's story. Tanya van Graan makes an uncredited appearance as Sonya, who is Henry's wife and Claire's mother in this cut."
"Additionally, Lucy Newman-Williams appears as Zoey's therapist and Scott Coker portrays an FBI agent in the theatrical cut. In both versions, Matt Esof portrays the vagrant who lures Zoey and Ben into Minos' trap."
Production.
"On January 27, 2020, director Adam Robitel posted on social media confirming that filming on the movie had wrapped."
Appetite for Destruction
"Appetite for Destruction is the first studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records."
"When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"". It was first on ""Billboard"" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time."
"Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, ""Appetite for Destruction"" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too."
Background.
"Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after forming, with ""Don't Cry"", a cover of ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Think About You"" and ""Anything Goes"". However, the EP did not happen, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band."
"After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP ""Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide"", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP."
"Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for ""Appetite for Destruction"", such as ""Back Off Bitch"", ""You Could Be Mine"", ""November Rain"" and ""Don't Cry"". ""November Rain"" was not put on the album because ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad."
"Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record ""Nightrain"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Don't Cry"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Shadow of Your Love"". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)"
"The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded ""Shadow of Your Love"" first with Clink as a test."
"In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman) to ""spruce up"" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie ""Big Daddy"" in 1999."
Track listing.
Super deluxe edition.
"The ""Locked N' Loaded"" Edition and the ""Super Deluxe Edition"" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album."

It includes all of ""Appetite for Destruction"", alongside bonus tracks ""Shadow of Your Love"", ""Patience"", ""Used to Love Her"", ""You're Crazy"", and ""Move to the City (1988 Acoustic version)"".

"Thomas Callan Hodson, the then British Political Agent of 1908 Manipur, quoted in his monograph, The Meitheis, as follows:"
&lt;poem&gt;
"""The women hold a high and free position in Manipur, all the integral trade and exchange of the produce of the country being managed by them. The habit of the country is to have bazars (markets) at convenient spots by the road side, where a handful of women congregate at the early hour...!"""
&lt;/poem&gt;
List.
Leima Linthoingambi.
"Leima Linthoingambi was the queen of king Ningthoukhomba (1432-1567) of Manipur. During the invasion of the Ankla tribes, the king had to proceed at the war field. At the King's absence in the capital city, the Tangkhul tribes raided the city. But in disguise as the king, the queen resisted their revolution by offering strong wine at the king's absence. With her wits, the kingdom was saved. This account is recorded in the Ningthourol Lambuba."
Kuranganayani.
"Kuranganayani, originally known as Shija Phongalokpi, is the biological daughter of King Gaurishyam and the adoptive daughter of King Bhagyachandra. She was offered hand in marriage to the Ahom king to strengthen the relationship between the two kingdoms as well as to get military aid from the Ahoms for the Meiteis to resist the Burmese conquest of Manipur. But she turned out to be a heroine even in the Ahom kingdom. It was she who saved the Ahom kingdom from the hands of the Moamoriya revolts."
Yairipok Thambalnu.
"Thambalnu was a lady from a poor family in Yairipok town of Manipur. But her beauty and charm causes conflicts among many able men in the kingdom in her times. During flood times from the Imphal river in the kingdom, the Royal Oracle proclaimed that the water god Wangbren will be pleased if a young girl is offered to Him. Since Thambalnu became a problem for numerous men, she was chosen to be offered to the deity. So, she was forcibly (or voluntarily) put in sacrifice to the strong river flow. After her death, the flood was also gone."
Maharani Kumudini.
"Queen Kumudini was widowed when her son was at a ripe age. She devised many diplomatic relations and plots to protect the throne from the other family members of the royalty. When her son, Chandrakirti became the king, she was known as a popular feminine icon in the kingdom."

The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974."
Cheongsam
"Cheongsam (长衫) is typical, traditional clothing for Chinese women. Also known as Qipao (Ch'ipau)."
"A cheongsam usually has two long slits at either side of the hem for convenient movement and display of the legs. Unlike a short skirt, the slits of cheongsam show a woman's legs when she walks."
"A more formal description is: a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric left-over-right opening (youren) and two side slits."
"The modern Cheongsam was developed in Shanghai in the 1920s. Several alterations have been made to the design. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1940s, as many noble and high-class women wore it. Although the cheongsam is thought to be traditional Chinese clothing, it is modern."
The traditional Qipao evolved from Manchu women's Changpao during the Qing Dynasty.
Kikuyu
Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya. They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.
History.
"There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia."
"According to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi."
Kikuyu language.
"Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is ""Wi mwega?"" which means ""Are you fine?"". There are a few Kikuyu dialects depending on region. Kikuyus from Nyeri, for instance, have other forms of greeting including: ""Wakia Maitu"" greeting an elderly female, ""Wakia Awa"" greeting an elderly male, and ""Wanyua"" for agemates."
"The Kikuyu language is also similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though English and Kiswahili are the main languages spoken in Kenya across tribes, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride."
Famous Kikuyu people.
"Famous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)"
Incheon International Airport
"Incheon International Airport is the largest international airport in South Korea where all international flights leave and arrive every day. Gimpo Airport located near city Seoul used to be the international airport for Korea. However as the population grew and needs for places to stay increased in the area, Gimpo Airport no longer could expand its capacity to meet the growing demands for international flights. To solve the problem, a construction plan for a new 24 hour airport was started in 1992. Incheon International Airport is in Incheon City Jung-gu Unseo-dong (37°27′5″N, 126°26′4″E). Incheon International Airport Railroad (A'REX) and Incheon International Airport Highway were built to join the airport to Seoul. The airport is operated by Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC) and it is owned by the government of South Korea."
History.
"Incheon International Airport opened on March 29th, 2001. It was built on reclaimed land between Yongjongdo and Youngyudo. First stage of building started in 1992 and it took eight years and four months to finish. It cost 7.8 trillion Won. This allowed Incheon International Airport to have up to 170,000 flights, 27,000,000 passengers and 1,700,000 tons of cargo per year. Stage Two began in 2002 and was completed on June 20th 2008. The airport now has the capacity of holding 410,000 flights, 44,000,000 passengers, and 4,500,000 tons of cargo per year. When the airport is finished in 2020, it will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and four parallel runways. It will be able to have up to 100 million passengers, and 7 million tons of cargo per year."

"Lao and Thai are both Tai languages and are very similar to each other. In fact, speakers of northern Thai dialects and Lao claim that they can largely understand each other, making the dialects mutually intelligible."
History.
"Lao is one of the Tai languages, spoken in what is now northern Vietnam and southern China. Mongol invaders and expansion in China pushed the Tai people south towards India. Their language was influenced by other languages in the region like the Mon-Khmer and the Austronesian languages. The written form of Lao originally came from the Pali language in India. The script form was brought to the region by Buddhists about two thousand years ago."

Shows.
"The channel plays up to 15 hours of live shows every day. 6 hours of these are opinion shows. The hosts of its opinion shows are Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Tucker Carlson introduced to the network by Group CEO Gerard Bevan along with Geraldo Rivera. Fox News Network leans right-wing, but has some liberals (such as Greta van Susteren)."
Criticisms.
"There was a documentary called ""Outfoxed"" that criticized the channel because they say it is biased towards conservatives and the US Republican Party in its reporting. Fox says its opinion shows are conservative but its regular news programs are not. President Barack Obama, through a spokesperson, accused Fox News of working for the Republican Party. Fox has also been accused of having a right-wing bias, racism, discrimination, race baiting and gender inequality. Roger Ailes has called Fox News ""the balance"" against the liberal networks news groups such as ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, Cable News Network, and MSNBC."

Question mark
"The question marker (?), also referred to as the question point, question stop, question sign, interrogation marker, interrogation point, interrogation stop, mystery marker, mystery point, mystery stop, mystery sign, query or eroteme or the question mark, interrogation mark or mystery mark for short, is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a sentence when asking a question."
"The symbol is thought to come from the Latin quæstio, meaning ""question"", which was shortened to Qo. The uppercase Q was written above the lowercase o, and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today."
"Another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century, when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted."
"Some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark. This is thought to come from a French practice and is called French spacing. In French a space is always put before question marks, exclamation marks, colons, and semicolons. In English, however, using this space is thought of as bad form. Some English books do have these spaces, but are often a very thin space, which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read."
Vasily Chuikov
"Vasily Chuykov (February 12, 1900 – March 18, 1982) was a medieval fish."
"During World War II he was commanding the 62nd army, with which he was especially outstanding himself in the Battle of Stalingrad."

Power Purchasing Agreement
"A Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner. The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines."
Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.
"Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider."
Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases.
Some of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:
Pioneer plaque
The Pioneer plaques were a pair of plaques that were launched into deep space on Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. The same image is on both plaques. The image is made up of many parts.
There is a drawing of a nude human female and a nude human male.
There is a diagram of the change in spin of the electron of a hydrogen particle. This diagram is meant to set up a universal unit of length and a universal unit of time for the rest of the image.
"There is a crude map of our solar system showing a spacecraft leaving the third planet, Earth. There have been negative reactions about the arrow showing the trajectory of the spacescraft. Alien species may not understand the human concept of a line and arrow."
"There is pattern of lines that looks like a star burst design. This is a map. There are 15 lines. 14 of the lines have a long binary number engraved along it. The binary numbers are distances. The distances are not in meters or kilometers, but in the universal unit of distance given by the hydrogen particle diagram. The 14 lines give the distance from the sun to 14 pulsars. The 15th line gives the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy."

"Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree."
"Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie."
"Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, ""A Voyage to Terra Australis""."
Induction coil
"An induction coil or ""spark coil"" is a type of electrical transformer. It is used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter."
"The induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in X-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is for ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction."
Frodsham
"Frodsham is a small market town in the county of Cheshire in the north west of England, north west of Chester, on the River Weaver, and overlooking the River Mersey estuary."
"The town is of Saxon origin, its 11th century church is mentioned in the Domesday Book. When a salt refinery was opened in 1964, salt was brought by river from Northwich."
Great Western main line
"The Great Western main line is a main line railway in England, that runs westwards from London Paddington to . It opened in 1841 and was the original route of the old Great Western Railway. In 1948 it became the Western Region of British Railways. It is now part of the national rail system managed by Network Rail."
Electrification.
"The line was electrified from Paddington to Heathrow Airport in the late 1990s. Work to electrify the rest of the route started in 2011. The aim was to complete the work all the way to Bristol by 2016. Parts of the programme have been deferred because costs have tripled. The four sections deferred are: Didcot to Oxford, Bristol Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads, Royal Wootton Bassett Junction to Bristol Temple Meads and the Thames Valley branches to Henley-on-Thames and Windsor."
Train services.
Most trains are operated by Great Western Railway.
South Western Railway (train operating company)
"South Western Railway (SWR) is an English train operating company owned by FirstGroup (70%) and MTR Corporation (30%) that operates the South Western franchise. It operates commuter services from its Central London terminus at London Waterloo to South West London. SWR provides suburban and regional services in the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, as well as regional services in Devon, Somerset, Berkshire and Wiltshire. Its subsidiary Island Line operates services on the Isle of Wight."

Bee Gees
"The Bee Gees were a British–Australian pop group. For most of its history, the band consisted of three brothers all of whom were born on the Isle of Man, a British Crown Dependency. The brothers, Barry Gibb (born 1 September 1946), and twins Maurice Gibb (22 December 1949 – 12 January 2003) and Robin Gibb (22 December 1949 – 20 May 2012), started singing at a young age when living in Manchester. In the late 1960s, the band briefly expanded to include Australian born Vince Melouney and Colin Petersen. When the band reformed after splitting in 1969, Australian born Geoff Bridgford briefly became a member. The Bee Gees existed for almost 40 years They are most famous for their album, ""Saturday Night Fever"", the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. They stopped performing after Maurice died. The two other brothers reunited as a duo in 2009. In 2012 Robin died. They had a younger brother, Andy Gibb (1958–1988), who was also a singer."
Group history.
"The Gibb brothers were born on the Isle of Man, then lived in Manchester, England, before moving to Australia in 1958. It was in Australia that the Bee Gees' band was formed. In January 1967, the Gibb brothers returned to England where their band the Bee Gees started to become internationally famous. In 1967, Colin Petersen and Vince Melouney joined the band but by the end the decade both had left and the brothers themselves had briefly gone their separate ways, only to reform in 1970. Between 1970 and 1972, Geoff Bridgford was a member of the Bee Gees. In 1975, the brothers relocated to the United States."
Improverts
"The Improverts are an improvised comedy group based in Edinburgh, Scotland. They are a part of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company. Their home is the Bedlam Theatre. It has been their home since they were created 18 years ago. The group is similar to ""Who's Line is it Anyway?"", Comedy Store Players, and Keith Johnstone in that they use short improvised games."
They have taken part in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival almost every year since they were formed. Also they have played every Friday night during the school year (as their main audience is Edinburgh University students).
"Because they are always in Bedlam Theatre, the theatre technicians improvise the sounds, music and lights along with the scenes the performers are doing. The sounds can be loud and annoying at times. The technicians show off their very big iTunes library of songs and sound effects. British 80's children's programmes' themes are a favourite of theirs."
"Past players have gone on to many different things. They have created an improv group in London, joined the Stand Players' ""Who's Lunch is it anyway"" free improv show at Edinburgh's The Stand comedy venue and become successful stand up comedians. Some have starred in British sitcoms, television dramas, movies and popular children's programmes"
Taipei 101
"Taipei 101 () is 101-floor building in Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan). In 2004, it replaced the Willis Tower (which used to be called the Sears Tower) as the tallest completed building in the world. However, in 2010, it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai."
Taipei 101 holds records for:
"Taipei 101 does not hold the record for tallest building from ground to pinnacle. The Sears Tower has two television antennas on top of it, making its height from the ground to the top of the taller antenna 527 m (1,729 ft)."
Effect on Taipei's economy.
"Taipei 101 is the recognized symbol of Taipei city, it brings a lot of tourists every day. The location of Taipei 101 is at the southern end of the Xinyi District, the newest area of Taipei city. Besides the tower, the base of the building houses includes a multi-level shopping mall, food court, various restaurants and stores, and an global grocery store. Every New Year's Eve, Taipei 101 is host to an impressive fireworks display that attracts people from all over Taiwan and other neighboring countries like Japan and Singapore to the area."
Observatory Information.
"The Taipei 101 Observatory is open every day from 9AM to 10PM. The observatory is spread over 4 floors where visitors can enjoy the fantastic scenery and learn about the engineering marvel that is Taipei 101, the tallest green building in the world. Visitors can buy the tickets on the 5F Taipei 101 Mall, the general ticket costs NT$500 per each and the student ticket (with valid ID) costs NT$450 per each, all children (under 115 cm) are free. After purchasing the tickets, visitors may take the Guinness World Record breaking high-speed elevator to the observatory on the 89TH floor."
"The 88th floor is the Beauty of Taiwan Multimedia Corridor, Super Big Wind Damper, Treasure Sky, the hallway connecting the two decks is designed to setting the natural beauty of Taiwan, providing 270-degree views of well-known scenic locations in Taiwan, leading to the engineering marvel known as a wind damper, a 5.5 meters diameter, 660 ton weight suspended within the building to offset the force of wind and help 101 stand upright. Also included is Treasury Sky, a collection of unique jewel crafts."

Other zinc compounds are:
Occurence.
"Five isotopes of zinc are found in nature. 64Zn is the most common isotope, with 48.63% of naturally occurring Zinc. This isotope has a half-life of 4.3x1018 years. This is so long, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, (0.6%), with a half life of 1.3x1016 years is usually considered to not be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are (28%), (4%) and (19%)."
"Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's crust. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. Sphalerite, a mineral that is made of zinc sulfide, is a main ore of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores."
"There are some other zinc ores, such as smithsonite (zinc carbonate) and a zinc silicate mineral. They are less common."
Preparation.
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by flotation. There is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide.
The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide.
The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate. This makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more.
"The zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed. This electrolysis makes oxygen, zinc, and sulfuric acid. This makes a pure zinc that is known as ""SHG"" or special high grade."
The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide.
Zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. This is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made.
This form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure.
Zinc is the fourth most commonly used metal in the world. About 10 million tons are made every year.
Uses.
As a metal.
Zinc is used in electrical batteries. The alkaline cell and the Leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most. It becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run.
"About 59% of zinc is used for corrosion prevention, which includes galvanizing. 47% of the world's zinc is used for galvanizing. This is used to protect another metal, usually iron, from rusting. The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron. The zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways. The metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc. The zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal. Dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice. It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a ""bullet"" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free."
"Zinc is used in alloys. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. Zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good bearings. Commercial bronze has zinc in it. Sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a semiconductor. Nickel silver is another zinc alloy."
"Zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ. An alloy of tin and lead was used in the past. Zinc is used in the US penny, which only has a thin layer of copper. The core is zinc. Older pennies were made completely out of bronze."
"A mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket. This reaction makes zinc sulfide, heat, light, and gases. Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars."
As zinc compounds.
About 1/4 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds. Zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment. Zinc oxide also is a semiconductor. Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot. Some fungicides have zinc in them. Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments. Zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light.
In biology.
"Humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well. If they do not get enough zinc in their food, they can get a mineral deficiency. Almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections. Some people say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Others say that zinc does not make a difference. There are medicines that one can use when they have a cold. People add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc. Most single-tablet vitamins have zinc in them. Zinc is found in at least 100 enzymes. It is the second most common transition metal other than iron. Zinc also is used by the brain. The human body contains 2 to 4 grams of zinc. A zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood. Whole wheat has much zinc in it."
Safety.
"Large amounts of zinc metal are toxic. It can dissolve in stomach acid. When too much zinc is eaten, copper and iron levels go down in the body. Zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach. Zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell."
Zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water.
Zebra
"Zebras are mammals of the family ""Equidae"". Zebras are African horses. They are in the same genus as the common horse, ""Equus caballus"", and donkeys. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main species of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra."

Banco Galicia
"Banco Galicia is a private bank of Argentina. It belongs to the Grupo Financiero Galicia. It was founded in 1905 as Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires, and traditionally its Board of Directors was made up of members of the Escasany, Ayerza and Braun Menéndez families. Its shares began trading on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in 1907."
History.
"Banco Galicia was founded in 1905 by a group of businessmen from the Galician community in Argentina, and in 1907 its shares began trading on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. In 2000, Grupo Financiero Galicia was created and became the controlling company of the Bank, acquiring 100% of its shares in 2014."
"The commercial network grew significantly at the end of the 1950s and continued to expand to the 326 branches it has today, developing its potential and earning its reputation as an innovative bank, currently considered a leader and reference within the national banking industry."
"In the late 1950s, Banco Galicia launched the capital investment fund FIMA Acciones and founded the predecessor of the asset manager Galicia Asset Managment."
"As part of its growth strategy, Banco Galicia began to expand into rural areas in the interior of the country, where it was believed that there was high growth potential. Access to financial services in the interior was limited compared to Buenos Aires and its surroundings, and its population used fewer banking services."
"In 1979, it launched the first ATM network in the country, together with 4 of the main banks in the financial system. In order to expand its network throughout Argentina, in 1986 Banco Galicia offered to open 13 branches with ATMs in the province of Santiago del Estero in exchange for placing the Bank's characteristic symbol on the province's flag, as well as It is how today the cross of Santiago can be seen on the provincial flag."
"Between 1995 and 1999, Banco Galicia acquired shareholdings in various entities and formed several non-banking companies that provided financial services -mainly through the issuance of own-brand credit cards- and insurance."
"In 2000, it launched the first Internet financial portal in Argentina and in 2006 the first payment service through a bank's cell phone in Argentina."
"After being significantly affected by a deep economic and financial crisis in 2001 and 2002, Banco Galicia managed to recover to resume its leadership position. It is currently one of the main banks in the Argentine financial system, being the most important among those in the private sector with national controlling capitals."

Public domain
"Public domain is a phrase that describes something that belongs to all people in general: the public. The public domain contains works (such as books, films, or paintings) that are not under copyright protection."
"The ""opposite"" of ""public domain"" is copyrighted material, which is owned either by the creator of the work or their estate. The term ""public domain"" is only used to describe things that can be copyrighted, such as photographs, drawings, written articles, books or plays, or similar works of art. As a general rule, all intellectual property works, after enough time has gone by, will become part of public domain. Examples include the works of Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare and Ludwig van Beethoven, and the books of Isaac Newton."
A work can enter the public domain in many ways.
"In some cases, if a work enters the public domain after copyright expiration, anyone using the work may still be required to note who created the work. Even if some works are in the public domain due to not being copyrighted, there may be still non-copyright usage restrictions. For examples, even though the design of national currencies may be ineligible, or be unsuitable, for copyright, counterfeiting them for fraud is widely a very serious crime. Another example are logos and images that only have text or simple shapes. These logos aren't copyrighted in the United States, but they are often protected by trademarks."
Child
"A child (the plural is children) is a person below the age of puberty (biologically) or below the age of majority (legally). A person can be called his or her parent's child, no matter how old he or she is, a synonym for the word 'child' is ""kid""."
"In rich countries, children go to school. Small children may go to nursery school, preschool or kindergarten. Playing with small toys and using their imaginations are important for child development. But often in a developing country, children sometimes work in factories or in the fields with their parents or guardians."
"When two people get married and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this marriage, that child is called a ""step child"" by the child's non-birth parent. If both people had children, the children of each parent are ""step brothers"" or ""step sisters"" of each other. A child whose parents have died is an orphan. Orphans with no parent may be raised by grandparents or other relatives. Otherwise they may go to live in an orphanage. They may be adopted by another adult or couple wanting a child. They will then be able to grow up in a new family."
Nickelodeon
"Nickelodeon (often shortened to Nick) is a worldwide cable television network. Airing Sundays-Fridays from 7 a.m.-8 p.m. and Saturdays from 7 a.m.-9 p.m. It is made for children. The network was started in 1983 as Pinwheel. During the late mornings and afternoons, Nickelodeon shows Nick Jr.. This is a group of learning programs and series for younger children. They are shown while the older children are in school. At night, the network shows Nick @ Nite. Nick at Nite is a group of reruns of older series that parents watched when they were younger."
Programming.

Nicktoons.
"Nicktoons is the branding for Nickelodeon's original animated television series. Until 1991, the animated series that aired on Nickelodeon were largely imported from foreign countries, with some original animated specials that were also featured on the channel up to that point."
"Though the Nicktoons branding has seldom been used by the network itself since the 2002 launch of the channel of the same name, original animated series continue to make up a substantial portion of Nickelodeon's lineup. Roughly 6 to 7 hours of these programs are seen on the weekday schedule, and around nine hours on weekends, including a dedicated weekend morning animation block."

'The Force'.
The Force is a mystical power. Those who can harness if for good follow a religion known as the Jedi. It is a belief that the force flows through every living thing. In the words of Obi-Wan Kenobi:
"People who can control the Force with their minds get a number of psychic powers, such telepathy (reading others thoughts), telekenesis (moving things with their minds), precognition (knowing about things before they happen) and mind control (telling people commands they must follow)."
The Jedi and the Sith.
"The Jedi are a group of beings who use the Force to bring peace and harmony to people, planets, and cultures. They are trained to use the force for good purposes. They are sworn enemies with another group called the Sith."
"The Sith are a group of beings who use the force as a power source; they are trained to use the force to gain ultimate power. The Sith normally use the force to gain power in battles with their enemy who are the Jedi. They also use the force to bring destruction to the universe and anything in their way. They are the antagonists, and they usually use red lightsabers in contrast to the variety of colors used by the Jedi. There are usually only two Sith, a master and an apprentice."
Lightsaber.
"The lightsaber is a dangerous and powerful weapon used by the Jedi and the Sith. It can be described simply as a light sword. These weapons are very special to a Jedi or Sith. They are custom built to special specifications by the Jedi or Sith. The Sith tend to take a Jedi's lightsaber as a prize if they win the battle. Many epic battles have been fought with lightsabers between the Jedi and the Sith. For the lightsaber to be a weapon it is powered by a special crystal called a kyber crystal.The kyber crystal comes in many different cololrs such as: Red, white, yellow, orange, and many more. The reason it is powerful and dangerous is that when someone touches the blade, one gets burned straight away."
Story.
"Anakin Skywalker is a young boy who meets Obi-Wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the Force (and to become a Jedi). Although Jedi are not allowed to get married, as an adult, Anakin falls in love with Senator Padmé Amidala and they get married. Anakin later goes to the Dark Side and turns against Obi-Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi. Then Darth Sidious renames him Darth Vader. Before he turned against his wife, Anakin had two children with Senator Amidala, Leia and Luke Skywalker, who he does not know about. Senator Amidala dies after giving birth to their twins. After birth, the twins are separated to prevent Vader and the Dark Side from finding and hurting the children. Obi-Wan Kenobi sends Luke to a planet called Tatooine to live with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa of the planet Alderaan; she is called Princess Leia Organa."
"When they get older, Luke and Leia meet again. At first they don't know that they are brother and sister, but they eventually find out. They help fight the evil government, called the Galactic Empire. Luke also learns the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. In the end, they defeat the Empire, with the help of the Rebellion, and Luke helps his father Anakin become good again. Unfortunately, Anakin dies. The galaxy is then saved for a while."
"Thirty years later, however, the Empire rises again in the form of the First Order. However, the New Republic does not believe that it is a threat. Those who do believe form the Resistance, led by Leia. Luke has vanished, and Leia has married Han Solo. They had a child, named Ben, but Ben was corrupted by the First Order and a dark-side force user named Snoke and is now called Kylo Ren. Rey, a desert scavenger, fights with Han against the First Order, but Kylo Ren kills his father. However, Rey still manages to gain a large defeat against the First Order with the help of the Resistance. Rey then finds Luke, who was searching for the first Jedi Temple and for more knowledge about the Jedi, however Rey is then disappointed to see that Luke has given up on the Jedi. Meanwhile, the Resistance is slowly being wiped out ship-by-ship as they are chased by Snoke's ""Supremacy"", and on the verge of the faction's death, Vice-Admiral Holdo rams the Resistance's flagship into the First Order fleet to save the resistance. The remnants are later forced to an old rebel base in the planet Crait, where they put up a valiant fight but are slowly wiped out until Luke, the Spark of the Resistance, shows up in a vision to grant time for the others to escape, becoming one with the force in the process."
Star Wars creatures and droids (robots).
The Caretakers of Ahch-To
"The manatee nuns from “The Last Jedi” may not take an immediate liking to Rey, but we sure like them. These wise caretakers in cream-colored habits are as cute as they are intense."
Ewoks
"Yes, Lucas went overboard with the killer teddy bears of Endor, populating film and TV projects with these forest fuzz-warriors. And it was their very engineered-for-cuteness factor that first divided Star Wars fans as pro- and anti-Ewok a long time ago — even if some naysayers softened a bit after the bar was lowered in 1999 by Jar Jar Binks."
R2-D2 and C-3PO
"Although the narrative may separate them, they are an inseparable joint entry here, befitting their place as a great action-comedy team. R2-D2 is the droid that Resistance royals are forever looking for — the beeping do-it-all mechanic and sometime projector. And C-3PO is the know-it-all, fussy butler of protocol, languages and odds-making."
Expanded universe.
"Many books, short movies, and video games have been produced that deal with events that do not happen in the original movies. They also tell more about things that did happen in the movies. For example, the book ""Death Star"" tells about the building and destruction of the space station from the original movie. It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station. A different example is that in the Expanded Universe, sometimes the Sith are shown as the protagonists. Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empire's defeat. They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5,000 years before to more than one hundred years after Episode VI."

Korean language
The Korean language is spoken mainly in North and South Korea. It is spoken by more than 78 million people (most are North or South Koreans).
"In South Korea, it is called ""hangukmal"" (한국말) or ""hangugeo"" (Hangeul: 한국어, Hanja: 韓國語). In North Korea, however, it is called ""choseonmal"" (조선말) or ""choseoneo"" (조선어, 朝鮮語). They are named differently because the common names for North and South Korea are different. Additionally, Koreans usually call their language ""urimal"" (Hangeul: 우리말) or ""urinara mal"" (Hangeul: 우리나라 말), meaning ""our language"" or ""our country's language."""

"His son Brian and daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company. His daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, plays the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson."
"One of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It is called Muppet*Vision 3D. It opened in 1991, shortly after his death."
Game Boy Advance Video
"Game Boy Advance Video is a format of cartridges for the Game Boy Advance. They work the same as normal cartridge but play television shows instead of games. They generally contain 45 minutes of TV, for example, a show from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. They were first made in early 2004, but gradually stopped being made shortly before there were no more Game Boy Advance games made in 2008, with the final game for it being Samurai Deeper KYO."
Butterfly
"A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved. The earliest discovered fossil moth dates to 200 million years ago."
"The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants, which their larvae (caterpillars) feed on, and their adults feed and lay their eggs on. They have a long-lasting history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa. The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below."
"Angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved in the Lower Cretaceous, but did not become common until the Upper Cretaceous. Butterflies were the last major group of insects to appear on the planet. They evolved from moths in the latest Cretaceous or the earliest Cainozoic. The earliest known butterfly fossils date to the mid Eocene epoch, between 40 and 50 million years ago."
"Like moths, butterflies have four wings covered with tiny scales. When a butterfly is not flying, its wings are usually folded over its back. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. There are many different kinds of butterflies. The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught."
"Like all insects with complete metamorphosis, a butterfly's life goes through four distinct stages. It begins as an egg, which hatches into a larva (a caterpillar). After some time, the larva turns into a chrysalis. While it is in the chrysalis stage, it changes to become an adult butterfly. To complete the cycle, adults mate and the females lay the eggs."
"Butterflies are any of the species belonging to the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hedyloidea. Butterflies, along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their distribution."
Predators and defences.
Predators.
"The main predators of butterflies are birds, just as the main predators of the crepuscular moths are bats. Also monkeys and tree-dwelling reptiles are predators, and some insects and spiders. All reptiles and monkeys have good colour vision, so that butterfly coloration works just as well on them as it does on birds."
Defences.
The extraordinary colours and patterns on the wings and body can only be understood in terms of their function. Some of the most obvious functions of colour are:
"The details vary from group to group, and from species to species. The caterpillars also have colours with similar functions. The poisonous substances which make some butterflies noxious to eat are got from the plants eaten by their caterpillars."
Body.
"Like most insects, butterflies have three main body parts. These parts are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The body is protected by the exoskeleton. The body is made up of sections, known as segments. In between the segments there are flexible areas that allow the butterfly to move. All three parts of the body are covered in very small scales. The scales give the butterfly its colour."
Wings and flight.
Butterflies have a very characteristic flying style. They usually do not fly in straight lines. Their style is well described by the children's version of their name: 'flutter-by'. The way they fly presumably makes them harder for birds to catch.
"Some species are capable of strong, long flights (see monarch butterfly migration) and others never leave the woods they were born in. They can survive bird pecks on the wings. Late in the season damage to their wings can often be seen, though they continue flying quite well."
"When they are alive, it is often difficult to see they have four wings. The wings on each side are linked by a row of little hooks. So in practice they fly as if they had one large wing on each side."
Head.
"The head is the first part of the body. It has the eyes, mouth parts, and antennae."
"The eyes of a butterfly are large. Like other adult insects, the eye is made up of many small lenses or ""optical units"". these are compound eyes. Butterflies do not see as many colours as humans, but they can see ultraviolet light."
"The mouth of an adult butterfly does not have jaws. It has a kind of mouth that sucks liquids. This mouth is made of two hollow tubes. The tubes are locked together in the middle. When the butterfly is not drinking, the tubes are coiled up. It can uncoil them when it wants to drink. Like all insects, the adult phase is about reproduction. The main eating phase is done by the larvae, which usually eat plant food."
"The antennae of a butterfly are used for smell and balance. The antenna in most butterflies is clubbed at the end. In some butterflies (like the skippers), there is a hook at the end of the antenna, instead of a club."
Thorax.
The thorax is the second part of the body. It is made up of three segments. The legs and wings are connected to the thorax.
"There are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.p.4 These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.p.4 In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal."
"However, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas."
Men and women.
"Alcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased."
"Female alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives."
"In the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.p.21"
Young people.
"In many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.p.10"
Treatment options.
Alcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.
Detoxification.
"Detoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. ""Detoxification"" means ""getting toxins out of the body."" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more."
"It is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called ""detoxes"" or ""rehabs."" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.p.35"
"Once a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called ""sober"". Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober."
"Detox can be an intense process, and some people experience very strong emotions during it. This is complicated by the fact that, in the past, they may have used drugs or alcohol to help them handle strong emotions. In detox, the therapist helps them manage their emotions."
Therapy.
"Psychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober. For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to:"
Medications.
Some medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include:pp.130-144
Vitamins.
"Many alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed.p.144"
Groups for alcoholics.
"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program. This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused."
"There are also other groups for alcoholics, like:"
Other websites.

Groups for alcoholics and their families
Sprain
"A sprain is a type of injury in which a person hurts the part really bad, but it is not broken. It has common side affects of a broken bone, but it is less serious."
Degrees.
The first degree is only a minor tear or stretch of a ligament.
"These missions were an important part of Spanish rule because if a mission was built in a place, it would be harder for other European countries to claim that land for themselves."
"In these missions, the Native Americans were taught European ways. They learned how to speak Spanish and the basics of the Catholic faith. They also farmed and made things such as candles and clothes. However, some Native Americans did not like living in the missions. They thought the Spanish were treating them wrong and they fought back."
Death.
"Serra died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in what is now Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. He is buried there. People go to his grave to pray in his name."
Sainthood.
"Serra was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1988. When he was beatified, it means that the Catholic Church recognizes that he went to heaven and can intercede on behalf of people who pray in his name. He was also now called ""Blessed."" However, he was not a saint yet because beatification is step 3 out of the 4 steps of becoming a saint in the Catholic Church."
"In 2015, Pope Francis canonized Serra. That means that he is now officially recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church and has his own feast day (July 1 in the United States, August 28 everywhere else). July 1 is his feast day in America to honor the day he arrived in San Diego."
Legacy.
"There are many statues of Junipero Serra in California. There are also many places named after him, such as schools and roads."
Criticism.
"People have criticized Junipero Serra for his treatment of the Native people who live in what is now the state of California. They said that he beat them up and didn't allow them to practice their own cultures and religions. However, other people say that Serra did a lot of good things for the Native people. Unlike other Europeans at the time, he thought that the Native Californians had souls. He also taught them how to read and write."
"In 2020, many statues of Junipero Serra were damaged and pulled down. Other statues of him have been removed and put away. These events have taken place in light of the George Floyd protests, when people were working to end racism in American society."
Preludes (Chopin)
"Preludes, Op. 28 is a collection of 24 short musical works for solo piano, written by Frédéric Chopin between 1837 and 1838 and published in the middle of 1839, just after the composer's winter stay on the isle of Majorca with George Sand."
"Chopin was greatly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach when he wrote these preludes. Each of the works in the collection is in a different major or minor key, with not one being left out, just like Bach's 24 preludes and fugues in ""The Well-Tempered Clavier"". But unlike Bach, Chopin arranges the preludes in order through the circle of fifths. The first prelude in the set is in C major, the next in A minor, then G major, E minor, and so on, until the last two, which are in F major and finally D minor."
"The ""Preludes"" are all very different. Many are very short (they take only about one minute each to play), so the atmosphere changes quickly, and this can make the overall structure seem out of place. Artists have recorded the entire set of preludes on CDs, and they are often performed in concerts as well."
"One of the well-known pieces from the ""Preludes"" is Prelude No. 15, in D-flat major and nicknamed ""Raindrop"". This nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment. It reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops. Another well-known number is Prelude No. 4, in E minor, with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment."
"Besides the 24 preludes of Op. 28, Chopin would write three more preludes, Op. 45 in C-sharp minor (composed in 1841), one in A-flat major (1834), and the so-called ""Devil's Trill"" Prelude, in E-flat minor, which Chopin never ended up finishing."
Union Kleinmünchen
"Union Kleinmünchen Linz is a women soccer club from Linz, Upper Austria. It was founded in 1980 and was the first club, which is a pure women soccer club. The colours of the team are red and white."
History.
The club was founded in 1980 and started playing in the highest league. From 1980 till 2008 they played each season in the highest class. The season 2008/09 they played for the first time in the 2. league but next season (2009/10) they could reach the championship and were promoted to the ÖFB-Frauenliga.
Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 (Pastorale) is a symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer began making sketches for the symphony in 1806. The symphony was completed in 1808 in the village of Heiligenstadt northwest of Vienna. It was first performed in Vienna, Austria on 22 December 1808 in the Theater an der Wien with the premieres of the Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, the ""Choral"" Fantasy, ""Ah! perfido!"" (a concert aria composed in 1796), and excerpts from the Mass in C major of 1807."
"There are five movements in the symphony. The movements in order are allegro ma non troppo (""Joyful Feelings Upon Arriving in the Country""), andante molto mosso (""By the Brook""), allegro (""Peasant Merrymaking""), allegro (""The Thunderstorm""), and allegretto (""The Shepherd's Song After the Storm""). The first movement is in sonata form. It is placid and cheerful. It depicts the composer's feelings as he arrives in the country. The second movement is in sonata form. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe) and cuckoo (clarinet). The third movement is the scherzo movement of the symphony. It depicts the country folk dancing and it ends unexpectedly when the country folk notice that raindrops are starting to fall. The fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, starting with just a few drops of rain and building to a climax. There is, of course, thunder, as well as lightning, high winds, and sheets of rain. The finale is in sonata rondo form. The first eight bars form a continuation of the introduction of which the storm was the main part; the finale proper begins in the ninth bar."
Australasia
Australasia is one of the world's geographical regions. It is unified in natural history and geology because of its ancient origin as part of the supercontinent Gondwana. It is the geographical area which contains the Australasian ecozone.
"Its islands are all south-east of the Bali–Lombok line, known as the Wallace Line, after Alfred Russel Wallace. The main political entities are Australia, Indonesia and New Zealand. The main islands are:"
"Maria Amalia of Saxony (24 November 1724 – 27 September 1760) was a Duchess of Saxony of the House of Wettin and wife of Charles III of Spain. Married to the then King of Naples, at the death of her brother in law Ferdinand VI of Spain, she became the queen of Spain. A cultured woman, she left a considerable architectural legacy in her adopted countries. She was also one of the shortest reigning queen consorts in Spanish history."
Biography.
"She was born at Dresden Castle in Dresden and was the eldest surviving the daughter of Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and Maria Josepha of Austria. She was one of 15 children and was baptised with the names Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga."
Marriage.
"In 1737 Maria Amalia became engaged to the King of Naples and Sicily, the future Charles III of Spain. The marriage was confirmed on 31 October 1737. The following year, 1738, at the age of 14, Maria Amalia married King Charles, on 19 June at Gaeta, a proxy wedding having taken place in May the same year with her brother, Frederick Christian of Saxony representing Charles."
Queen of Naples.
"The couple resided in Naples and were very content. This marriage was looked upon favourably by the Holy See and effectively meant the conclusion of the diplomatic disagreement Charles and the See had had. Festivities lasted till 3 July. Maria Amalia was a very cultivated woman and played an important role in the construction of the Caserta Palace as well as the Palace of Portici, Teatro di San Carlo, Palace of Capodimonte as well as the Royal Palace of Naples. She also popularised Neapolitan porcelain at the ""Capodimonte Porcelain Manufactory"" in 1743. Maria Amalia was also a patron of the composer Gian Francesco Fortunati who was a favourite at the Neapolitan court. She ans Charles eventually had 13 children."
Queen of Spain.
"At the end of 1758, Charles' half brother Ferdinand VI was displaying the same symptoms of depression that his their father used to suffer from. Ferdinand lost his devoted wife, Barbara of Portugal in August 1758 and would fall into deep morning for her. He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily."
"That same year they left Naples for Madrid, leaving two of their children behind in Caserta. Her third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, while his elder brother Infante Charles was groomed in Spain to inherit the Spanish crown. Her oldest son the Duke of Calabria was mentally retarded and was thus could not inherit the thrones."
"Charles and his wife arrived in Barcelona on 7 October 1759. Residing in Spain, Maria Amalia once again did much to improve the royal residences having them redecorated and founded another porcelain factory at ""Buen Retiro"". A popular queen, she died of tuberculosis at the Buen Retiro Palace outside the capital having been a heavy smoker. She was buried at the Royal Crypt in El Escorial."
Maria Luisa of Spain
"Maria Luísa of Spain (24 November 1745 – 15 May 1792) was Holy Roman Empress, German Queen, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary as the spouse of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor."
Background.
"Maria Luisa was born in Portici, in Campania, the site of the summer palace (""Reggia di Portici"") of her parents, King Charles, King of Naples and Sicily and Maria Amalia of Saxony. She was the fifth daughter, and second surviving child, of her parents. Her father became King of Spain as Charles III in 1759, and she moved with her family to Spain. Her first cousins included Louis XVI, Maria I of Portugal and Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia."
Grand Duchess of Tuscany.
"On 16 February 1764 she was married by proxy at Madrid to Archduke Peter Leopold, the second son of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and the heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The next year, on 5 August, she married him in person at Innsbruck. Only a few days later, the death of Emperor Francis made Maria Luisa's husband the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the newly married couple moved to Florence, where they would live for the next twenty-five years."
Holy Roman Empress.
"In 1790, on the death of Peter Leopold's childless brother, Joseph II, Maria Luisa's husband inherited the Habsburg lands in Central Europe, and was shortly thereafter elected Holy Roman Emperor. Taking the name of Leopold II, the new Emperor moved his family to Vienna, where Maria Luisa took on the role of imperial consort. Leopold died scarcely two years later, dying on 1 March 1792. Maria Luisa followed her husband to the grave in less than three months, not living long enough to see her eldest son Francis elected as the last Holy Roman Emperor."
"Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia as part of the festivities that accompanied the coronation of Maria Luisa and her husband Leopold as king and queen of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. In musical circles, Maria Luisa is famous for her putative denigration of Mozart's opera as ""German rubbish"" (""una porcheria tedesca""), however no claim that she made this remark pre-dates the publication in 1871 of Alfred Meissner's ""Rococo-Bilder: nach Aufzeichnungen meines Grossvaters"", a collection of stories about cultural and political life in Prague in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."
The Seafarers
The Seafarers is a short movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. It was released in 1953.
Spartacus (movie)
Spartacus is a 1960 American epic historical drama movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel of the same name by Howard Fast. The life story of the historical figure Spartacus and the events of the Third Servile War were adapted by Dalton Trumbo as a screenplay.
"The movie stars Kirk Douglas as rebellious slave Spartacus and Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. Co-starring are Peter Ustinov (who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as slave trader Lentulus Batiatus), John Gavin (as Julius Caesar), Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, John Ireland, Herbert Lom, Woody Strode, Tony Curtis, John Dall and Charles McGraw. The movie won four Oscars in all."
The titles were designed by Saul Bass.
"Anthony Mann, the film's original director, was replaced by Douglas with Kubrick after the first week of shooting."
Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria
The most popular attractions are:
The Amazon rain forest.
"The amazon rain forest is a moist grassy land where many wild animals live and contains the amazon river which is the 2nd longest river in the world and has the largest volume of water. The world's longest river is the Nile in Africa. The forest is known as a rain forest as it rains very often but due to the dense surroundings not every droplet reaches the bottom. The Amazon is shared by eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname) and stretches for 6.7 million kilometers2. In the amazon rain forest, hundreds of thousands of trees have been cut down for wood and paper, meaning that the forest is endangered. Unlike the Boreial forest in Canada the trees are not getting replanted."
Bed
"A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on. It normally has a soft mattress on a bed frame. Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size."
History.
"In August 2020 archaeologists reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from Middle Paleolithic (at least 200,000 years ago). This was much older than the oldest previously known bedding."
"They found insect-repellent plants and ash layers beneath the bedding. This would have made a dirt-free, insulated base which helped to keep away insects. So early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried ferns)."
"Here's an example of what they said: ""Several cultures have used ash as an insect repellent because insects cannot easily move through fine powder. Ash blocks insects' breathing and biting apparatus, and eventually dehydrates them. ""Tarchonanthus"" (camphor bush) remains were on top of the grass from the oldest bedding in the cave. This plant is still used to deter insects in rural parts of East Africa""."
Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in Ancient Rome.
"In Ancient Egypt, beds were considered to be status symbols. While the lower classes simply slept on a heap of palm bows or straw, the wealthy constructed wood platform beds that were ascended by stairs, were often curtained, and piled high with cushions for comfort."
"In Ancient Rome, the bed was utilized as a multi-purpose reclining surface rather than just a place to sleep. Several beds, or ""dining couches"" were arranged around the perimeter of the home's living space, and friends and family would recline in bed while socializing, studying, and dining."
Types of beds.
"There are several kinds of bed in use today. Several terms refer to the size of the mattress. Some kinds are usually temporary, such as camp cots, air mattresses, and hammocks."
Asia
"Asia is a large region on Earth mainly in the northern hemisphere. Asia is connected to Europe in the west, forming a continent called Eurasia, though sometimes it is viewed as a separate continent from Europe. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. Asia was also home to some large empires such as the Persian Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Mongol Empire, and the Ming Empire. It is home to at least 44 countries. Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus are partly are also considered European."
Area.
"Asia includes a large amount of land. Covering about 30% of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent, with about 60% of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers."
"Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Pontic Mountains and the Turkish Straits. A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This line runs north–south down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea."
List of countries.
"Some countries are variously located in both Europe and Asia, namely Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, and Turkey."
"The Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in western Asia, with the rest of the country lying in North-East Africa."
Wall
"A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion, escape, and weather."
"Before powerful artillery was invented, many cities had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most city walls have been removed."
"The term ""the Wall"" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the Pink Floyd album of the same name."
"Sealing people behind walls, in the form of immurement has historically been a method of human sacrifice and punishment."
Retaining wall.
"A retaining wall is a structure made to hold soil from collapsing. It is made in special areas for any other construction work, such as farming or road making."
"Much later, in the 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."
History.
"During the 10th through 13th centuries, when the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia, modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms:"
"These three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. Then, the Protestant Reformation happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814. It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland."
"The borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some territory to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre &amp; Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia). The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway."
"Finland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times. During the wars fought by Napoleon, it became part of Russia."
Minerva (automobile)
"In 1883 a young Belgian called Sylvain de Jong settled in Antwerp, Belgium. He started a bicycle factory there. By the end of that century he started producing motorbikes, and after a while automobiles as well. In 1903 he grounded the NV Minerva Motors' in Berchem (Antwerp)."
"A certain Charles S Rolls was Minerva dealer in England. The small 1 cylinder ""Minervette"" was there with its 105 Pound, the cheapest automobile."
"In the years after the fame of the automobile was rising enormous. Most important market for the constructor remained however England that took the biggest part of the production, followed by the Netherlands and France."
"From 1908 Minerva got a worldwide Knight licence. The Knight motor was a motor without valves, developed by Charles Y Knight in the United States. These motors were extremely silent. The company did well in several automobile racing competitions in Europe."
"After worldwar I, during which Sylvain de Jong and his engineers headed to Amsterdam, where they kept on developing parts, they returned to start up the production of luxury automobiles. The constructors star rose in the United States as well, American filmstars, politicians and industrials liked them cars as well (even Henry Ford had before the WW already one!). The car had the same qualities as the Rolls Royce, but was a little cheaper. With the economical crisis in the 30's, the company went bankrupt in 1936. The remains were taken over by another Belgian constructor named Imperia. Imperia putted the name Minerva on their automobiles for export to England and France and for the trucks (which Minerva had made before too)."
After worldwar II the company produced Land Rovers under licence for the Belgian army. Production of these 4Wheel Drives stopped in 1953. The company struggled for survival and made some Land Rover-like cars till 1956. But than the constructor diappeared completely.
E. B. White
"Elwyn Brooks White (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985) was an American writer."
"He is most famous for his 1959 manual about how to write well in English, ""The Elements of Style"" (which was first written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918), and also for his three children's books ""Stuart Little"" (1945), ""Charlotte's Web"" (1952), and the ""Trumpet of the Swan"" (1970)."
He also wrote for magazines and newspapers in the United States.
"E.B. White won many awards, including a Pulitzer Prize."
Raffles Institution
"Raffles Institution is a highly regarded secondary school in Singapore, often considered the best school in the country. Only boys can go to this school. It has been performing well in studies and sports. It was founded in 1823 as Singapore Institution by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. It is the school with the longest history in Singapore. Its name was changed to ""Raffles Institution"" in 1868. It has two sections, Raffles Institution and Raffles Institution Junior College."
"The current principal of Raffles Institution is Mr Frederick Yeo, who replaced Mr Chan Poh Meng when he left the school at the end of 2017."
History.
"Sir Stamford Raffles founded Raffles Institution on 5 June 1823, making it the school with the longest history in Singapore. Raffles Institution was along Bras Basah Road at first, where Raffles City is now. The school moved to Grange Road in 1973, and then moved to its current location at Bishan in 1990. The Grange Road campus is now the MOE Teacher's Network."
Archipelago
"An archipelago () is a chain or group of islands. The word ""archipelago"" means ""chief sea"", from Greek ""arkhon"" (""arkhi""-) (""leader"") and ""pelagos"" (""sea"")."
"Archipelagos are usually found in the open sea; less commonly, a big landmass may neighbor them, an example being Scotland which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland. Many archipelagos are volcanic, forming along mid-ocean ridges or hotspots. Others are island arcs neighboring an oceanic trench. Many other processes create archipelagos, including erosion, deposition, and land elevation."
"The four biggest countries that are mainly archipelagos are Japan, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Indonesia (the world's biggest country that is an archipelago, according to the CIA World Factbook). The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern Canada, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which is in the Arctic Ocean."
Act I.
"Jaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline’s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure."
"Don Pizarro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree."
"Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King’s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again. So he locked them again."
Act II.
Florestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who is telling him to come to Heaven.
"Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving."
"Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine."
The Overtures.
"Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called ""Leonore 1"", ""Leonore 2"", ""Leonore 3"" and ""Fidelio"". The overture ""Fidelio"" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. ""Leonore 2"" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. ""Leonore 3"", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. ""Leonore 1"" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place"". Sometimes the ""Leonore 3"" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture ""Fidelio"" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814."
Für Elise
"""Für Elise"" (German for ""For Elise"") is the common name of the ""Bagatelle in A minor"", written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. The song is thought to be written for Therese, a woman that Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, however his handwriting was misspelt undergoing transcription, allowing the piece to be known as Fur Elise rather the Fur Therese. Therese did not want to marry him."
"The piece of music, which was written for the piano, was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven’s death. It is one of the most well-known pieces of piano music in the world."
Form.
"The piece is in rondo form. There is a main section (A) which appears three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections (B and C), so the form of the piece can be described as: A B A C A."
"The main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists want to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes)."

Teplice
"Teplice (German name: Teplitz) is a city in Bohemia, the western area of the Czech Republic. Teplice (pronounced in Czech: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there."
Teplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.
"Since 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air. There is a museum and many restaurants, wine bars and cafés. In the winter the mountain slopes are good for skiing."
Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, is a symphony written by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written."
"A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. This one, the last one he wrote, is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it: there are four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a choir. This is why it is known as the “choral” symphony (“choral” means: “for choir”). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual."
"This symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called ""Ode an die Freude"" (in English: ""Ode to Joy""). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe."
"The main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: “Freude, schöne Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium”) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses."
"The ""Ode to Joy"" was adopted as Europe's “National anthem” in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan."
"Beethoven had been interested in Schiller’s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller’s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Caroline Unger, the alto soloist, made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically."
"The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling."
The third degree is a complete rupture.
Signs and symptoms.
The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation:
Joints involved.
"Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:"
Prevention.
"Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains."
Second Sino-Japanese War
"The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 to September 3, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It became part of World War II when Japan entered that war. Part of the Sino-Japanese war was fought in northern Burma and northeastern India. The war ended when Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It started in 1937 43 years after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 lead by Emperor Meiji who was the father of Emperor Taishō and the Grandfather of Hirohito ."
Invasion of China.
The Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war after the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said that a Japanese soldier got lost and they were allowed to find him in Beiping.
Japan invaded China for a few reasons:
"While the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the ""Chinese United Front"". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well."
Japanese occupation of China.
"In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beiping (now called Beijing), and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls."
"After six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied the industrial cities in southern China. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of ""using space to trade for time."" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight, and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China."
"Many soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back, instead of Japan continuing to take over the country."
End of the war 1941-1945.
"After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the area of fighting called the China-Burma-India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons."
"The Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. It had not been able to win the war against China quickly. Instead, Japan's military had already been fighting China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war."
"In China, the war had some important effects. It made more people support the Chinese Communist Party. It also made Chiang's Republic fall apart more quickly, in 1949."
Ligament
"In anatomy, the word ligament usually means the fibrous tissue that joins bones to other bones or cartilages."
"A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue made of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments join bones to other bones to form a joint. They do ""not"" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the amount of movement in a joint, or stop certain movements altogether."
"Ligaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple."
"The result of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined."
Powiat
"A county (Polish: ""powiat"", pronounced ""povyat""; plural, ""powiaty"") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a ""voivodship"" (in Polish, ""województwo"". One would call it in English ""province"")."
Brittle star
"Brittle stars are Echinoderms of the Class Ophiuroidea. The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species."
"Usually they have 5 ""arms"", which can grow long, up to 60 cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth."
"There are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the ""Ophiurida"" (brittle stars) and the basket stars (""Eurialida""). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion."
Description.
"Many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish, which is how they got their name. When they are picked up, their arms may fall off. This might make the animal seem brittle, but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators."
Movement.
"Brittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement, but instead use muscles in their long, thin arms to go around rocks. Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed, and are faster movers than starfish. In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles. Ophiurid arms only move horizontally. The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other plane.p64 In contrast, basket star arms can move vertically. These movement patterns are distinct, and separate the groups."
"Ophiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents."
Basket stars.
"Basket stars (Euryalids) are large brittle stars with many rays. Their arms branch, and can be moved in any direction. This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids. Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends. They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton, they look like the bottom of a basket."
"Basket stars can be large and heavy, the biggest Ophiuroids. The largest, ""Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni"", weigh up to 5 kg (11 lbs) and has arms 70cms long, with a disk diameter of 14 cm."
Bivalve
"The bivalves are a large class of molluscs, also known as pelecypods."
They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.
"There are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves."
"The best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters."
Shell.
"Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth. They are made of a calcareous mineral, calcite or aragonite. The valves are covered by a periostracum, which is an organic horny substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell."
The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim.
Food.
A bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it.
"Some (but not all) molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel."
"Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's stomach and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water."
"The siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs. Those that live above the substrate (sediment), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them."
Feeding types.
"There are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure:"
Movement.
Digging.
"As a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along horizontally along, soft ground such as mud and sand. Common examples of this are razor shells, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and cockles."
Swimming.
"but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,"
I just couldn't hack it.
Uh-huh.
"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today."
So there  was real continuity.
Oh.
She went back as a teenager
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
"Oh, my gosh."
"So, it, it was really neat."
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
"and  she just kept good people and  real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,"
Uh-huh.
Oh my goodness
and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.  That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. You know, to,"
Uh-huh.
you're lucky to have an art teacher
"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know."
Or pay for it after school.
Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
"and   you know, I willingly did it"
Oh is that right?
I had no idea.
"but I thought, this makes me angry."
This is something that ought to be in the schools  rather than some of the other stuff they do.
"I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time,"
and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music.
"Um, I don't have a whole lot of dislikes."
"I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues,"
"and, uh, I like, uh, a lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,"
"Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even."
"Right,"
right.
"Uh, well, that gets,"
"some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music,"
"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,"
"but the, the actual,"
"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even"
"Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music"
"Yeah,"
I guess.
"um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it"
Uh-huh.
Um.
Do you like rap?
"Um, some of it, um,"
it depends.
"I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny, um,"
and they usually do a lot of satire
Yeah
um.
that kind I kind of like.
Right.
"Some of it is kind of pointless,"
"Right,"
"so I bought one that's more like living in a,"
"once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home."
"Oh, that sounds lovely."
It is.
They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
Uh-huh.
so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.
Uh-huh.
"So in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that have those type homes"
and
"Yes,"
definitely.
"uh-huh,"
"and, um, the area that we're settled in is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids."
"They're still doing, um, a lot of building in the neighborhood."
"So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast,"
"and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around."
"So it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors,"
"and you know, um But, um ,"
"Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the, the cold of the northeast"
Uh-huh.
so they settle sort of in-between.
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"Now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are,"
"there lots of pretty trees and,"
Yes
Yeah.
"as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that I live in is very wooded."
"Oh, how pretty."
It is nice.
the air bags are a good deal
"but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh,"
"you really need to do,"
"you need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh, and the seat belts"
"Oh I think so too,"
"so,"
I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.
Yeah.
I'm
but I think you need the shoulder thing
Yeah.
"I think you need the thing around your waist,"
"but, I think you need that bag to pop out too."
Yeah.
"You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that air bag, they may still be walking around."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I think it's fantastic."
I wish they required it in everything.
"Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it."
"It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags."
Would be interesting wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Uh, that wouldn't be fair"
"but, uh,"
"Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, you know,"
"they would have to do it,"
the insurance company would have to do the same thing.
"They're given like, a ten year time limit where,"
Yeah.
okay.
"These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years"
"it's mainly for flower bed,"
"so I'm not going to, no I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there."
All right.
"But, I,"
"yeah,"
I do want to have a raised bed.
"I've never,"
my flower gardens are always been like on the ground.
Right.
"They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up."
"Well, you can see it a little better"
and it stands out.
"Yeah,"
this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch
"and I can tell you there's nothing around it, cement foundation all the way around it. Not a shrub, not a bush."
Um.
"There was a lilac tree,"
"and the landlord cut it down and said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding"
"And I'm looking at him like, Jeez."
People would kill to have a lilac bush
and he's cutting it down
So. That's all right.
Flower beds are all right.
"Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding."
"Rub up against the siding. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast."
"Some people, uh, would really like to have them,"
"and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over their lawn."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're kind of a pain,"
"but, you know, people who don't have them think they're great."
"we can't do that,"
we just can't do that.
And I'm going well how about this way?
"I, I want to do that,"
that was the plan here
Right.
So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
A cradle for it.
"Yeah,"
so you can steady it
"and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?"
"Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw"
"but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that"
"Right,"
right.
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.
"I said I'm not that steady,"
it's not going to happen.
Yeah.
So we built a cradle for it
"and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,"
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
Right.
"So,"
Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?
"Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth."
You know
"Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log"
"and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"if you're looking at adding on you have,"
"Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution."
I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.
"I think that would be a ,"
Huh-uh.
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.
They could go visit them during the day.
What?
Yeah
"that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children."
"But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit."
Yes
I do.
"Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too."
"You know, go on and pay a lump sum"
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.
"But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay."
"But if you pay out less, then you lose that money."
Um.
"I don't like that part,"
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.
"Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important."
"And then we got that cafeteria plan,"
do you have that?
No.
No.
I don't know what it's about .
"You can, uh,"
"well you,"
"let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance."
It takes it out of your salary before taxes.
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
yeah
"Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, we were talking about child care"
and he asked me if I had any kids.
He was about forty or fifty years old
"and I said no, I'm just twenty,"
"He was ancient,"
yeah.
"and I said no, I'm just twenty-three,  you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children"
Uh-huh.
"but the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your life."
"And I just,"
"I,"
"my, my mind just went,"
You didn't know what you're going to be missing.
"I went, what. You know,"
"because it it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children,"
I don't have any either
"and I've been a married for eleven years,"
so.
"Yeah,"
"and I, it just, you know,"
"I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like,  just because, I'm not sure if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my career."
"Yeah,"
"when it's time,"
uh-huh.
"I'm trying to go somewhere, and,  and get there quick and then worry about, you know, because right now, in my career I'm, I'm really starting out,"
"Yeah,"
"you want to establish,"
and it's going to take me a while to move up.
"Uh-huh,"
"And I don't need anything kind of holding me back, um."
"It's a good general education for a, a bachelor's degree."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And obviously, and obviously it's where they don't have a, any post graduate program there,"
"but you get a, an excellent, wide, uh, basis of topics."
"You know, you get a good broad education out of it."
Uh-huh.
"You don't, they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors, but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh,"
"How do you feel about,"
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college.
"How does that, uh,"
"how do you feel that is for someone at, at that phase in their life?"
"Well, the for some people, it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline, need a little reining in at that, that stage in their life."
"Uh, other people,"
"it, uh, it's, uh, suffocating,"
Uh-huh.
"you know, you kind of choke on it"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"uh, it, it depends on the person, on the individual,"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the, the cost of, how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've, you've got a, your share of student loans that, uh, you're probably going to be paying off or have been"
"or,"
"I was a W F for several years,"
and it just never seems to improve.
"It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
It's really a shame.
"Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll."
Oh.
"And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,"
"So, how do you feel about the metric system?"
"Oh, I like it."
"I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile."
"And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters,"
I was trying to build a shed
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
"and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ..."
"Yeah,"
"and it's,"
I forget how many millimeters.
So you used the metric?
"Well, no."
"What we did was wind up using,"
"and you just go, you just go down"
"and, and you get out the, the, so many inches"
"and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward"
"but had it been millimeters, you could have done."
"I think what's interesting,"
"the way engineering people do is they,"
"they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?
Exactly.
"And, then her little brother's only two years behind"
Exactly.
"and he says, well, I don't know,"
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.
"And I said, that's great."
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
"That's right,"
That's right
"Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff"
"and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,"
"but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go."
"I have, you know, all,"
this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've
"always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms"
"and so I've never had the, the big benefit package."
"So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know."
"It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered."
"So, I've been real pleased."
"Well, that's fantastic,"
Yeah.
"and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors."
Think so?
"Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits"
Uh-huh.
"but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
and you can pick what you want
"and, yeah."
now it's up to you
"it's menu selection, so, to speak."
"and they cut each others throats until they're, they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat."
"And, uh, well, of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,"
that's government controlled.
"But, uh,"
"Well, I, I think another thing too that, um, I've had a little contacted with, uh,"
"in regard to taxes let's say that, uh, you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, you know, says, hey, we're not going to allow that."
"Well, I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you, you will not only payback that that you wrote off"
but you will at least double that amount
"and,"
"Oh, by the time you get through with the, uh the penalties."
Yes.
"And that's, to me there's something wrong there, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I can see paying the interest and some small penalty"
but they really stick it to you big time.
"Uh, I agree."
"I think the I R S is, uh, just too powerful."
There should be some sort of a control on it.
And they should be a little more humane.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
"Uh, the, uh, typical bureaucratic, I guess. That's, that's one of my pet peeves."
"I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the, the budget."
Uh-huh.
Very simple.
"Give, uh, uh, uh, government employees the average number of, uh, holidays as the, uh, private industry."
Yeah.
"I mean, you think about it now,"
"they, they get about sixteen holidays a year."
That's a lot.
It sure is.
"And I think here at TI we get, what is it nine or ten?"
And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
"And that's the way to do it, too."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you"
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.
Yeah.
"And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?"
"Preparing it,"
right.
"Oh, it sure does."
"Well,"
"Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,"
"Uh, go ahead,"
tell me what you think.
Do we get our money's worth?
"Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes."
"Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things."
"Yeah,"
did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
"No,"
I did not.
"I,"
"Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need."
"And, uh, it's staggering."
"Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you?"
"Uh, this,"
"I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady,"
"but this, I heard this on a Christian program"
"and it was, uh, about the N E A"
"and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,"
"and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money."
I saw it three times.
Did you.
"I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background."
"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older"
"and, uh, he's not, you know,"
"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him"
"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,"
Yes.
"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth"
"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers."
That was neat.
Uh-huh.
"Well that's tremendous,"
"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family."
"Yeah,"
a lot.
And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
Uh-huh.
"No question,"
"he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that."
He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.
Uh-huh
"And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it"
"but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN."
"I mean he certainly didn't,"
"he only saw it one time,"
"and he didn't go back for more,"
"but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it"
"and, and,"
Well he at least saw it one time
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease"
Uh-huh.
so she doesn't remember anybody
Right.
"and, uh, she remembers things,"
but they are things back whenever she was real young
Right.
"and so, with,"
she was living by herself
"but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her"
Uh-huh.
and it's creating a lot of problems.
"Right,"
especially for your uncle I bet.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.
Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
"In Dallas,"
"uh, yeah."
"I've, I've heard of several things"
"and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,"
"but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up."
Right.
So they are pretty limited.
Right.
"Oh, another interesting thing,"
"another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities."
Oh really.
Uh-huh.
"I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be."
"Uh-huh,"
"I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean."
Yeah.
"I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,"
"but I, I, uh, you know,"
"Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,"
"but, you know, up here we have Kodak"
Right.
and that's the worst polluter.
"They put, uh, uh,"
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
I guess so.
"Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras"
"and they, they make film here"
and they're the worst offender
"but it's, you know, it's under so much control."
"You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them"
but that's really getting under control now.
Right.
"I, you know, I don't know in air what they do."
"Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about."
"Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,"
"my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas"
"and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there"
"and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air."
"I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,"
"there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad."
"Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know"
"and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,"
but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
Uh-huh ery faint.
Right.
"and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off"
Uh-huh.
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
Right
"to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities."
Right.
"Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas."
"Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports."
Right.
Right.
"But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,"
That's true.
You can't play those things.
"Yeah,"
you can't do it.
"But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times."
"Well, that's true."
"I guess, you know, you were talking about your,"
"was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
And they love to recollect.
"I mean they just, you know,"
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory.
"it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>."
"Oh absolutely,"
"yeah,"
just muggy.
"So, yes"
"I think,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
Our most pollute substance down here is just water.
"But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place."
Yeah
"it,"
"You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those"
"and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around."
"Oh, yeah."
"I, you know, I was in Boston once"
"and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee."
"Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing"
Absolutely.
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.
"I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,"
I think that's biggest problem
"because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city."
Right.
"And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really."
"Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help"
but if you have nowhere to do anything.
"That's, that's very true."
"Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere."
"But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,"
"you've got that,"
and you got the cars.
"Yeah,"
that's the exact opposite.
"We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up."
We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work
"and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together"
"and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that."
Yeah.
I we didn't know a thing about any of that
"and so,  It's, it looked very hard to do"
My wife wishes I hadn't done that.
"so,"
"we figured well just,"
I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
"So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living."
"But,"
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'
Probably so
"and I, we'd never done it"
so we just left it alone.
"But that's,"
"I guess, I'm only twenty-one"
"so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much."
"So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents"
so.
"Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage"
"or was it stuff that was already, uh, enclosed?"
It was brand new.
Brand new .
We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
"so it was,"
"and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?"
"Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know."
"Well, that's nice comfortable stuff."
Yes.
"Open shirt, open at the neck, you know, no tie."
Wow.
"And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis."
Wow.
That's nice.
"Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?"
Well actually right now I'm a full time college student
"so my dress code is very, very (( ))."
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
I usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime.
"But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper."
Uh-huh.
"And that's so,"
"generally then I dress, you know, nicer."
"Usually nice summer slacks or more, sometimes skirts, stuff like that."
"So, then it's still, you know, the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of office"
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
Yes.
so.
"Yeah,"
"well I, uh, I just recently applied for a different job in the company here"
and so I decided well I'd wear a suit.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And it, it was very interesting,"
"uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits."
"Uh, most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual, almost the same clothes that, that you'd wear to school."
Wow.
That must be nice atmosphere then.
and I think that's wrong.
"I,"
I agree
"and, and, uh, I, I also think we extend too much help to other, uh, countries"
we need enough help here in this country.
That's right.
They're still people starving people here *They're There're
why should we help starving people somewhere else.
Yeah.
And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.
Absolutely.
"Now I can't wait for, uh,"
"I, I could just picture what's going to happen here in the not to distant future."
"We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh, uh-huh, the, the, the big, war over there in the Mideast."
The war.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, so many billions of dollars here and there and everything"
"and, uh, the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland"
"and say, well, just forget it."
Yeah.
And I think that's a mistake.
"Oh, definitely."
"Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away."
"Well, another thing now they keep decontrolling different things."
"First, it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association, and whatnot."
We know what trouble they got into
Exactly.
"And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were, uh, controlled and, and, uh, Transcontinental or, um, um, Interstate, uh, Trucking."
"I mean, as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket."
Yeah.
Prices went sky high.
"Then, in, in the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive"
so I guess we better get off.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
It was good talking to you.
Alright.
Bye-bye now.
Bye.
"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all."
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something"
"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything."
"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something"
"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,"
"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else."
"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,"
and he'll do it.
"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,"
"but he has changed, um, the brakes"
and he has done all of the tune-ups
and the like that
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.
I was really impressed with that
"We had to have it to get the car inspected,"
it wouldn't pass inspection
"and, and so, he priced around"
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did"
"and then, he did it"
"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,"
"what, uh, what's your experience been like?"
"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars."
"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette"
Yeah.
"but,"
"Catches you off guard, doesn't it?"
"Yes,"
"yes,"
"some of them, some of them do"
"and some of them don't,"
"but, uh, this one, uh,"
I was trying to remember back.
"It seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state."
I didn't think they were either.
I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I, I guess,"
"and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh, that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever."
Changes.
Uh-huh.
"I,"
"yeah,"
"but, I, yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that."
"I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system."
"That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever."
Exactly.
Exactly.
They don't make mistakes.
That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive
Right.
and they were not.
"And I haven't heard of any,"
now I'm not in personnel or anything.
Yeah.
"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not."
"In other words, there's very few mistakes,"
"and that, of course, has got to be critical."
"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,"
"it's got to be with a very, very good agency."
You don't just have some local group do it.
It's got to be a highly qualified agency.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
not just some doctor's office somewhere.
"No,"
you don't want to do that.
It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.
And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.
"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing."
"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course."
"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,"
"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us."
Oh really.
Yeah.
"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,"
or do they fire them right away.
"Oh, no."
They're not fired.
"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program."
"After this victory the whole Italian Kingdom lied on the mercy of the Hungarians. With no Italian army to oppose them, the Hungarians decided to spend the mild winter in Italy, continuing to attack monasteries, castles and cities, trying to conquer them, like they did before they had started to be chased by Berengar's army."
"On 13 December 899 they attacked Vercelli, where the bishop of Vercelli and archchancellor of the Carolingian Empire, Liutward, trying to escape them, taking with him his treasures, accidentally stumbled upon them, so he was killed and his treasures taken away. On 26 January 900 they conquered Modena, and two days later the Abbey of Nonantola, where they burned the monastery and the church, and killed monks."
"In the meantime, on 8 December 899, emperor Arnulf died in Regensburg, so the alliance between East Francia and the Principality of Hungary lost its validity. The Hungarian envoys sent from the new home of the Hungarians, the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, to negotiate the renewal of the alliance, were seen as spies by the guardian and councillor of the new king, the 6 year old Louis the Child, Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz and his advisers, and sent home, having achieved nothing. This started a state of war between the two political communities, so the Principality of Hungary needed the Hungarian army from Italy, which, because they became an important task in the conquest of Pannonia, which was planned by the Hungarians. They had to attack the Bavarian province from South West in the same time when another Hungarian army attacked it from East."
"Before the Hungarians left Italy, in the spring of 900, they concluded peace with Berengar, who gave them in exchange for they departure hostages, and money for the peace. After this defeat, or at the latest from 904, Berengar started to pay them tribute regularly, and until his death in 924, and in exchange the Hungarians helped him against every enemies that he had. As Liuprand writes, the Hungarians became Berengar's friends. It seems that, in time, some of the Hungarian leaders became his personal friends."
"On their way back home, the Hungarians accomplished a military performance, which was never even tried by a land army in the history. Having no ships, boats or any kind of water crafts, on 29 June 900, they ""embarked"" on a sea campaign against Venice. As ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon writes that with their horses and ""leather ships"" to attack first the cities from the coast, then also the city of Venice itself. The ""leather ship"" here refer to an animal skin (goat, sheep, maybe cow) tied up to form something like a huge bota bag, filled with air, tied on their horses sides, which helped the warrior and his horse to float, with which the Hungarians and the warriors of other nomadic societies usually used to cross rivers. They first attacked and burned the coastal towns like Equilio, Cittanova, Fine, Capo d'Argine, then tying the filled animal skins to their horses, they crossed the waters of the Lagoon of Venice, and sacked the island town of Chioggia, which was a part of the Dogado (homeland of the Republic of Venice). Then on the day of the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (29 June), on their ""leather ships"", they tried to enter Rialto and Malamocco, but before they reached the islands, on the place called Albiola the doge of Venice Pietro Tribuno met them with the Venetian war fleet, forcing them to retreat. Although they lost this unusual sea battle, the Hungarians achieved something what was never done by a land army: attacking islands lying in the sea. And although the attack from 29 June was unsuccessful, they succeeded in the attack on the island of Chioggia. This attack was not a violation of the agreement with Berengar, because at that time Venice was not part of the Italian kingdom, but was an autonomous republic under Byzantine influence."
"Historians disagree about the route taken by which the army returned to the Hungarian lands. On one hand György Szabados believes that the Hungarian army turned back home from Italy without entering Pannonia, avoiding it from the south, because in his opinion they were exhausted of continuous fighting in Italy in the last year, and were loaded up with plunders, so they would not be capable to accomplish such an important mission. The same opinion had György Györffy too in 1974."
"On the other hand, Gyula Kristó and István Bóna think that the Hungarian army returning from Italy took part in the conquest of Pannonia, but in different ways. Kristó believes that the returning Hungarian army had the task only to plunder the land, weakening the capability of the inhabitants to withstand the final attack, then crossed the Danube, turning home, and after that two new Hungarian armies, coming from East accomplished the occupation. Bóna believes that the returning Hungarian army played an active role in the conquest of Pannonia, coming from the southwest, when other armies coming from east, from the Eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, crossed the Danube, attacking it from the north and east. He thinks that the Hungarian army came back from Italy because they received an order from home to come help in the conquering of Pannonia, accomplishing it with an encircling movement."

He is worshiped in the month of Bhadon especially on the ninth day of that month. Gugga is meant to protect against snake bites and he is venerated in shrines known as marris. The shrines do not conform to any religion and can range from antholes to structures that resemble a Sikh Gurdwara or a Mosque. When worshipping Gugga, people bring noodles as offerings and also leave them in places where snakes reside. People perform a devotional dance while dancing on the legendary songs of bravery sung in his praise."

= = = Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum = = =
"Khnumhotep (pronunciation: xaˈnaːmaw-ˈħatpew) and Niankhkhnum (pronunciation: nij-daˌnax-xaˈnaːmaw) were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the Manicurists in the Palace of King Nyuserre Ini, sixth pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as ""royal confidants"" in their joint tomb. They are notable for their unusual depiction in Egyptian records, often interpreted as the first recorded same-sex couple, a claim that has met considerable debate."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded same-sex couple in ancient history. The assumed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing. Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were ""Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King"" (see sections Titularies, Banquents and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw-khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset."
"Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes."
"Egyptian records note Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum as the heads manicurists for the royal family, but they may have held a number of different official titles and duties"
"On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the ""m-r pr Sna"" ""overseer of the magazines"" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms"
"Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress,"" responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, ""jrw Snj"" "" hairdressers, who kept him shaven, and an ""m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt"" ""overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners."" The post of ""Xkrt nswt"" ""adorner of the king"" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt. Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep."
"How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier, and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as ""jr ant pr aA"" ""palace manicurists,"" quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger. A door jamb, besides ""TAtj"" ""vizier,"" displays the title ""HAt-a"" ""one whose arm is in front,"" a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the ""m-r"" and ""jrj"" titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. The ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress"" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of ""jrj-pat"" ""hereditary prince,"" another of Allen's honorifics."
"The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist Ahmed Moussa in the necropolis at Saqqara, Egypt in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King Unas. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both theophorics to the creator-god Khnum) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means ""life belongs to Khnum"" and Khnumhotep means ""Khnum is satisfied;"""
"The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under Nyuserre or Menkauhor. No human remains were discovered inside. It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources."
"In a banquet scene, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical Egyptian art, surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs."
"Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall. For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows:"

"Project Boreas was a study conducted between 2003 and 2006 by the British Interplanetary Society to design a station on the Planum Boreum at the Martian North Pole. The project was international, involving over 25 scientists and engineers, co-ordinated by Charles S. Cockell. Pole Station was designed to operate for three summers and two polar winters. Amongst a diversity of scientific objectives the station occupants were to retrieve a deep core from within the Martian polar ice cap and search for water and habitable conditions deep in the polar ice cap. Expeditions were planned to numerous locations across the Martian north polar cap, including the Chasma Boreale and the polar layered terrains. The study involved wide-ranging investigations of the scientific priorities for a human presence at the Martian polar ice caps through to detailed architectural and design studies for the station. Studies were undertaken on mobility and communications and psycho-social issues for long-term operation at the Martian polar station."
"Project Boreas was named for the Greek god of the North Wind. Concepts for polar bases had been discussed in earlier papers The station was designed with the assumption that it would be occupied by 10 people. Although the station could be constructed at any time, the study used a timeframe of 2037 to 2042 to provide a backdrop for the design. It is likely that in the coming decades robots will explore the Martian polar caps, which were first observed by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Cassini in 1666. Project Boreas considered long-term human polar exploration on Mars."
"The crew of the station were envisaged to carry out diverse scientific studies in geology, geophysics, climatology and astrobiology. One particular advantage of humans was perceived to be their ability to run a laboratory in which complex and analytical tasks can be undertaken in polar science and exploration. The design study considered that the retrieval of a core into the polar ice cap would be one of the primary objectives of Pole Station. The core would be used to study past geological and climatological changes, including dating past Martian dust storms. The core would also be used to investigate the nature of the polar layered terrains. It would be used to study whether the ice caps contained a record of organics on Mars, to search for habitats in the ice and to study questions on the past and present habitability of Martian polar ices. The occupants also had diverse climatology objectives to undertake. The study considered Martian polar astronomy to be a potentially useful additional activity for the station crew members."
During the 1173 sol-stay on the Martian surface the crew would carry out a number of expeditions across the polar ice cap. Expeditions to the Chasma Boreale and along the polar spiral valleys were considered in detail. The study also considered the possibility of exploratory mid-winter expeditions across the polar ice cap. These expeditions would be supported by pressurised and unpressurised rovers. Trafficability issues of trans-polar expeditions were considered.
"The study carried out a trade off analysis of power, thermal control and other parameters to provide a basis for the architectural design. The station would be constructed from six linked modules of 3.5 m diameter with a smaller cache module. The modules included a galley area, science and human factors laboratories, EVA preparation area and personal quarters. The station would have a ‘garden’ area to provide some fresh food and for psychological relief. The station would be supported by nuclear power and a hybrid physico-chemical and biological life support system. Provision for in-situ resource use (ISRU) from the Martian polar regions was studied, particular emphasis being placed on the availability of water from the polar ices. The station would support a separate small drilling encampment nearby and would be surrounded by radiative panels which would sublime the 2 m of carbon dioxide snow estimated to fall at Pole Station during the winter, allowing for year-round operations."
"Project Boreas considered the use of bioinspired robots to support Pole Station. ‘Arctic fox’, ‘Arctic hare’, ‘snow bunting’ (a flying robot) and ‘lemmings’ would support science and exploration objectives from Pole Station by enabling remotely controlled data collection at many spatial scales either from the rovers or from the station. The design study investigated communications for Pole Station and satellite requirements for sustaining base to field communications. The unique psycho-social issues associated with the long and permanently dark Martian polar winter were addressed. Medical requirements for long-term operation at the Martian polar ice caps were investigated in addition to the nutrition requirements, which were used to constrain the life support system design."

Her most memorable roles were as Balraj Sahni's wife in the 1965 film ""Waqt"" and Kajol's grandmother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995)."
Achala Sachdev was born on 3 May 1920 in Peshawar.
"Achala worked for All India Radio, Lahore before the partition of India, and then at Delhi All India Radio. Achala made her film debut with ""Fashionable Wife"" (1938), and acted in over 130 Hindi films. She has acted in many Yash Raj Films, starting with Yash Chopra's first production """" (1973) and films such as ""Chandni"" (1989) and ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995).

However, her most noted role remains as Balraj Sahani's wife in ""Waqt"" (1965), wherein the hit song ""Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen"" was picturised on her."
"Achala became a resident of Pune after marrying Clifford Douglas Peters, who had a factory in Pune's Bhosari industrial estate, named Morris Electronics, producing small electronics parts such as diodes. The factory was later sold to the Piramal Group. In an almost filmy turn, Sachdev was introduced to Peters by Yash Chopra on the sets of a film in Mumbai. Peter's first wife had died by then and Sachdev herself was a divorcee. They married. Peters, a mechanical engineer, had a factory in Bhosari and the couple lived in a bungalow in the same area for some time before shifting to Hadapsar. After Peters died, Achala lived alone. Five years before her death, she gave away her flat in Pune to the Janseva Foundation, a charitable organization, on the condition that they should take care of her as long as she lived."

"The Scots Confession (also called the Scots Confession of 1560) is a Confession of Faith written in 1560 by six leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. The was the first subordinate standard for the Protestant church in Scotland. Along with the Book of Discipline and the Book of Common Order, this is considered to be a formational document for the Church of Scotland during the time."
"In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland agreed to reform the religion of the country. To enable them to decide what the Reformed Faith was to be, they set John Knox as the superintendent over John Winram, John Spottiswoode, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row, to prepare a Confession of Faith. This they did in four days. The 25 Chapters of the Confession spell out a contemporary statement of the Christian faith as understood by the followers of John Calvin during his lifetime. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox."
"While the Parliament approved the Confession on 27 August 1560, acting outside the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh to do so, Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, refused to agree, and the Confession was not approved by the monarch until 1567, after Mary's overthrow. It remained the Confession of the Church of Scotland until it was superseded by the Westminster Confession of Faith on 27 August 1647. However, the confession itself begins by stating that the Parliament ""ratifeit and apprevit [the confession] as wholesome and sound doctrine grounded upon the infallible truth of God's word""; thus, though changes within societies may have diminished its relevance, believers hold that the authority of its statements is rooted not in parliamentary approval but in, as it says, ""the infallible truth of God's word"". In 1967, it was included in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s ""Book of Confessions ""alongside various other confessional standards, and remains in the current Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s ""Book of Confessions""."

"Ashwell was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1916. After high school, he went to college to further his education. He attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his B.A.in 1938 and M.S. in 1941. He then went to Columbia University in New York, which was closer to his hometown, to spend two years doing research. In 1950, Ashwell joined the National Institute of Arthirtis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases. This Institute had grown and later split into two institutes, which are the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Ashwell worked at the latter as an emeritus scientist after his retirement."
"Ashwell’s goal as a researcher was to devise a labeling serum glycoproteins in order to study the role of ceruloplasmin in Wilson disease. With another researcher named Anatol G. Morell, he worked to propose that membrane lectins remove senescent circulating glycoproteins, and discovered one of the earliest known carbohydrate receptors. They were able to devise a labeling procedure which allowed them to remove enzymes of the glycoproteins' sialic acid residue. By completing this process, they were able to incorporate other substances into the protein. In 1974, Ashwell and Morell happened to discover that a certain receptor in a human’s liver is able to recognize a specific glycoprotein called asialoglycoprotein. Ashwell explained that he was not specifically looking for the asialoglycoprotein when he found it."

= = = Gogaji = = =
"Gogaji (also known as Goga, Jahar Veer Gogga, Gugga, Gugga Pir, Gugga Jaharpir, Gugga Chohan, Gugga Rana, Gugga Bir and Raja Mandlik) is a folk deity, worshipped in the northern states of India especially in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab region, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Gujarat. He is a warrior-hero of the region, venerated as a saint and a 'snake-god'."
"Although there are references to him in the folklore of Rajasthan, little historical knowledge of Gugga exists other than that he ruled the small kingdom of Dadrewa (in present day Rajasthan) and was a contemporary of Prithviraj Chauhan."
"According to legend, Goga was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who gave 'Gugal' fruit to Goga's mother Bachhal which was used to name him. Another belief is that he was called Goga because of his remarkable service to cows(Gou in Sanskrit)."
"Goga had a kingdom called Bagad Dedga near Ganganagar that spanned over to Hansi near Hisar in Haryana and included territory up to the river Sutlej in Punjab. It is believed that Goga lived during the 12th Century AD In the past, the river Sutlej flowed through the district of Bathinda in present-day Punjab in India. The capital was at Dadrewa near Ganganagar."
"Goga () (Rajasthani: (Gugo) गुग्गो) was born in c. 900 AD to queen Bachchal (the daughter of a Rajput ruler, Kanwarpala who in 1173 AD ruled over Sirsa in present-day Haryana) and king Zewar in Dadrewa of the Chauhan Clan in the Churu district of Rajasthan. The earliest parts of Goga's life were spent in the village of Dadrewa, situated on Hissar—Bikaner highway in Sadulpur tehsil of Churu district in Rajasthan. According to other legends, his father was Vachha Chauhan, the Raja of Jangal Desh, which stretched from the Sutlej to Haryana."
"When Bachal was worshipping Gorakhnath, her twin-sister decided to usurp the blessings from the Gorakhnath. In the middle of the night, she wore her sister's clothes and deceived Gorakhnath into giving her the blessing fruit. When Bachal came to know about it, she rushed to Gorakhnath and said that she had not received anything. To this, Gorakhnath replied that he had already given his blessings and said that her sister was attempting to deceive her. After repeated requests by Bachal, Gorakhnath relented and gave her two Gugal candies. She distributed these candies to ladies having no child, including the 'blue mare' who was pregnant at that time. When the Guru gave the blessing to Bachal, he foretold that her son would become very powerful and would rule over the other two sons of their aunt, Kachal."
Goga was married to Shreeyal Roz who was daughter of Tandul Nagari's King Sindha Singh.
Another story is that Arjan and Sarjan were against Goga and was a part of conspiracy with king Anangpal Tomar of Delhi. King Anganpal attacked bagad region with Arjan and Sarjan. Both of them were killed by Goga. Goga spared the king after his miserere. In a quarrel about land he killed his two brothers on which account he drew upon himself the anger of his mother.
"The cult of Goga falls within folk religion and therefore his followers include people from all faiths. Goga is popular as a Devta who protects his followers from snakes and other evils. He has been deified as a snake demigod and is a prominent figure among those who follow the Nāga cult in what is now Rajasthan and since the seventeenth century has been worshipped in the Western Himalayas also, possibly as a consequence of migration there from Rajasthan."
"He is particularly popular among those engaged in agrarian pursuits, for whom the fear of snakebite is common. Although a Hindu, he has many Muslim devotees and is chiefly considered to be a saint (""pir"") who had the power to cure the effects of poison (""jahar"")."
"He was reputed to be a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath. According to Muslim oral tradition prevalent in Punjab, he learnt the way of entering and leaving solid earth by a Muslim Pir Hazi Rattan of Bathinda. Goga is also believed to have lived for some time in Bathinda."
"The cult is prevalent in Rajasthan and other states of northern India, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the north western districts of Uttar Pradesh. His followers can also be found in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh."
"His shrine, referred as medi (shortened colloquial term for Samādhi), consists of a one-room building with a minaret on each corner and a Hindu grave inside, marked by a Nishan (a symbol or sign), which is made up of a long bamboo with peacock plumes, a coconut, some colored threads and some handpankhas with a blue flag on the top."
"Worship of Goga starts in Bhaadra month of Hindu calendar. On the 9th of Bhadra, the people worship his symbol, a black snake painted on a wall. Worshippers take a fly-flap, known as chhari, round the village. Devotees pay their respect to it and offer churma. The Savayians sing devotional songs known as ‘Pir ke Solle’ in his honour to the accompaniment of deroos. Beating of deroos is the exclusive privilege of the Savayian community; others may sing, dance or offer charhawa. It is believed that the spirit of Gugga temporarily takes abode in the devotee dancer who lashes himself with a bunch of iron chains. People also open their rakhis on this day(bhadra krishna paksh navmi) and offer them to him. They also offer sweet puri (a type of sweet chappati) and other sweets and take his blessing."
"Grand fairs are held at samadhi sathal Gogamedi. Gogamedi is 359 km from Jaipur, in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. It is believed that Goga went into samādhi at Gogamedi. Thousands of devotees gather to pay homage at this memorial annually in the month of Bhadrapada during the Goga fair, which lasts for 3 days. The fair is held from the ninth day of the dark half of Bhadrapada (Goga Navami) to the eleventh day of the dark half of the same month. People sing and dance to the beats of drums"
"with multicoloured flags called ""nishans"" in their hands. The songs and bhajans on the life history of Gogaji are recited accompanied by music played with traditional instruments like Damru, Chimta, etc. At his birthplace Dadrewa, the fair goes on over a month. Devotees from far eastern places of Dadrewa start arriving from the beginning of the auspicious month of Bhaadra. These devotees are commonly known as purbia (those who belong to east). It is a common sight to see people with snakes lying around their necks. According to a folklore in and around his birthplace Dadrewa it is believed that if someone picks up even a stick from johra (a barren land which has a sacred pond in Dadrewa), it would turn into a snake. Devotees of Gogaji worship him when they get a snake bite and apply sacred ash (bhabhoot) on the bite as an immediate remedy."
"In Thaneek Pura, Himachal Pradesh, a very large scale festival and fair is organized on Gugga Navami. The tale of Gugga Ji is recited, from Raksha Bandhan to Gugga Naumi, by the followers who visit every house in the region. These followers while singing the tales of Gugga Ji carry a Chhat (a wooden umbrella) and people offer them grains and other stuff. They bring all the collected offerings to the temple and then the grand festival of Gugga Navami is celebrated for three days. Apart from various pujas and rituals, the wrestling competition (Mall or Dangal) is organized for three days where participants from all over the region compete. The annual three-day fair is also a part of these festivities where people come and enjoy great food, and shop for decorative items, handicrafts, clothes, cosmetics, household goods, and toys for children."
"Goga is known as Gugga in the Punjab who has a significant following. Many Punjabi villages have a shrine dedicated to Gugga. A fair is organised annually in the village of Chhapar and is known as the Chhapar Mela. Gugga's legacy in Punjab can be seen in towns such as Bareta Mandi, which is situated at a distance of 51 km from Mansa in Punjab. ""The town is predominantly inhabited by Chauhans who trace their origin from Gugga, ‘Lord of Snakes’. It is said that nobody has ever died here on account of snakebite because of the blessings of Gugga."""
"= = = Yeshivah Centre, Sydney = = ="
"The Yeshiva College, also known as the Harry O. Triguboff Centre, is a Hasidic Jewish synagogue, learning centre, and library of the Chabad-Lubavitch nusach, located at 36 Flood Street, in the Sydney suburb of Bondi, New South Wales, Australia. The Centre runs various adult and child-based educational programs."
The centre was established in 1956 by Abraham Rabinovitch and others. The leaders from 1956 to 1968 were Rabbi G. Hertz and Rabbi C. E. Barzel. In 1968 the Yeshiva's board of trustees appointed Rabbi Pinchus Feldman to lead its synagogue and to assist with expanding its small ultra-orthodox Jewish day school.
"Our Big Kitchen, a charity established by Yeshiva Sydney in 2005, operates from the Yeshiva."
"In February 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard Rabbi Yossi Feldman testify, where he stated that he ""was not aware it was illegal to touch a child's genitals"". Feldman told the Commission that he did not find it necessary for victims to report sexual abuse to the police if offences took place decades prior. He proposed that the law be lenient on sexual predators who had not committed any sexual abuse for two decades if they had repented. His comments outraged the Australian Jewish community, and victims of sexual harassment called for him to stand down. Rabbi Yossi Feldman stood down from his administrative positions at the Yeshiva Centre."
"Due to their negligent handling of sex abuse in the Centre, survivor advocate, Manny Waks, placed the centre on his wall of shame."
The Royal Commission issued a case study on Yeshiva educational facilities in Sydney and Melbourne. The Commission reported that:
"The Yeshiva Gedolah Rabbinical College, like other Chabad Yeshivot Gedolot, provides education and training to young men seeking ordination as rabbis. Established in 1986 by the Yeshiva Centre, it forms part of the Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva network. Rabbi Boruch Lesches served as its Rosh Yeshiva and Mashpia for almost twenty years. He has since left Sydney, and is currently serving as the rabbi of the Chabad-Lubavitch shul in Monsey, New York, which also contains a Yeshiva that is part of the Tomchei Temimim network."
"The Yeshiva Gedolah was administered by Rabbi Yossi Feldman, a son of the Chabad Emissary for New South Wales, Head Rabbi and spiritual leader for Chabad-Lubavitch, New South Wales, Pinchus Feldman, until February 2015 when, following Rabbi Yossi Feldman's evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies labelled his views repugnant and declared him to be ""unfit to hold any position of authority or leadership in the Jewish community""."
"Yeshiva College was a Jewish day school, established by the Yeshiva Centre in 1956. From 1968 to 2003 it was headed by Rabbi Pinchus Feldman. After financial difficulty, in late 2003 the Feldman family ceded control over the school to philanthropist Meir Moss for 1. The school later rebranded as Kesser Torah. In 2007 the Yeshiva opened a new school called Cheder Chabad Lubavitch, later renamed Yeshiva College Bondi Ltd."
= = = Ayds = = =
"Ayds (pronounced as ""aids"") Reducing Plan Candy was an appetite-suppressant candy that enjoyed strong sales in the 1970s and early 1980s and was originally manufactured by The Campana Company. It was available in chocolate, chocolate mint, butterscotch, and caramel flavors, and later a peanut butter flavor was introduced. The original packaging used the phrase ""Ayds Reducing Plan vitamin and mineral Candy""; a later version used the phrase ""appetite suppressant candy"". The active ingredient was originally benzocaine, presumably to reduce the sense of taste to reduce eating, later changed in the candy (as reported by ""The New York Times"") to phenylpropanolamine."
"By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease. While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market."
The product was introduced by the Carlay Company of Chicago. A U.S. trademark was registered in 1946 claiming first use in commerce was in 1937.
"In 1944, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission objected to the claim that the product could cause the user to ""lose up to 10 pounds in 5 days, without dieting or exercising""."
"The Carlay Company later became a division of Campana Corporation of Batavia, Illinois. Then Campana bought Allied Laboratories of Kansas City in 1956. Thereafter, Campana was bought by Dow Chemical and its president, Irving Willard Crull, was president of Dow for less than six months, during which time he engineered the sale of Campana to Purex in the 1960s. He again become president of Campana while serving as a vice president of Purex, which allowed Campana to function as a separate division. Crull also relied on socialite and Hollywood friends like Bob Hope and his wife Dolores Hope, Tyrone Power and his wife Linda Christian, and others to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan Candy line. A ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine article in November 1956 reported that Crull had already recruited a number of his friends amongst socialite and Hollywood celebrities to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan weight-loss regimen."
"In 1981, Purex sold the rights to the Ayds name to Jeffrey Martin Inc. In 1987, Jeffrey Martin, Inc. and its product line (including Ayds Appetite Suppressant and Compoz Sleep Aid) were acquired by the Dep Corporation (sometimes written DEP)."
= = = Justin King (guitarist) = = =
"Justin King (born June 13, 1979) is an American musician and artist from Eugene, Oregon, recognized as a pioneering guitarist for his percussive ""tapping"" playing style which consists of a variety of influences ranging from Flamenco to Celtic music. Currently, King is running a recording studio in Brooklyn, New York called Vinegar Hill Sound as well as doing part-time war photojournalism in places like Iraq and Afghanistan."
"King comes from a family well known in the wine business under the King Estate name. King attended O'Hara Catholic School from the first grade through the eighth grade. He later attended Marist High School before attending South Eugene High School. He dropped out of high school as a sophomore and entered the San Francisco Art Institute to study painting. He began playing drums and guitar around age 14 and wrote and performed songs with his current bassist, Drew Dresman. King began to focus on acoustic guitar at age 19, and in 1999 he released his self-titled album, followed by ""Opening"" in 2000. In 2001, after traveling through Europe, Ireland and Great Britain, King recorded ""Le Bleu""—an instrumental acoustic guitar record which featured long-time friends and James West on percussion, Troy Sicotte on bass and Linh Renken on violins. Le Bleu was recorded at Peter Gabriel's ""Real World Studios"" just outside Bath, England."
"Inspired by Real World Studios, King returned to the US and began construction on his own studio ""Blackberry Hill"". The studio took about two years to complete during which time King toured the country as a solo guitarist opening for James Taylor, BB King, Diana Krall, North Mississippi All-Stars, Al Green and others. Just after building Blackberry Hill King recorded another instrumental record, ""I-XII"", with James West, renowned bassist Michael Manring and European guitarist Carlos Vamos. Shortly after that King started a band with James West (later replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee), Troy Sicotte (later replaced by Drew Dresman), and Ehren Ebbage (later replaced by Chris Plank). The band toured the country for about one year before being signed to a major label record deal with Epic Records in 2006."
"The band recorded the self-titled ""Justin King and the Apologies"" record at King's Blackberry Hill studio as well as studios in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The recording process took more than a year during which time the band continued to tour extensively throughout the nation as well as some international performances. After a large shakeup at Epic Records in which the president and the band's A&R representative left the company the band stayed on in limbo with Epic for about one more year before requesting to be let go from the label. Epic gave the master recording rights to the band and the album was released independently by the band shortly thereafter. After touring tirelessly throughout the year the band broke up around the end of 2007."
"Since the disbanding of The Apologies, King has pursued an interest in photojournalism, having spent August 2008 in Iraq embedded with the Oregon National Guard at Balad Air Base. He accompanied the US military on patrols and raids as well as medevac missions and convoys. His photos appeared on the BBC's website and his stories were featured in Oregon's mainstream news publications."
"In 2001, King released ""Le Bleu"", which was a mostly instrumental album featuring only one track with vocals (""Ashes""). It dramatically showcased his skills on acoustic instruments, and although the album was independently released, it would receive critical acclaim. However, the biggest boom to his music career was the release of live videos on the Internet. The first, and most famous, was a clip of the credits from a documentary on Jean Larrivée guitars. In it, King plays an energetic, fast-paced version of ""Phunkdified,"" which served to introduce younger, web-savvy players to King's unique playing style. His live performance of ""Knock on Wood"" at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene introduced the Doolin double-neck acoustic guitar."
"Following the release of ""Le Bleu"", King began several new projects including an electronic remix of ""Le Bleu"" by the Raging Family, and another instrumental project with Carlos Vamos and Michael Manring. His primary focus, however, was a songwriting-based album. He assembled a new band with longtime friends Ehren Ebbage (lead guitar) and Drew Desman (bass). In 2005, drummer James West and was replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee. King's endeavor in rock music also features a return to playing piano on several songs. King's latest music maintains his complex musical style despite acquiring a more mainstream sound."
"On March 20, 2007, King and his band, after a long struggle, ended their contract with Sony BMG/Epic Records. The band felt that the label took away a considerable amount of freedom in deciding how the music should sound, as well as showing little interest in King's musical ambitions. The band released a five-song EP, ""Fall/Rise"", in spring 2007 before resuming touring, which included several performances in South Korea. The band's debut album, ""Justin King and The Apologies"", was released on September 28, 2007."
"USS ""Wildcat"" was a two masted schooner of 48 tons and was part of a naval fleet, the ""West Indies Squadron"", that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the occurrence of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. She was armed with three guns and had a crew of 31. ""Wildcat"" was commanded by Lieutenant Legare' who sailed her to Washington with a dispatch regarding the disposition of the squadron and other matters concerning the war against piracy in the Caribbean. On 28 October 1824 ""Wildcat"" was lost in a gale with all hands while sailing between Cuba and Thompson's Island, West Indies. Approximately 31 drowned."
= = = Saarbahn = = =
"The Saarbahn is a regional Stadtbahn operating on the tram-train principle in the German state of the Saarland. It consists of a core line in Saarbrücken and Riegelsberg operating under tram operating procedures (BOStrab), connected to two lines that are operated under railway operating procedures (EBO), the Lebach–Völklingen railway to the north and the Saarbrücken–Sarreguemines railway in the south. ""Stadtbahn Saar GmbH"" is responsible for the infrastructure of the central section of line, while the outer tracks are operated by the national railway infrastructure companies, DB Netz AG in Germany and Réseau Ferré de France in France. ""Saarbahn GmbH"" is the train operating company for the whole system."
"The route of the new line of the Saarbahn that was opened in central Saarbrücken in 1997 is essentially line 5 of the Saarbrücken tramway, which was closed in 1965. This line ran between Rastpfuhl and Schafbrücke and was the last line of the old metre-gauge network."
", the current network operates on of route, and serves 43 stations."
"The first considerations of building a regional rail network in and around Saarbrücken began in the 1990s. The bus service in central Saarbrücken then ran at such a high density that the vehicles sometimes operated at one-minute intervals. Following the example of the Karlsruhe model, which had operated with great success since 1992, the Saarland began to plan to build a regional Stadtbahn. The core of the concept was the building of an inner-city railway line, while the outer branches would share the existing Deutsche Bahn railway infrastructure. As early as 1992, it borrowed a light rail vehicle from the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn and ran it on the Fürstenhausen–Gersweiler Bahnhof–Saarbrücken Messebahnhof route on the Rossel Valley Railway (""Rosseltalbahn""), south of the Saar."
"Before the opening of the Saarbrücken city centre line, there was a trial operation between Saarbrücken Central Station (""Hauptbahnhof"") and Hanweiler with Saarbahn vehicles. However, as it was still in the Deutsche Bahn timetable, replacing the previously locomotive-hauled trains on this section, it was operated by Deutsche Bahn. This forward operation began on 29 September 1997 and ended on 24 October 1997, the opening day of the new line through the city centre."
"On 24 October 2007, the Saarbrücken Stadtbahn celebrated its tenth train anniversary. Since inception more than 100 million passengers had been carried, almost twice as many as originally planned. Thus, it had become a great success as a model for other cities considering the establishment of a light railway."
"The core of the Saarbahn—the new line between Brebach station and Ludwigstraße—was put into operation on 24 October 1997, after just under two and a half years of construction. Since its opening, there has been a system separation point between Römerkastell and Brebach station. This is a 90-metre-long non-energised section of the overhead line, which is traversed using momentum, while the vehicle's electric system automatically switches to the other system. Saarbahn railcars coming from central Saarbrücken change from 750 volts DC to 15,000 volts AC and run via Kleinblittersdorf to Sarreguemines, Lorraine. The French section from the border station at Hanweiler has been equipped with the German electric system since 1983. The first light rail vehicle that reached Saarguemines was two-system railcar 810 of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), which ran there on 11 September 1993 during a presentation ride."
"The extension in the northerly direction took place in several stages. It was extended to Cottbuser Platz on 31 July 1999, to Siedlerheim on 13 November 2000, to Riegelsberg Süd on 24 September 2001 and to Walpershofen/Etzenhofen on 26 September 2009. Construction of the Riegelsberg Süd–Walpershofen/Etzenhofen section, required the contribution of additional costs of around €630,000 per year (an amount that was until recently disputed) from the city of Saarbrücken, the municipality of Riegelsberg and indirectly from the Saarland. Clearing work was performed on the former route of the Koller Valley Railway (Lebach–Völklingen railway) through Walpershofen and Dilsburg in January and February 2009, the railway overpass in the center of Walpershofen was renewed in 2009/10 and the reactivation of Heusweiler Markt was largely completed in the summer of 2011. This stretch of track was inaugurated on 30 October 2011."
"Although another system separation point between BOStrab and EEO was instituted at Walpershofen in 2011, the electrical system does not change there because the electric system for the Saarbahn on the Koller Valley Railway also runs at 750 volts DC."
"With the exception of a small section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen over which the Saarbahn runs in an east-west direction along the Russenweg (L 267), which had never been used by a railway, the Saarbahn follows two very different historical railway lines:"
"From Saarbrücken through the Köllertaler Wald (Köller valley forest) and Riegelsberg to Riegelsberg-Güchenbach, Saarbahn follows the course of the historical Riegelsberg tramway: an interurban tram line from St.Johann/Saarbrücken via Riegelsberg to Heusweiler, which was opened in 1907. The line broadly followed today's federal highway 268, which also continues directly from Güchenbach to Heusweiler. The line served the mines in Heusweiler-Dilsburg and Von der Heydt. The tramway was replaced by trolleybuses in 1953 and was replaced in turn by diesel-powered buses in 1964."
"After the new section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen, the Saarbahn reaches, at the Walpershofen/Etzenhofen stop, the line of the former Koller Valley Railway, over which it continues north through Walpershofen to its temporary terminus at Heusweiler Markt."
"A extension of the current line, from the current northern terminus, Heusweiler Markt, north to Lebach-Jabach opened for service on 5 October 2014. This extension will expand the Saarbahn line to cover a total of of route."
"Currently the cross-city route is operated as line S1 between Heusweiler Markt and Sarreguemines, with services every 7.5 minutes during the day on the core section between Siedlerheim and Brebach station. Originally, a five-minute interval service was planned for the central area, but this was rejected because it would have led to operational problems. On the sections using rail tracks between Brebach and Kleinblittersdorf and between Heusweiler Markt and Siedlerheim there is a 15-minute interval service and on the Kleinblittersdorf–Sarreguemines section services operate every 30 minutes only in the morning and every 60 minutes at other times."
"In the off peak hour, services operate at 15-minute intervals in the central section, every 30 minutes to Kleinblittersdorf or Siedlerheim and every 60 minutes to Sarreguemines. In the morning peak for professional and school transport and in the afternoon peak, coupled vehicles are used, otherwise single sets are operated. The Saarbahn carries approximately 40,000 passengers daily."
"Currently there are 28 Flexity Link tram-trains in use, which were manufactured by Bombardier in Vienna and Bruges. Six sets were temporarily loaned to Kassel, where they operated trial runs for RegioTram Kassel. From the timetable change in December 2009, three tram-trains were lent to the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe for use on line S9."
"A line is proposed towards Schafbrücke. Another proposal would include an extension via Burbach to Völklingen station, but this plan has been put on hold, as the effects of mining have to be remedied first. Other plans include an extension to the University, to Rotenbühl, to Alt-Saarbrücken, to Forbach and to Eschberg. , no work has been carried out on any of these proposals."

"Critical friend has its origins in critical pedagogy education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall. One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,"
"Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the University of Warwick in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the ""hostile witness"" and the ""uncritical lover"" whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept."
"This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister Peter Kilfoyle MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister Tony Blair and he chose to resign from Government, Hansard quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a ""critical friend"" of the Government."
"He was misquoted in the ""Daily Telegraph"" as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a ""candid friend"" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ""The Guardian"" newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Coventry City Council, Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,"
= = = Tamil historical novels = = =
Tamil historical novels are a genre of Tamil literature that began to appear in the mid-19th century.
"Prathaapa Mudaliaar Charithram (""The Life of Prathaapa Mudaliaar""), written in 1857 and published in 1879, was the first novel in the Tamil language. The novel does not involve historical characters or events but is set in royal times. Penned by Maayuram Vedanaayakam Pillai, it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. One can see the style of any Tamil author in this novel."
"Aabathukidamaana Apavaadham -or- Kamalaambaal Charithram is written by Rajam Iyer from Vathalakundu in the later part of the 19th century is the first Tamil novel depicting the life of living people. The author worked in Tamil daily Dinamani; he live just 26 years. Considering the period in which he lived and wrote, he created waves in emancipation of women's life, incomparable to any social reformist. In this story he conducted marriage to a Brahmin widow. Had he lived further and wrote more, the style of modern Tamil prose would have been different."
"Authors like Kalki Krishnamurthy, Akilan wrote historical novels during the Indian independence movement to instil patriotic pride in the people. Most historical novels were serialised in Tamil magazines before being published in book form. The advent of netzines has seen new web based historical writers entering the arena."

"Bateman is an organized hamlet in the southwest region of Saskatchewan, Canada, north of the Red Coat Trail. It was named after Jim Bateman, the first settler to come to the area with his family in 1908."
"Bateman was once a prosperous community, which had a peak population of more than 300 citizens in the late 1920s. In 2000, the last resident left, and many of the remaining buildings were torn down by the government of Saskatchewan."
"Upon arrival in 1908, Jim Bateman took possession of a quarter section of land on the banks of Notukeu Creek. Then in 1911, Bateman would open a post office. His daughter Lydia was sworn in as the post mistress and drove up to St. Boswells, northwest of Bateman with her father to pick up the community's first mail bag."
"During its pioneer and times of great prosperity, Bateman would have over 300 residents during the late 1920s. Bateman was also a focal point for small family grain farmers in the region. The community once boasted four grain elevators, a bank, a theatre, restaurants, two gas stations, two churches, three grocery stores, skating and curling rink, and two implement businesses. The community even had its own power plant and street light system."
"Bateman once had a school that covered grades K–12, but closed due to the consolidation of schools. In 1966, Bateman lost its grade 12 classes, and a few years after that the school would again lose grades 10 and 11, to the neighbouring town of Gravelbourg, leaving only grade nine for the high-school level, eventually being moved there as well, leaving just the elementary classes. In 1996, Bateman's school finally closed for good."
Today the once impressive brick school has been demolished due to the poor condition the building was in. All that remains of the former school is the foundation and a commemorative sign.

= = = State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 = = =
"State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 (), officially named Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas (), is an order from the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the People's Republic of China's agency charged with keeping religion under state control. Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as tulkus (reincarnated teachers)."
"Tibetan Buddhists believe lamas and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These tulkus are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as ""living Buddhas"". In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, based on the prior Religion Work for Some Questions《中共中央、国务院关于进一步做好宗教工作若干问题的通知》published in 1991, that reincarnated lamas must be approved by the Central Government."
"On August 3, 2007, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are ""illegal or invalid"". The decree states, ""It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country."" It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be ""legally-registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha."""
"Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council."
"The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law."
"The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, ""The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs""."
"The official Xinhua News Agency said the new rules are ""an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas"". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power."
"The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas ""against religious ritual and historical convention"", according to the Chinese government. The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 Panchen Lama, whose influence in Tibetan Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama. Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991."
"The Golden Urn was established by the Qing Qianlong Emperor to allow the Qing dynasty Emperor of China to determine the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in Yonghe Temple in Beijing for choosing Mongolian Jebtsundamba Khutughtu reincarnations. The 7th Panchen Lama, Palden Tenpai Nyima, used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso."
"In 1936, Golden Urn was also institutionalized in the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas《喇嘛轉世辦法》 by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government."
"Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name Qoigyijabu (Gyancain Norbu) as the 11th Panchen Lama. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the Government of Tibet in Exile. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso had named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama."
"The Khalkha Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols."
"The 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai, to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in Lhasa (who had selected a boy from Xikang) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. Guan Jiyu, the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, joined Kuomintang Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at Kumbum Monastery. The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen."
"The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be ""liberated"" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic. In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the 17-Point Agreement and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement. He was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama when they met in 1952."
"The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as ""the real 6th Dalai Lama"" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama. He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12."

"Too-Rye-Ay is the second album by Dexys Midnight Runners, released in July 1982. The album is best known for the hit single ""Come On Eileen"", which included the lyrics ""too-rye-ay"" that inspired the album's title."
"Shortly before recording this album, Dexys' bandleader Kevin Rowland had decided to add a violin section to the band's existing horn section, which had contributed strings (viola and cello) to the band's previous single, ""Liars A to E"". However, after violinists Helen O'Hara and Steve Brennan joined the band, the three members of the horn section, including Dexys' co-leader and album co-composer ""Big"" Jim Paterson, decided to leave Dexys and become an independent horn band (ultimately known as The TKO Horns). Rowland convinced them to stay with the band long enough to record the album and to perform in a kick-off concert debuting the album on BBC Radio One in June 1982."
"All the songs on the album were rearranged to add strings, which caused Dexys to re-record the 1981 singles ""Plan B"", ""Liars A to E"", and ""Soon"". During the rearrangement process, ""Soon"" was revised into the opening section of ""Plan B""; since both songs were written by Rowland and Paterson, the merged songs are credited on the album simply as ""Plan B""."
"The album's ""Come On Eileen"" became a number one hit in both the UK and the US. Dexys Midnight Runners is best known as a one hit wonder in the US (""Come On Eileen"" was also the first US single release by Dexys), but in the UK, ""Geno"" had previously reached number one, and ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" were also UK hits."
"Before ""Come On Eileen"", Dexys' only North American single was the Northern Soul classic ""Seven Days Too Long"", which Dexys' previous label EMI America had released only in Canada (with ""Geno"" as the B-side). However, on the strength of ""Come On Eileen"", ""Too-Rye-Ay"" reached number 14 in the US. Dexys' success in US was not maintained; the best performer of the band's follow-up singles in the US was ""The Celtic Soul Runners"", which peaked at number 86."
"Different releases of ""Too-Rye-Ay"" featured different versions of ""Come On Eileen"". Certain editions of the album featured a version beginning with a solo fiddle playing the first line of the folk song ""Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms"" and ending with a simple fadeout (""length: 4:07""). This version of the song is the one featured on the single release. Other editions of the album (including many of the ""re-releases"") featured a version without the violin intro and including a tag of Kevin Rowland singing ""Young Charms"" at the end, while the digital version offered by Spotify includes both front and end ""Young Charms"" tags (""length: approximately 4:32""). In addition, the most common release of the album features ""Come On Eileen"" as the final track, while the original US release features the tune as the opening track on Side 2."
"The album was re-released in 1996 on CD with 8 bonus tracks. In 2000 an enhanced edition was released with the music videos for ""Come On Eileen"" and ""Jackie Wilson Said"" as bonus material. In 2002 a US edition with bonus tracks was released. Marking its 25th Anniversary, a 2007 2-CD Deluxe Edition was released, which included the entire 14-song album kickoff performance on BBC Radio 1 that had previously been released (without ""I'll Show You"") as ""BBC Radio One Live in Concert""."

"Westside High School is the only high school of the Westside Community Schools district (also known as District 66 to local residents) of Omaha, Nebraska, United States."
"Westside has used a modular schedule since 1967. Each module, or ""mod"" (as known colloquially among WHS students), is either a 20 or 40-minute period used for classes or independent study time in an instructional materials center (IMC). This allows freedom in scheduling as classes can be 40, 60, or 80 minutes long, as needed for one-to-one, small group, large group, and laboratory instruction. Classes are taught in a similar format to many universities; students meet a large group lecture once per week and have small group recitations throughout the week. An average student has at least one or two full open mods per day, to be used for studying, interacting with teachers, eating lunch, or socializing. Juniors and seniors who have met specific requirements are eligible to apply for a pass that allows them to leave the building during open mods."
"In 1985, Westside Senior Bridget Mergens was denied the ability to create an after-school Christian Bible club. The principal at the time rejected the idea since he said a religious club violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. In addition, the club lacked a school sponsor that was required when forming a club. Mergens argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing “religious, political, philosophical, or other content” not be denied the ability to form clubs. In 1990,Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens was heard by the Supreme Court. In an 8-1 decision, the court said that since the club did not study school curriculum, it was permitted under the Equal Access Act."

= = = International Offshore Rule = = =
The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule.
"The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules."
"The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an ""IOR rating"", in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. A typical IOR 40 footer (a ""one tonner"") rated 30.55 feet."
"The IOR rule encouraged wide short boats with limited stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, combined with a high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided a significant proportion of stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard. The managers of the rule realised that this was not a suitable direction for seaworthy yachts, and heavily penalised boats with lifting keels, but not before the 1979 Fastnet race ended in disaster. Writes John Rousmaniere:"
"Apart from the girth measurements, all measurements were basically point measurements. This meant that the hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic ""bumped"" look to many boats, particularly at the point of maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing angles of heel. Low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer."
"Thomas Baxendale, of Brockton, Massachusetts, and his wife Esther Minerva purchased Amrita Island in 1893. The couple then began to build a residence on the island, including a mansion named ""Island Haven,"" along with a stone bridge; four other homes named Stonehenge, Sorrento, Castle le Mere, and Guardian; three bathing pavilions; a gazebo; a cottage; and a mausoleum that would eventually house the Baxendales and several of their beloved animals."
"The island is well known for its ties to animal welfare advocacy. Baxendale was an advocate for animal welfare, and during his time on Amrita Island, he hosted lectures on animal advocacy and donated funds to the local Animal Rescue League. Upon Esther Baxendale's death in 1927, Harvard University was given Amrita Island in the Baxendales' will. In turn, Harvard University donated the island's 21 acres to the Animal Rescue League of Boston. On a mainland parcel of land adjacent to the Island, until 2007, the Animal Rescue League operated ""a summer camp for inner city children between the ages of seven and fourteen...where they learned animal care, dog obedience, pet shows, nature study, and woodworking."""

"St. John was born in the Parish of Christ Church and attended the Christ Church Foundation School. He was professionally trained as a lawyer at the University College London. In 1959, before the island became independent from the United Kingdom, St. John joined the Barbados Labour Party, and after independence in 1966, he was elected to the Barbados House of Assembly. He served as a member of the Upper Chamber between 1971 and 1976 as a member of the Opposition party."
"St. John left the Upper House when he was re-elected to the House of Assembly in 1976, when his party under J.M.G. Adams won the election. He served in numerous cabinet positions in the 1970s including deputy prime minister, minister of trade and industry, and minister of tourism where he did his most influential work in developing the tourism industry in Barbados. When Adams died in 1985, St. John became Prime Minister. The following year he was defeated in the elections by Errol Barrow and the Democratic Labour Party."
"In 1994 when the BLP regained power, he did not return to the Cabinet and served instead as a backbencher under Owen Arthur. That same year St. John was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados."

= = = Autos sacramentales = = =
"Autos sacramentales (Spanish ""auto"", ""act"" or ""ordinance""; ""sacramental"", ""sacramental, pertaining to a sacrament"") are a form of dramatic literature which is unique to Spain, though in some respects similar in character to the old Morality plays of England."
"The ""auto sacramental"" may be defined as a dramatic representation of the mystery of the Eucharist. At least this is the definition that would apply to the ""auto"" of the time of Calderón. It does not so well fit, however, those of the preceding century, many of which were sacramental in character only because they were presented during the feast of Corpus Christi. They are usually allegorical, the characters representing, for example, Faith, Hope, Air, Sin, Death, etc. There were some indeed, in which not a single human character appeared, but personifications of the Virtues, the Vices, the Elements, etc."
"The ""auto sacramental"" was always presented in the streets in connection with the celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi. It was preceded by a solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, the houses along the route being decorated in honor of the occasion. In the procession appeared the priests bearing the Host under a splendid canopy, followed by a devout throng, in which, in Madrid, often appeared the king and his court without distinction of rank, and last of all, in beautiful cars, came the actors from the public theatres who were to take part in the performance. The procession usually halted before the house of some dignitary while the priests performed certain religious ceremonies, the multitude kneeling meanwhile as if in church. At the conclusion of these, the auto was given. These performances, and the procession as well, were given with much splendor and at great expense, being limited only by the resources of the particular town in which they took place."
"Religious exhibitions were popular with the public in Spain as early as the 13th century. These typically consisted of simple dialogue, presented at Christmas, Carnival, Good Friday, or Easter during religious festivals. As time progressed, the celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi became larger and with that came the desire for drama surrounding the feast day and honoring the Eucharist became apparent. The first ""autos"" were derived from religious material that already existed, but by the beginning of the 16th century, the first true ""auto"" ""sacramental"", meaning the theme of the play was the mystery of the Eucharist, was presented. It was ""El Auto de San Martin"", by Gil Vicente."
"During the 16th and 17th centuries these ""autos"" continued to appear, being gradually improved and elaborated until brought to their highest state of development by Calderón. He has left about seventy ""autos"", the best known of which are ""The Divine Orpheus"", a work of considerable poetic merit, ""The Devotion to the Mass"", and ""The Captivity of the Ark"". His ""autos"" were the most popular and were the only autos performed in Madrid from 1647 to 1681. These ""autos sacramentales"" produced a great effect on the people. From time immemorial, allegory of every kind had powerfully appealed to them, and these autos took a strong hold on the popular favor, coming as they did during religious festivals, with their music and their splendor, coupled with the fact that they were given at public expense and with the sanction of the Catholic church."
"Citing disrespect of the Eucharist, Charles III declared the presentation and performance of autos prohibited by royal decree in 1765."
"Gil Vicente [c.1465 – 1536/1537]: wrote in Portuguese and Spanish; considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Juan de la Encina; wrote very early ""autos"""
"Juan de la Encina [1468 – 1529]: considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Gil Vicente; in 1496 published book called ""Cancionero"" of eight églogas, the precursor for the ""auto"" ""sacramental""."
"Juan de Timoneda [c.1520 – 1583]: wrote six ""autos"", including ""La Oveja Perdida""; author of the only ""autos"" written in Catalan."
Lope de Vega [1562 –1635]: wrote around 400 autos; 42 surviving text including “The Harvest” and “The Wolf Turned Shepherd”
"José de Valdivielso [1565 – 1638]: author of the book ""Doce autos sacramentales y"" ""dos comedias divinas"", published in 1622; precursor of Calderón de la Barca in the use of allegory."
"Pedro Calderón de la Barca [1600 – 1681]: considered most prolific of the writers of ""autos""; two well-known autos are ""La cena del rey Baltaza,"" or ""Belshazzar's Feast"" and ""El gran teatro del Mundo"", or ""The Great Theater of the World"""
"One of Calderón's ""autos"" that is a popular English translation is ""Belshazzar's"" ""Feast"". It relates directly to the Eucharist, sacrilegious behavior, and punishment exacted on Belshazzar for his sinful behavior."

Primary subclass 457 visa holders are restricted to working for their sponsor and may not work (or volunteer) for any other organisation (other than associated entities as defined by the Corporations Act). In order to change employer and sponsor, the ""new employer"" must be or become an approved 457 sponsor and then lodge a 457 nomination. Once the nomination is approved, the employer obligations will shift to the new employer and the visa applicant is restricted to working for it. There is no need to apply for a new 457 visa within the validity of the visa."
"Employees must also meet minimum levels of skill and English language requirements, in addition to character and health requirements. Some trades occupations and passport holders from certain countries may be required to do a skills assessment (see the TRA website)."
It is common for 457 visa holders to apply for a permanent Australia residents visa with a view to permanently settle in Australia and become Australian citizens.
A 457 visa holder can only work in a nominated occupation for the sponsor employer. Medical practitioners and general managers must work in their nominated occupation but they can work for employers other than their sponsor or an associated entity of their sponsor. The specific occupations to which this rule applies are listed in Exemption from the requirement to work directly for the sponsor. The worker must also not have ceased employment for more than 60 consecutive days.
"The Australian Government reviewed the 457 skilled immigrant visa and made some provisions to quicken the transition to permanent residency starting on 1 July 2012. From that date, non-resident workers on the 457 skilled immigration visa are able to transition to permanent residency if they have two years with the employer who has sponsored them and if the employer provides a full-time position in the 457 visa holder's nominated occupation."
"Furthermore, the Australian government has recognised that 457 visas deserve priority in review as they are highly responsive to the needs of the market. Overseas workers will be able to work in Australia on a six-month short term work visa before they apply for a 457 visa."
"As at 30 June 2016, the size of the subclass 457 programme was 94,890 Primary visa holders in Australia."
"An audit by the Fair Work Ombudsman conducted between Sept 2013 and June 2014 found that 40% of 457 visa holders were no longer employed by a sponsor or were being paid well below the statutory minimum wage of $53,900."
"In October 2014, the Abbott government announced that it would make it easier for businesses to apply for 457 visa workers by relaxing rules for English language competency to broaden the pool of potential workers from overseas."
"With the commencement of the Japan free trade agreement in 2015, employers no longer need to offer jobs to locals or to prove that none could fill vacancies before Japanese nationals eligible for 457 visas are employed."
"In December 2014, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection released recommendations to relax 457 visa requirements. The recommendations include extending the six month short term work visa to 12 months with no obligation to apply for a 457 visa. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) has criticized this change on the grounds that it avoids the 457 visa's requirement for English language and skills tests and employers would not be required to demonstrate they had first tried to fill job vacancies with Australian workers."
"On 18 April 2017, Malcolm Turnbull announced his intention to replace the 457 visas with 2 new categories (short term and medium term) of visas."
"One of the replacement was Temporary Skill Shortage visa, or known as 482 Visa. It allows immigration It requires candidates to obtain an IELTS (English Language) exam band score of 5 or higher, or other method of showing the English level."
= = = Tourist Trap (film) = = =
"Tourist Trap is a 1979 American supernatural slasher film directed by David Schmoeller and starring Chuck Connors, Jocelyn Jones, Jon Van Ness, Robin Sherwood, and Tanya Roberts. The film follows a group of young people who stumble upon a roadside museum housing mannequins that wield supernatural powers. Schmoeller co-wrote the script with J. Larry Carroll who served as producer for the film alongside famous producer/director Charles Band."
"Eileen and her boyfriend Woody are driving through the desert. When their car gets a flat, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky, Jerry, and Molly are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody."
"Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him."
"The others find a tourist trap and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As they swim, Mr. Slausen - the owner of said tourist trap - appears holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the highway was moved away. The nude girls feel awkward in the water as he chats and they apologize for trespassing."
"Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated waxworks figures, including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists that the women should stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep, leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death."
"Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. The women are frustrated, and later leave the museum to search for Eileen. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered. Jerry tries to reach for a key but the killer telekinetically moves it from his reach."
"Molly is still outside and searching for the others. She is soon pursued by the masked man. She meets Slausen who drives her to the museum and gives her a gun while he goes inside. The masked man appears and Molly shoots, but the gun is loaded with blanks. The man removes the mask, revealing himself to be Slausen. She panics and tries to elude Slausen but is soon captured and restrained to a bed."
"Becky and Jerry escape from the basement, but get separated. Slausen appears and takes Becky to the museum. There the Old West figures begin shooting at her. Becky is killed by an Indian Chief figure who throws a knife at her, stabbing her in the back of the head. Back at the house, Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have unknowingly been turned into a mannequin. Slausen dances with the figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated. Traumatized, she kills Slausen with an axe."
"The next morning, an insane Molly is seen driving away in the jeep with the mannequin versions of her friends."
"The screenplay for ""Tourist Trap"" was written by David Schmoeller and J. Larry Carroll, the latter of whom pitched the film to producer Charles Band. Initially, Schmoeller intended for John Carpenter to direct the film, but Carroll was unsatisfied with the financial arrangements, and opted instead that Schmoeller should direct. Carroll and Schmoeller had previously pitched the film to producers Samuel Z. Arkoff and Bruce Cohn Curtis, but were unable to secure a production arrangement."
"The original screenplay did not feature the telekinetic powers; according to Carroll, the idea was proposed by Band, who insisted it be implemented into the script."
"The production did not appoint a casting director for the film, instead relying on independent talent agents to help cast the roles. According to director Schmoeller, $50,000 of the film's budget was dedicated to salary for the lead actor portraying the villain Mr. Slausen. The role was offered to several older Hollywood actors, such as Jack Palance and Gig Young, but both turned the project down. Chuck Connors, who was the production crew's third choice for the role, accepted the role."
"According to Schmoeller, each of the actors in the film aside from Connors auditioned for their parts. Jocelyn Jones was cast as the female lead, Molly, after Schmoeller had seen some of her previous performances, while Tanya Roberts was given the role of Becky. Jon Van Ness and Robin Sherwood were given the roles of Jerry and Eileen, respectively."
"""Tourist Trap"" was filmed in 24 days in Los Angeles County, California, with additional interiors shot at Rampart Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Principal photography began on March 27, 1978. A portion of the interior scenes were shot at an abandoned house located at 5255 Hollywood Boulevard which was scheduled for demolition. Schmoeller made arrangements with the contractor to postpone the demolition of the building for five days, during which time the crew shot footage. By using the abandoned location, the production saved an estimated $30,000 in set construction and soundstage fees. David Wyler, the son of William Wyler, served a second assistant director, while the director of photography was Nicholas von Sternberg, son of Josef von Sternberg."
"Production designer Robert A. Burns, who had worked on Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) and Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), handled the art direction – and the majority of the special effects – on ""Tourist Trap"", including the mannequins and their physical manipulations. To accomplish the poltergeist-like effects in the film's opening scene, the set was constructed at a rotated 90 degrees; this allowed items to be hurled by the crew from the cabinet—which was in fact anchored to the ceiling—to the floor, which appeared on camera as a wall. Other special effects were accomplished with the use of wires. For the death sequence of Tanya Roberts's character, for example, a block of wood was taped behind Roberts's hair; a knife attached to a wire was hurled at the back of her head, which stuck into the wooden block."
"Schmoeller recalled the filming process as being a ""learning"" experience as he was a first-time director; he stated in a 2014 interview that he learned a significant amount of ""how to work with actors"" from actress Jones."
"Italian composer Pino Donaggio was in town working on Joe Dante's ""Piranha"" (1978) at the time that David Schmoeller was filming ""Tourist Trap"". Since Donaggio spoke Spanish – as did Schmoeller – the director was able to convince the composer to score the music for ""Tourist Trap"". The two would have subsequent collaborations, including ""Crawlspace"" (1986)."
"According to the American Film Institute Catalog, the film premiered in Los Angeles, California on March 14, 1979. Despite its depictions of violence and macabre images, the Motion Picture Association of America awarded the film a PG rating. Because of its rating, the film was able to receive significant broadcasting on syndicated television in the years following its theatrical release."
"From contemporary reviews, ""Variety"" wrote, ""Although pic has some appropriately menacing music and occasionally employs some decent special effects, the plot is too loaded with cliches, from the concept to individual bits of dialog to be taken seriously and not silly enough to be regarded as delightfully bad."" Charles Champlin of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that the film ""has some moments of effectiveness, but even the hard-line shiverists are likely to feel it's a long time between shrieks."" Tim Pulleine of the ""Monthly Film Bulletin"" called the film a ""wholly unimaginative exercise in low-budget horror plunders ""Psycho"" for its central plot gimmick in a fashion even more hamfisted than its is bare-faced."" and that ""Nothing much is made of the potentially sinister import of the wax dummies, by comparison with whom the human performers also fail to come off too well"""
"From retrospective reviews, Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of four stars, stating that although the film had a couple of genuine scares, it was a ""mostly boring thriller""."
"Author Stephen King, in his book ""Danse Macabre"" (1981), praised the film as an obscure classic, noting that the film ""wields an eerie spooky power, as wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort."""
"Jason Buchanan from AllMovie praised the film, calling it ""one of the most underappreciated low-budget horror films of the 1970s"". In his review on the film, Buchanan commended the film's atmosphere, score, Conners' performance, and unsettling use of sound and imagery; comparing it to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". ""TV Guide"" awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it a ""bizarre, eerie shocker."""
"The film was satirized by RiffTrax on November 21, 2012."
"The film was released on DVD by Cult Video on July 20, 1998. It was re-released on DVD by Wizard Entertainment on March 19, 2013. Full Moon Features released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on May 20, 2014. The Full Moon Blu-ray release features a truncated version of the film; though the film's violent scenes remain intact, minor plot points are absent from this cut of the film."

"A makeup brush is a tool with bristles, used for the application of makeup or face painting. The bristles may be made out of natural or synthetic materials, while the handle is usually made out of plastic or wood. When cosmetics are applied using the appropriate brush, they blend better into the skin."
"There is a large variety of shapes and sizes of makeup brushes, depending on the face area where makeup will be applied, the cosmetic product and the wanted result. For example, the shape of the brush tip can be chiseled, straight, angular, round, flat or tapered."
Makeup application can alter due to the materials used to create a brush. The bristles of a makeup brush can either be synthetic or natural. The brush itself is important to the application of makeup as it can densely pack on product or loosely pack on product.
"Synthetic bristles are the most common material used in makeup brushes. These brushes are widely found in drugstores and makeup-specific stores. The bristles are made out of plastic, nylon, or other synthetic fibers, and may be dyed. Synthetic bristles are often used with liquid and cream products, as they tend to blend out products more easily and will not absorb product as much as a natural bristle brush. Synthetic brushes are cruelty-free. Synthetic brushes usually last longer than natural haired bristles as they do not degrade and are not as fragile."
"The natural bristles are often dark in color, not super soft, sheds, hold pigments better and difficult to wash. As the natural bristles are very porous they pick up more pigments and distributes them evenly. The natural bristled brushes best applies powder products and it is best to avoid liquid or cream products as they will drink up most of the products. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves can cause allergic reactions to the animal hair."
"Natural bristles may more easily control the product when blending out or even packing on a product, because they have hair cuticles."
= = = Kabuki brush = = =
"A kabuki brush (sometimes called mushroom brush) is a makeup brush with a short stem and dense bristles. The brush head is most often rounded, though it can also be flat. Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles."
"It is named after the Kabuki Japanese drama theater where actors wear ""Keshō"", a very heavy makeup that emphasizes the nature of their characters. There, the kabuki brush is used to apply the white rice powder uniformly on the entire face."
"Usually, a kabuki brush is used to apply loose powdered make-up on large surfaces of the face (e.g., foundation, face powder, blush). Because of its design, the brush blends powdered make up evenly on the skin and creates a very natural looking coverage."
= = = St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia = = =
St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia is located in the Manayunk section of Northwest Philadelphia at 124 Cotton Street. This parish was merged with those of St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012.
"The church was named in honor of Saint Josaphat, who was born circa 1580 as John Kuncevic in Vladimir, a village of the Lithuanian Province of Volhynia (then a part of the Polish Kingdom begun under the Jagiellonian dynasty), and who rose to increasing positions of authority within the church after professing his faith. Murdered in Vitebsk (Belarus) on November 12, 1623 while working to reunify the diocese he had been assigned to lead, he was declared ""Blessed"" by Pope Urban VIII in May 1643. He was then canonized as a saint on June 29, 1867 by Pope Pius IX and, on the tercentenary of his martyrdom (November 12, 1923) was declared by Pope Pius XI to be the heavenly Patron of Reunion between Orthodox and Catholics."" On November 25, 1963, during the Second Vatican Council, the remains of Saint Josaphat were officially laid to rest at the altar of St. Basil in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This action was ordered by Pope John XXIII."
"St. Josaphat's parish was founded in 1898. According to historians at the Polish American Liturgical Center in Orchard Lake, Michigan:"
"""Polish Immigrants looking to better themselves financially, settled where there was more work. In the section of Philadelphia called Manayunk, there was a great need for workers in steel, wool and paper plants. Towards the end of the 19th Century near the Schuylkill River, there was a large steel plant under the name of American Bridge Co. later called Penncoyd Iron Works who employed many of these hard working Poles. The Poles living in Manayunk were very happy with their employment, but a little saddened by the fact that they had no Polish Church of their own to which they could go to and pray to God, to sing in their native tongue and to thank God for the graces given them. The nearest Polish Church which they attended was so many miles away, and travel in those days was hard, because the Mother Church, St. Laurentius, was located in the part of Philadelphia called 'Fishtown.'"
"Representatives of the Local Group appealed to the Diocesan Authorities for permission to establish a Polish Church for the Polish People. Archbishop Ryan in 1898 sent Rev. Mieczyslaus Kopytkiewicz to organize the Parish. The first services were held in St. John's Lower Church. (Incidentally, the services were held here also when the present new church was being built.)"""
"The Rev. Henry Chajencki was then placed in charge of the parish in December 1898. Under his leadership, church leaders paid $25,000 for the old Fourth Reformed Presbyterian Church building on the corner of Silverwood and Cotton, and also purchased ""a double home on Grape Street that served as a Rectory and later as a Convent"" as they worked to grow their number of parishioners. A 36-year-old in failing health, Father Chajencki died on Christmas Day in 1900, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery. The Rev. Dr. Thomas Misicki served briefly as the parish's pastor until the Rev. Benedict Tomiak could formally take charge of the post. All three men had been residents of Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania."
"Father Tomiak, who had been ministering to the poor as a member of the Congregation of the Missionary Fathers of Saint Vincent de Paul when he was drafted into the military and sent to the front to nurse soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War, and had been ordained in 1893 at the age of 50 after resuming his studies in Rome post-war, had emigrated to America shortly thereafter. Following seven years of service in Shamokin and Mt. Carmel he was appointed to his position at St. Josaphat's on January 20, 1901. During his 11-year tenure, he launched a parish parochial school (soon after arriving) and invited the Bernardine Sisters in as faculty, and founded two orphanages (one in West Conshohocken and the other in his native Wolsztyn). As the parochial school's student population grew, the Bernardines were replaced by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from New Britain, Connecticut (c. 1905-1910) and then the Sisters of Nazareth (c. 1910-1911)."
"Following the aging Father Tomiak's transition to a new role as Chaplain of the Orphanage, the Rev. Paul Guzik arrived from Matopolska to take over Tomiak's role as head of the parish. Soon after beginning work, Guzik determined that the existing school building was no longer adequate, raised $40,000 to build a ""yellow brick eight-room school,"" and then invited the Bernardine Sisters to return as faculty before making the decision to return to Poland. He was succeeded in 1913 by the Rev. Joseph Poremba, of St. Casimir's Parish of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. Both the school and the parish flourished under Poremba's leadership, which ended when he died suddenly from a heart attack in 1920. He was then succeeded in June of that year by the pastor of St. Stanislaus in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, Rev. Louis Stachowicz, who went on to lead St. Josaphat's for nearly four decades. Among his successes were the addition of 12 classrooms to the school building between 1927 and 1928, the launch of high school classes in 1939 (the first Polish pastor to achieve this milestone), the construction of a new, $130,000 rectory in 1949, and the construction of a new church building at the corner of Silverwood and Cotton streets with a spacious hall below the structure, which was dedicated on March 16, 1958 by the Most Reverend John F. O'Hara, C.S., D.D., Archbishop of Philadelphia."
"Following Father Stachowicz's death on February 10, 1960, the Rev. John Sielecki of St. Stanislaus Parish became the new parish head. Prior to his death on August 3, 1967, he was able to inspire his congregation to build a new convent for the sisters who served the parish and pay off the high school's tuition debt. Sielecki was then succeeded by another St. Stanislaus priest, the Rev. Paul A. Lambarksi, who immediately set to work improving the school's heating and lavatories after beginning work in October 1967. In short order, he was also actively engaged in preparing for the church's Diamond Jubilee (75th anniversary)."
"In 1973, St. Josaphat's became the fourth Polish parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to celebrate its 75th anniversary Diamond Jubilee."
"Lee Edgerton was named EISL Most Valuable Player for the 1998 season. Ed Carmean was honored with the EISL's first Sportsmanship Award, presented to the player who ""displays gentlemanly play and the ability to treat players, fans and officials with genuine respect and kindness."" Huntsville Fire players named to the 1998 EISL All-League Team included midfielder Lee Edgerton and defender Ed Carmean. Players named to the EISL All-League Third Team included defender Carlton Williams. Players receiving All-League Honorable Mentions included defender Abraham Francois and midfielder Jamie Harding."
"After the season, in late September 1998, the team fired its five-person staff, including head coach Scott Cooper and general manager Jim Krause, citing ""significant"" financial losses. Team president Bryan Dresden said he would not move or fold the team but that additional local investors were required for the team to continue. This became moot when the EISL itself folded in late December 1998."
= = = Clouds of Sils Maria = = =
"Clouds of Sils Maria (known simply as Sils Maria in some territories) is a 2014 drama film written and directed by Olivier Assayas, and starring Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film is a French-German-Swiss co-production. Principal photography took place from August to October 2013, with most of the filming taking place in Sils Maria, Switzerland. The film follows an established middle-aged actress (Binoche) who is cast as the older lover in a romantic lesbian drama opposite an upstart young starlet (Moretz). She is overcome with personal insecurities and professional jealousies—all while sexual tension simmers between her and her personal assistant (Stewart). The screenplay was written with Binoche in mind and incorporates elements from her life into the plot."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014, and also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival. The film received positive reviews, with critics lauding the work as psychologically complex and praising the lead actresses' performances. It won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014, and received six César Award nominations. Stewart received the César Award for Best Supporting Actress in February 2015."
"Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl ""Sigrid"" in both the play and film versions of """" by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and ""Helena,"" a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her."
"While traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in Sils Maria – a remote settlement in the Alps – Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ""Maloja Snake"" again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman."
"Maria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloë Grace Moretz), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals."
"Questions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend."
"During their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the Maloja Pass – to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the ""Maloja Snake"" of the play's title, but also the ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, a disconsolate Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear."
"A few weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ""Maloja Snake"" in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as ""too abstract for me"". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and that he does not relate to his era with its internet scandals and trashy values. Clearly he admires her and her work. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. Then she is on stage, smoking and waiting for Sigrid."
"Principal photography of ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" began on 22 August 2013 and ended on 4 October. The film was shot on location in the titular village of Sils Maria, Switzerland as well as Zurich; Leipzig, Germany; and South Tyrol, Italy."
"In an interview, Olivier Assayas said that all the film's interiors were shot in Germany. The production moved to Sils Maria to film the hiking scenes, and moved again to film the scenes in and around the chalet in South Tyrol."
"The Chanel company debuted in film financing with this production. In addition it supplied the actresses with clothes, jewelry, accessories, and makeup, and the brand was scripted in as a provider of the same to Maria. Chanel provided some of the budget to allow Olivier Assayas to fulfill his dream of shooting a film on 35-mm film instead of digitally."
"Assayas has described the fictional play ""Maloja Snake"" as a ""condensed, brutalized version"" of ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (it was later adapted as a film of the same name)."
"The American title of the film is ""Clouds of Sils Maria."" In France the film was released as ""Sils Maria,"" Assayas' original name."
The first trailer for the film was released on 22 May 2014. Another international trailer followed on 7 July.
The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival.
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews."
"Robbie Collin of ""The Daily Telegraph"" stated, ""This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama, another fearlessly intelligent film from Assayas."" He said, ""Binoche plays the role with elegance and melancholic wit – her character slips between fiction and fact in a way that recalls her role in Abbas Kiarostami's ""Certified Copy."" But it's Stewart who really shines here. Valentine is probably her best role to date: she's sharp and subtle, knowable and then suddenly distant, and a late, surprising twist is handled with a brilliant lightness of touch."""
"Peter Debruge of ""Variety"" said it was Assayas' ""daring rejoinder, a multi-layered, femme-driven meta-fiction that pushes all involved—including next-gen starlets Kristen Stewart and Chloë Grace Moretz — to new heights."" Matt Risley of ""Total Film"" called it ""an elegant, intelligent drama, enlivened by strong performances by Binoche, Moretz and especially Stewart, for whom this will surely usher in a new dawn."""
"Stephanie Zacharek of ""The Village Voice"" wrote: ""But the movie's true center, the meteorological phenomenon that makes it so pleasurable to watch, is the half-prickly, half-affectionate interplay between Binoche and Stewart."" Ben Sachs of ""Chicago Reader"" wrote: ""This recalls Ingmar Bergman's chamber dramas in the intensity and psychological complexity of the central relationship, yet the filmmaking is breathtakingly fluid, evoking a sense of romantic abandon."""
"However, Kyle Smith of the ""New York Post"" writes: ""A backstage drama that has all the sizzle of a glass of water resting on the windowsill, [...] ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" mistakes lack of dramatic imagination for smoldering subtlety."" Richard Brody from ""The New Yorker"" writes: ""Clouds of Sils Maria, as the title suggests, is a sort of travelogue, a commercial for European cultural tourism, and, as such, it's the perfect image of the very system that created it. There's almost no independent filmmaking in France, and there isn't supposed to be. If there were, it would stand as a threat to the system that, by way of training, enticements, and restrictions, is the source of the comforts that the movie depicts and that the movie reflects.

"The Yarnell Hill Fire was a wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona, ignited by lightning on June 28, 2013. On June 30, it overran and killed 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. Just one of the hotshots on the crew survived -- he was posted as a lookouot on the fire and was not with the others when the fire overtook them. The Yarnell Hill Fire was one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the 1991 East Bay Hills Fire, which killed 25 people, and the deadliest wildland fire for U.S. firefighters since the 1933 Griffith Park Fire, which killed 29 ""impromptu"" civilian firefighters drafted on short notice to help battle that Los Angeles area fire."
"Yarnell also killed more firefighters than any incident since the September 11 attacks on 9/11. That disaster killed 343 firefighters. The Yarnell Hill Fire is the sixth-deadliest American firefighter disaster in history, the deadliest wildfire ever in the state of Arizona, and (at least until 2014) was ""the most-publicized event in wildland firefighting history."""
"At 5:36 p.m. MST (23:36 UTC) on June 28, 2013, dry lightning ignited a wildfire on Bureau of Land Management lands near Yarnell, Arizona, a town of approximately 700 residents located about northwest of Phoenix. On June 30, strong winds reaching more than pushed the fire from to over . A long-term drought affecting the area contributed to the fire's rapid spread and erratic behavior, as did temperatures of ."
"By July 1, the fire had grown to over and prompted the evacuation of the nearby community of Peeples Valley. The fire was still completely uncontrolled, with more than 400 firefighters on the line. On July 2, the fire was estimated at 8% containment and had not grown in the past 24 hours. By the end of the day on July 3, the fire was reportedly 45 percent contained and not growing, thus allowing Peeples Valley residents to return to their homes on July 4. Four days later, on July 8, Yarnell residents were permitted to return. The fire was declared 100% contained on July 10."
"The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said that 127 buildings in Yarnell and two in Peeples Valley had been destroyed. A ""flash point"" of the fire was the Glen Ilah neighborhood of Yarnell, where fewer than half of the structures were burned. Officials shut down of Arizona State Route 89 shortly after the fire started, and of State Route 89 remained closed as of June 30."
"A total evacuation of Yarnell and partial evacuation of Peeples Valley was ordered. At least 600 people were under mandatory evacuation orders. An evacuation shelter was set up at Yavapai College in Prescott, with members of the Red Cross providing cots and blankets for overnight stays, along with meals and medical assistance."
"A second evacuation shelter was set up at Wickenburg High School in nearby Wickenburg, because the closure of State Route 89 made it impossible for some people to reach the first shelter. Officials from the Red Cross said that 351 people spent at least one night at one of the shelters."
"On June 30, firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire. Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters against the burnover, which reached over , but not all of the bodies were found inside them. The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1."
"The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough. He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC captain. Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew's entrapment."
"After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew."
"According to the National Fire Protection Association, it was the greatest loss of life for firefighters in a wildfire since the 1933 Griffith Park fire, the greatest loss of firefighters in the United States since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the deadliest wildfire of any kind since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire. The number of total fatalities—although not of firefighters—has since been surpassed by California's 2018 Camp fire which killed 85 civilians."
"On June 30, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer issued a statement offering her condolences. ""This is as dark a day as I can remember,"" she said. She ordered flags flown at half-staff in Arizona through July 19. President Barack Obama issued a statement on July 1, promising federal help and praising the 19 firefighters as heroes."
"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate and United States Fire Administrator Ernest Mitchell issued similar statements on July 1. On July 2, members of the Arizona Cardinals visited one of the Red Cross shelters, and the team president donated US$100,000 to the 100 Club of Arizona, an organization that assists firefighters, police, and their families in crises. Authorities said that US$800,000 had been raised for the families of the victims as of July 4."
"On July 2, more than 3,000 people attended a public memorial service at an indoor stadium in Prescott Valley. Vice President Joe Biden, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, and the team's lone surviving firefighter, Brendan McDonough, spoke at a memorial in Prescott on Tuesday, July 9. That memorial was attended by thousands, including representatives from over 100 hotshot crews across the country, and was streamed live by several media outlets. Individual memorial services were scheduled for later in the hometowns of the 19 firefighters."
"A nine-member investigative team of forest managers and safety experts arrived in Arizona on July 2. Their mission was to ""understand what happened as completely as possible"" to prevent similar incidents. Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each hotshot, are united by chains."
"A second memorial has been placed at the intersection of State Route 89 and Hays Ranch Road in Peeples Valley. On March 3, 2019, the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football retired the No. 19 jersey in honor of the nineteen fallen Granite Mountain Hotshots."
"After the fire, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ruled that the fire did not qualify for disaster aid to homeowners because most of the homes that burned were insured. Under federal law, federal disaster relief is not available if there is insurance, and FEMA said: ""damage to uninsured private residences from this was not beyond the response and recovery capabilities of the state (and) local governments and voluntary agencies."" Brewer appealed to President Obama to overturn the decision."
"Following a three-month investigation, the state's Forestry Division released a report and briefing video on September 28, 2013, which found no evidence of negligence nor recklessness in the deaths of the 19 firefighters and revealed that an airtanker carrying flame retardant was directly overhead as the firefighters died. The investigation did find some problems with radio communications due to heavy radio traffic and the fact that some radios were not programmed with appropriate tone guards."
"On December 4, 2013, the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees workplace safety, blamed the state's Forestry Division for the deaths of the 19 firefighters, based on an investigation by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The Commission said that state fire officials knowingly put protection of property ahead of safety and should have pulled crews out earlier. The commission levied a $559,000 fine."
"Richard Brody, in ""The New Yorker"": ""The Story That 'Only the Brave' Leaves Out"" (October 23, 2017), and Fernanda Santos, in ""The New York Times"": ""Money Splits a City Still Mourning Its Firefighters"" (June 26, 2014) point out numerous cases of firefighters' and their survivors' benefits having been withheld, lawsuits, and acrimony among the local politicians, some citizens, and the survivors of the firefighters who died in the Yarnell Hill Fire that became so extreme that, as Santos observes: ""Juliann Ashcraft decided to leave Prescott altogether to spare her four children the discomfort of whispers and glares."" Brody further points out ""battles that the Hotshots’ widows have faced over health insurance, taxes, labor law, and budgets, involving the online harassment of women""."

= = = Stadtbahnwagen B = = =
"The Stadtbahnwagen Typ B (translation ""Type ""B"" Light Rail Vehicle"", short form B-Wagen) is a light rail vehicle used by several Stadtbahn networks in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It was mainly developed by Düsseldorf-based DUEWAG, who also built the majority of vehicles in a consortium with Siemens and Kiepe. A small series of ten units was built by Waggon Union in Berlin. As the type evolved over two decades of production, some vehicles have little more in common than their outer dimensions and the basic configuration of a two-part multiple unit on three bogies with both outer ones powered. For the Dortmund Stadbahn, some cars were modified with a central section and a fourth bogie. These vehicles are referred to as ""B8"" or "" B80C/8"" (eight axles). These vehicles have a length of 38 m (124 ft 8.036 in) and a weight of 49 t."
"When the Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn network was planned in the early 1970s, standardised rolling stock was planned as well. At the same time, a second Stadtbahn network was planned for Cologne and Bonn. Because the future Cologne Stadtbahn already had one finished tunnel, that was built with the city's own money with streetcars in mind, the ""Stadtbahnwagen"" designed for the Rhine-Ruhr network was not suitable. So, another vehicle was designed for the Cologne/Bonn network, that was capable of driving though tighter curves. This vehicle, now referred to as ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ B"" was immediately ordered by transport authorities in Cologne and Bonn, while Rhine-Ruhr authorities remained hesitant about ""their"" vehicle, now renamed ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ A"". Eventually it was decided that the type ""A"" LRV was too unwieldy and type ""B"" LRVs were ordered by Essen, Mülheim, Düsseldorf, Duisburg and Dortmund. The type ""A"" concept, which consists of close coupled two-car sets, was shelved and later revived for the Stuttgart Stadtbahn."
"The ""Typ B"" formed the basis for the British-built Metrocars on the Tyne & Wear Metro, which opened in 1980."
Different variants are usually referred to by a combination of their top speed and a letter denoting the engine type.
= = = Training needs analysis = = =
Training Analysis (sometimes called Training Needs Analysis (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.
"Training Need Analysis (TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a series of steps that reveal whether training will help to solve problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each side of operational area of job so that the concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified."
"Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.needs additional citations for verification"
"Tools and methods for an integrated approach, Design Integrated Training Analysis, have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects."
"Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the man-in-the-loop has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, data assimilation, communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology. This has fueled the need for a formal approach."
"The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-"
"The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the transfer of training elements into the operational environment."
For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.

"Ladestien () is a broad walking track that strolls along the Trondheimsfjord around the entire Lade Peninsula in the municipality of Trondheim in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The track is about long. The western part of the track starts at Korsvika, about east of the center of Trondheim, and follows the fjord east to Charlottenlund. The western part climbs small hilltops, often with a beautiful view of the Trondheimsfjord. The eastern part is almost flat."
"There is lush vegetation along the track, with birch, pine, spruce, Rowan, alder, and hazel, the latter being very common in the western part of the track. In addition, sycamore maple, although not a part of the original flora, is rapidly spreading and is now among the most common trees. Further east, Statoils large research center at Rotvoll is easily spotted as the track continues east. Also at Rotvoll is the ""Leangen Manor"" (), including an English-inspired garden, with small water ponds and large deciduous trees (ash, elm, maple, oak). The manor is owned by Trondheim municipality and used for representational purposes."
"There are several beaches (mainly rocky or with pebbles) along Ladestien, some of the most popular are Ringvebukta (not far from Ringve Museum and botanical garden) and Djupvika; the latter includes a large lawn and volleyball net. Swimming in the fjord is indeed refreshing, although a water temperature of is fairly common during warm spells, and in warm summers water temperatures might reach .

"The Hall of Worthies, or Jiphyeonjeon (; ), was a royal research institute set up by Sejong the Great of the Korean Joseon Dynasty in March 1420. Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation. The Hall of Worthies is well-known for its role in compiling the Hunminjeongeum, the original treatise on Hangul."
"The Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press."
"The Hall of Worthies participated in various scholarly endeavors, one of which was compiling the Hunminjeongeum. Hangul was personally created by Sejong the Great, and revealed by him in 1443. Afterward, King Sejong wrote the preface to the Hunminjeongeum, explaining the origin and purpose of Hangul and providing brief examples and explanations, and then tasked the Hall of Worthies to write detailed examples and explanations. The head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, was responsible for compiling the Hunminjeongeum. The Hunminjeongeum was published and promulgated to the public in 1446."
"Confucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history. This compilation of works would become the book ""Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships"" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later."
"Besides contributing to the Hunminjeongeum and publishing the Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture."
"The Hall of Worthies was disbanded by King Sejo () after many of its members (notably the six martyred ministers) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong. However, a similar organization, the Hongmungwan (), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period."

= = = Eolith = = =
"An eolith (from Greek """"eos"""", dawn, and """"lithos"""", stone) is a chipped flint nodule. Eoliths were once thought to have been artifacts, the earliest stone tools, but are now believed to be geofacts (stone fragments produced by fully natural geological processes such as glaciation)."
"The first eoliths were collected in Kent by Benjamin Harrison, an amateur naturalist and archaeologist, in 1885 (though the name ""eolith"" was not coined until 1892, by J. Allen Browne). Harrison's discoveries were published by Sir Joseph Prestwich in 1891, and eoliths were generally accepted to have been crudely made tools, dating from the Pliocene. Further discoveries of eoliths in the early 20th century – in East Anglia by J. Reid Moir and in continental Europe by Aimé Louis Rutot and H. Klaatsch – were taken to be evidence of human habitation of those areas before the oldest known fossils. The English finds helped to secure acceptance of the hoax remains of Piltdown man."
"Because eoliths were so crude, concern began to be raised that they were indistinguishable from the natural processes of erosion. Marcellin Boule, a French archaeologist, published an argument against the artifactual status of eoliths in 1905, and Samuel Hazzledine Warren provided confirmation of Boule's view after carrying out experiments on flints."
"Although the debate continued for about three decades, more and more evidence was discovered that suggested a purely natural origin for eoliths. This, together with the discovery of genuine early Lower Pleistocene Oldowan tools in East Africa, made support for the artifact theory difficult to sustain."
"Rolling Thunder used skid brakes to stop the trains rather than modern fin brakes. The trains had brake pads underneath each car which slid against the brakes to lift the train's wheels off the track. The brakes were always in the up position unless the operator, in conjunction with the rear unloader attendant, advanced a train. The road wheels were heard spinning at the end of the ride and continued to spin until the operator, in conjunction with the unload attendant, advanced the train."
"There were three sets of brakes. The trim and ready brakes were located in the tunnel at the end of the ride. The trim brake slowed and stopped the train and served as a holding place for one train until the second train left the station. The train was advanced off the trim and onto the ready brake. The ready brake held the train until the second train reached the top half of the lift hill. The Dispatch brake held the train in the station while it was being unloaded and loaded for the next ride. The trains were stopped manually and were not always aligned with the queue stalls in the station. Therefore, the attendants had to direct the guests to their rows from time to time before the airgates were opened."
"When the brake pads and wheels got wet, there was little friction to stop the trains and they slid too far onto the brakes. For safety reasons, only one train ran per side in rainy weather."
"There were four trains that were distinguishable by color: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. Each train had four three-bench Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters cars held together by hitch bars. Each car contained six seats. Each train held a maximum of 24 riders."
The trains used buzz bars that locked in one position. Seat dividers and headrests were added in 1981 to prevent people from standing on the ride while it was in operation. Seat belts were added on the ride's 30th anniversary.
There were three types of wheels used on the trains. Sixteen road wheels rode on the steel layer on top of the track. Sixteen guide wheels guided the trains around the turned on a separate steel track located on the sides of the wooden track. Sixteen upstop wheels rode on the bottom of the track.
"On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from Middletown, NJ fell from the coaster to his death during a routine test run. An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that the man may not have secured himself with the safety bar. A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee ""may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints."" The ride was inspected, and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was ""operationally and mechanically sound."""

"The nurturant parent model also ""Nurturing Parent"" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system. In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive ."
"The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on parenting style. The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both ""roots in the ground and wings to fly."" He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings). The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence. As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges."
"At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground through managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally."
"The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.'"
Other ideas:
"This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in Human Development where researchers were investigating the parenting style preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the authoritative style. The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called ""the nurturing parent"" that focuses on responsibility, empathy, and creativity. The basic approach these parents used was to:"
"Herbert Jay Rosenfield (LCSW) in his unfinished book ""Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting"" encourages use of the acronym ""RECEPEE"", for ""Reasonable Expectations, Clearly Expressed, Performed Everyday and by Example"". ""The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!"" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym ""UCARE"":"
"Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that ""parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment""."
"The nurturant parent model is also discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics"" and ""Whose Freedom?"" In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the strict father model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then progressive politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance."
"The model is also consistent with slow parenting in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely."

"To acquire cards from the lawn, a player must first make it to the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or the player's normal roll. Then they have to prove they have that type of card by showing it and then flipping over the card they want. If they are correct, they take the card. If they are incorrect, they must put down the card they thought it was and take the wrong card. For one player to take from another, they must be on the same space as each other or in the same room. A player challenges another player's card by first proving that they have one of its set. If they do have the card, they must give it to the player or they can give them a ""No Clue"" card and this card is removed from the game. If they do not have the card, they are then able to challenge that player for a card with the same rules applying. The player's turn ends after this. To get a card from a room, they must first make it to the room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through the regular roll. Then they pick up the top card and discard the same card or another card if applicable into the lawn."
"To begin the game, each player rolls the dice to see who goes first. The player with the highest roll begins and play proceeds to the left. If a player rolls 7, 11, or doubles they are able to advance to any room of their choosing. Otherwise, they advance through the hallway spaces. They can travel in either direction, but cannot backtrack."
"If all cards have been taken from the rooms then the required cards for winning must be in either a players hand or in the lawn. All players advance through the Living Room by rolling a 7, 11, doubles, or through a standard dice roll. Once all the players are in the Living Room a new set of rules is followed."
"A player can challenge another player if they roll a 7, 11, or doubles with standard challenge rules applying. A player can pick from the lawn if they roll an odd number. Standard discard rules apply except when a player discards one of their cards back into the lawn, they place it face-up. If a player rolls an even number, they lose their turn."
"For two players, only 34 of 60 cards are used. Three complete ghosts, two complete weapons, three motive, and three ""No Clue"" cards are removed from the pack. Additionally only rooms 1-4 are used and 5 and 6 are left empty. For three players, only 48 of 60 cards are used. Two complete ghosts and one complete weapon is removed from the pack. All six rooms are still used."
"If a player wants a card from the Lawn and they don't have one of that kind in their hand, they may falsely identify the card wanted, in order to pick it up. For example: If a player was collecting Cleopatra cards and another player wished to hinder him, they may pick up a Cleopatra card from the lawn in this way: Show any card from their hand such as an Ax, point to the Cleopatra card on the lawn and say, ""This is an Ax card."" Since they pointed to the wrong card (on purpose), now they must pick up the Cleopatra card and lay down the Ax card."
"For a more difficult game, cards are kept on the lawn face down until the end of the game. Also players may complete and lay down more than one Ghost to increase their Rewards. However, to end the game, the Mystery must be solved as before. Now players add up their Rewards, counting their cards on the table and in their hands. One complete ghost or weapon is worth $500.00. One complete Alfred Hitchcock is worth $1000.00. The player that ends the game earns $1000.00 as well. Motive and ""No Clue"" cards have no value. $200.00 is deducting for each part of Alfred a player has at the end of the game or the ""It's A Mystery to Me"" card. With these additional rules, each player receiving the largest reward wins the game."
= = = Subsonic aircraft = = =
"A subsonic aircraft is an aircraft with a maximum speed less than the speed of sound (Mach 1). The term technically describes an aircraft that flies below its critical Mach number, typically around Mach 0.8. All current civil aircraft, including airliners, helicopters and airships, as well as many military types, are subsonic."
"Although high speeds are usually desirable in an aircraft, supersonic flight requires much bigger engines, higher fuel consumption and more advanced materials than subsonic flight. A subsonic type therefore costs far less than the equivalent supersonic design, has greater range and causes less harm to the environment."
"The less harsh subsonic environment also allows a much wider range of aircraft types, such as balloons, airships and rotorcraft, allowing them to fill a much wider range of roles."
"Subsonic flight is characterised aerodynamically by incompressible flow, where dynamic pressure changes due to motion through the air cause the air to flow away from areas of high dynamic pressure to areas of lower dynamic pressure, leaving the static pressure and density of the surrounding air constant. At high subsonic speeds, compressibility effects begin to appear."
"The propeller is one of the most efficient sources of thrust available and is common on subsonic aeroplanes and airships. Sometimes it is enclosed in the form of a ducted fan. At higher subsonic speeds and at high altitudes, such as attained by most airliners, the high-bypass turbofan becomes necessary. Pure jets such as the turbojet and ramjet are inefficient at subsonic speeds and not often used."
"The span and area of a wing are both important to the lift characteristics. They are related by the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the span, measured from tip to tip, to the average chord, measured from leading edge to trailing edge."
"The aerodynamic efficiency of a wing is described by its lift/drag ratio, with a wing giving high lift for little drag being the most efficient. A higher aspect ratio gives a higher lift/drag ratio and so is more efficient."
"The drag of a wing consists of two components, the induced drag, which is related to the production of lift, and the profile drag, largely due to skin friction which is contributed to by the whole wing area. It is therefore desirable for a wing to have the least area compatible with the desired lift characteristics. This is best achieved with a high aspect ratio, and high-performance types often have this kind of wing."
"But other considerations such as light weight, structural stiffness, manoeuvrability, ground handling and so on often benefit from a shorter span and, consequently a less efficient wing. Small, low-altitude general aviation planes typically have aspect ratios of six or seven; airliners of 12 or more; and high-performance sailplanes of 30 or more."
"At speeds above the critical Mach number, the airflow begins to become transonic, with local airflow in some places causing small sonic shock waves to form. This soon leads to the shock stall, causing a rapid increase in drag. The wings of fast subsonic craft such as jet airliners tend to be swept in order to delay the onset of these shock waves."
"In theory, induced drag is at its minimum when the span wise distribution of lift is elliptical. A number of factors influence induced drag, however, and as a practical matter a wing of elliptical planform, like that of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter of World War II, is not necessarily the most efficient. The wings of jet airliners, which are highly optimized for efficiency, are far from elliptical in shape."
"The ratio of tip chord to root chord is called the taper ratio. Taper has the desirable effect of reducing the root bending stress by shifting the lift inboard, but it has been argued by some noted designers, including John Thorp and Karl Bergey, that an untapered rectangular planform is best for aeroplanes of less than 6,000 pounds gross weight."

"""Izumrud"" was ordered as part of the Imperial Russian Navy's plan to expand the Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur and Vladivostok to counter the growing threat posed by the Imperial Japanese Navy towards Russian hegemony in Manchuria and Korea."
"""Izumrud"" was laid down at the Nevsky Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 1 January 1901. However, construction was delayed due to priority given to completion of . The ""Zakladka"", or formal ceremony of laying a plate, took place on 14 June 1902. ""Izumrud"" was launched on 1 October 1903. Construction continued to be plagued by delays, including an ice storm in December. However, with the start of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904, construction efforts were greatly accelerated."
"""Izumrud"" was formally commissioned in January 1904 and she was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet."
"Under the overall command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, ""Izumrud"" was part of the Second Pacific Squadron intended to relieve the Japanese siege of Port Arthur. Captained by Commander Vasili Fersen, she participated in the decisive Battle of Tsushima from 27–28 May 1905. At the end of the battle, Fersen refused to obey the order of Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov to surrender, and used her speed to escape through the Japanese blockade. However, on the night of 28 May, she ran aground in Vladimir Bay in the Russian Maritime Province. She was destroyed by explosive charges set by her crew, who later reached Vladivostok by land."

= = = Niall Matter = = =
"Niall Matter ( ; born October 20, 1980) is a Canadian-American actor."
"Following recovery from a serious accident sustained while working on an oil rig, Matter chose to pursue a full-time acting career. He received his first significant break in 2007, with a main role in teen drama ""The Best Years"". Later in the same year, he joined the cast of ""Eureka"" as bad-boy genius Zane Donovan. In 2009 he had a small supporting role in Zack Snyder's film ""Watchmen"". He went on to star as Evan Cross in the short-lived 2012 series """". His career subsequently moved away from science fiction, seeing him star in several television movies, as well as joining Canadian series such as ""Remedy"", ""Arctic Air"" and ""When Calls the Heart""."
"Born in Edmonton, Alberta, of Irish and Russian descent, Matter grew up on his parents' dairy farm. He is a third-generation oil rigger, having worked on the oil rigs in Northern Alberta for eight years. On the recommendation of a school teacher, he enrolled in drama classes at age thirteen, going on to win the Best Actor prize at a provincial drama championship in 1999. However, after getting himself in trouble at age 17, his parents sent him for a three-month stint on the oil rigs to work with his grandfather. He has acknowledged that it was this experience that helped him to focus on his studies and pass his high school exams. He continued to work on the oil rigs alongside his grandfather and brother Trevor until the age of 25, while simultaneously moving to Vancouver and attending Vancouver Film School in pursuit of his long-term goal of an acting career."
"At the age of 25 Matter had a serious accident while working on the oil rigs, where he was nearly crushed inside the cab of a 17-ton drilling rig. His quad muscle had been detached from his femur, and he nearly lost his right leg. It took six months for him to be fully rehabilitated, having to go through extensive physio therapy to fully regain his ability to walk. On returning to the oil rigs, he witnessed another accident in which a man lost both his legs. This convinced him that it was time to move on, so he quit, returning to Vancouver, where he lied his way into a bar tending job before landing his first acting role."
"Matter landed his first professional acting job in 2007 playing the lead role of baitshop owner Josh Riley in the Syfy original film ""Loch Ness Terror"", (broadcast as ""Beyond Loch Ness""), which also starred Brian Krause and Don S Davis. While filming ""Loch Ness"" he sent an audition tape to the producers of ""The Best Years"" which lead to him gaining the main cast role of bar tender, and cocaine addict, Trent Hamilton in the series first season. He went on to play the role of USAF airman Lieutenant Kemp in a two-episode guest spot on the Syfy television series ""Stargate Atlantis""."
"He subsequently auditioned for the Syfy series ""Eureka"". for what he understood was a one-episode guest star role. By his own admission, Matter took risks in the audition, playing the character as more flirtatious than he was written. The risks paid off, and he was cast in the role of bad boy genius Zane Donovan, first appearing in the season two episode ""E=MC...?"". The character would go on to develop a romantic relationship with the town's Deputy Sheriff Jo Lupo played by Erica Cerra. His role was recurring throughout seasons two and three. Season four saw a soft reboot of the show - following a time traveling incident, the characters return to an alternate timeline, with character dynamics and relationships shifting. This led to Matter's role as Zane being expanded as he became part of the main cast, which continued through to the show's fifth and final season."
"During this time, he also had guest roles on ""Warehouse 13"", portraying one half of a married couple alongside ""Eureka"" castmate Cerra and on NBC's ""Fear Itself"", playing a lovelorn zombie. In 2009/2010, Matter appeared as a recurring guest star on The CW shows ""Melrose Place"" (as record producer Rick) and ""90210"" as Greg, a teacher and subsequent love interest to Erin Silver."
"In 2009, Matter played a small role in Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" film, portraying one of the Minute Men, Byron Lewis/Mothman. He also appeared in the short film accompanying the 'ultimate cut' DVD release of the film entitled ""Under the Hood"", a faux documentary on the Minute Men."
"From 2012 to 2013, Matter played the lead character of Evan Cross, a millionaire inventor searching for anomalies following the brutal killing of his wife by an Albertosaurus, in Space's science fiction series """", a spin-off of the British series ""Primeval"". In 2013, this role earned him a Constellation Award in the Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode category, for his performance in the episode ""Truth"". He was also nominated for a Leo Award in the Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series category, for the same episode. Due to low ratings, the series was not renewed for a second season."
"In March 2014, ""Deadline Hollywood"" announced that he had landed the role of Lieutenant Graden Hales in the TNT commissioned pilot of Marcia Clark's ""Guilt by Association"" alongside Julia Stiles, which TNT ultimately declined to pick up."
"He subsequently appeared in guest roles in various American and Canadian series. In CTV's ""Motive"" he played a man driven to murder in revenge for his sister's death; in the short-lived NBC series ""Constantine"" he played a father struggling to deal with the supernatural and in the TNT police procedural ""Rizzoli and Isles"" he portrayed a Detective turned murderer. He also had a recurring role in the third season of the CBC series ""Arctic Air"" as Tag Cummins, the love interest of the series female protagonist, Krista Ivarson, portrayed by Pascale Hutton. Additionally, Matter appeared in the 'VIP Lounge' online content produced to accompany the show, which was available through the series page on the CBC website."
"Matter appeared in the 2014 Calgary International Film Festival's closing gala film, dark-comedy/thriller ""Ally Was Screaming"".

"Bangladesh–Indonesia relations refers to the bilateral relations of Bangladesh and Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, whereas Bangladesh is the world's fourth largest Muslim country. They are partners in the United Nations and various multilateral organisations, particularly in international peacekeeping, the Developing 8 Countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Bangladesh has an embassy in Jakarta, whereas Indonesia has an embassy in Dhaka. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1972 after Indonesia became one of the first Muslim countries to recognise independent Bangladesh."
"The contacts between the Bay of Bengal region with Indonesian archipelago has commenced since centuries ago. Indonesia and Bangladesh were connected to maritime Silk Road of Indian Ocean trade network, where goods travels and ideas exchanged. Since early 4th-century Indonesia has received Hindu, and subsequently Buddhist influences from Indian subcontinent. In 9th-century the Srivijaya empire established contacts through religious and education relations with Buddhist schools, monasteries and universities in ancient India and Bangladesh, such as Nalanda and Somapura."
"After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Indonesia along with other non-Arab Muslim countries such as Malaysia, Turkey and Afghanistan immediately recognised Bangladesh sovereignty in 1971. Subsequently, Bangladesh soon after its independence in 1971 established diplomatic relations with Indonesia and the Embassy started functioning from May 1972."
"Both nations welcomes initiatives in furthering the bilateral co-operation in various areas including trade and investment, agriculture, defence, education, food security, good governance, counter-terrorism, research and technology as well as disaster mitigation and management. Besides bilateral co-operation, both nations exchanged their views on the two countries' co-operation in regional and global fora. As the Muslim majority countries, both nations also exchange view and voiced their concern on addressing the Rohingya Muslim refugees issue in neighbouring Myanmar."
"At the end of October, both Bangladesh and Indonesia saw strikes involving millions of low-wage workers demanding substantial increases in their minimum wages.

= = = Bamboozle (quiz) = = =
"Bamboozle! was a quiz game featured on Channel 4 Teletext in the United Kingdom. It was originally part of Teletext's ""Fun & Games"" category, though the rest of the category had been discontinued for some years before Bamboozle! ended (due to the general discontinuation of all Teletext news and editorial content in December 2009). The last edition, themed around 'Ends and Lasts', appeared on Monday 14 December 2009. The Boozler 'family' appeared one last time on Tuesday 15 December 2009 saying farewell to the Teletext audience."
"On 9 August 2010 Bamboozle! was given a new home by Teletext on the iPhone complete with all the retro graphics. On 11 July 2019, Teletext Holidays launched a version of the Bamboozle quiz on their 404 error page."
"Bamboozle! was originally intended as a real-time game that could be played in conjunction with a broadcast TV programme using a similar multiple choice format as ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". The decision by the new broadcast teletext franchise holders (Teletext UK) in 1993 to opt for X.25 packet switching meant that it was impossible to adequately synchronise the broadcast of teletext content in the context of a TV programme. The format thus fell back to the form it had operated in largely unchanged since 1994."
"The game used Fastext keys (different coloured buttons on the TV remote control) to select the desired answer from a choice of four, and was ""presented"" by virtual host Bamber Boozler, who derived his name from the word ""bamboozle"" and the name of University Challenge host, Bamber Gascoigne. Bamber Boozler's appearance was constrained by the limitations of the Level 1 World System Teletext alpha mosaic display format. From 1993–2005, Teletext competitions editor Julian Edwards created the quiz ""Bamber Boozler"" and the character ""Bamber Boozler"". In later years, journalists Charlie Ghagan and, latterly, Roger Wilkinson oversaw the quiz. Roger Wilkinson also provides content for the Teletext iPhone app."
"A new set of questions was originally given each week, but this soon became more regular, eventually becoming daily. Each game originally had 25 questions, later reduced to 20, then 15 and eventually 12. The player was required to answer all questions correctly in order to complete the quiz, but was allowed multiple attempts to do so. Initially, if a question was answered incorrectly, the player would have to start again from Question 1, However this was later amended so that a maximum of three questions would need to be answered again. After completing the quiz, there was a score table with themed responses, for example:"
according to how many questions were answered correctly at the first attempt.
"On particular dates the quiz was themed, for example Halloween featured related questions and images of skeletons and spiders, whilst Guy Fawkes Night featured firework based questions, as well as numerous Christmas based versions. There were also special ""name the picture / person"" graphical editions."
"Other Boozler family members were introduced over the game's first few years – Bamber's wife, Bambette, who normally appeared when a question was answered incorrectly; while Saturday's quizzes were generally easier than the weekday editions and were presented by Bamber's son, Buster, with Bambette's role filled by Bonnie, his daughter. At one point in the quiz's history the red, yellow and green keys were sensible answers and the blue was mostly reserved for a comical response although rarely was the correct one. This was later changed and all the keys would have sensible answers."
"The quiz started off at 20 questions, then it went down to 15 and then 12. On very few special occasions it was 30, however one question wrong and contestants had to start from the very beginning."
"The ""Bad Luck"" pages appeared when questions were answered incorrectly, they used to feature little trivial messages at first and then mainly birthday announcements. This was scrapped to introduce ""Bambette's Bonus"" (or Bonnie's Bonus in Junior Bamboozle) where contestants could score again with a question from her. This was not a multiple choice question and contestants could get the answer by pressing the reveal button."
"The makers of ""Bamboozle!"" introduced a weekly competition whereby a viewer could contribute the questions to Bamboozle! As well as having their questions used, names mentioned and their image appear on screen (the viewer could supply a photograph, which was converted to a Teletext-style cartoon); the winning contributors also received a £20 WHSmith gift voucher. Even before this, viewer-submitted questions were readily used in various forms ever since the early days of the quiz."
"Back in the early days of ""Bamboozle!"", on a number of occasions the quiz would be put on hold and in its place was an adventure game (a different one each time), based on the popular children's fantasy programme ""Knightmare"". Viewers had to use the fastext keys to navigate their way through the quest."
"""Ten to One"", was a sports version of ""Bamboozle!"" with the host Brian Boozler. The quiz was so called because it presented ten sports questions and players had to get from the ten down to one. It is a double meaning as Ten to One also relates to bookies popular odds on betting in many sports."
"This quiz ran concurrently with Bamboozle! for sometime until late 1998 where Brian said ""I'm putting down the mic for a bit, I'm back in 1999..."", however it never returned. He was however, during the period that the quiz was ""rested"", a guest quizmaster on Bamboozle! asking the contestants sports questions like before, with Bamber saying at the end ""Thanks Brian... check your score below!""."
"""Junior Bamboozle!"" was a version run on Saturdays for children. It was hosted by Buster Boozler and the bad luck pages were hosted by Bonnie Boozler."

"Mike and Ike is a brand of fruit-flavored candies that were first introduced in 1940 by the company Just Born, Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years."
"The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the Matina Brothers, two of whom, nicknamed ""Mike"" & ""Ike,"" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as Munchkins in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz""; the author Dean Jensen wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them. . Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a vaudeville song titled “Mike and Ike”, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose nickname was ""Ike."" Just Born acquired the ""Rodda Candy Company"" in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since."
"Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar. The candy is kosher and gluten-free."
"They are similar to Hot Tamales, another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy."
"Just Born produces several varieties of Mike and Ikes, including:"
Retro/limited varieties include:
There are also seasonal packages for Easter in which the Mike and Ike flavors are formed as jelly beans.

= = = Birlinn = = =
"The birlinn (spelt ""bìrlinn"" in Scottish Gaelic) was a wooden vessel propelled by sail and oar, used extensively in the Hebrides and West Highlands of Scotland from the Middle Ages on. Variants of the name in English and Lowland Scots include ""berlin"" and ""birling"". The Gallo-Norse term may derive from the Norse ""byrðingr"" (ship of boards). It has been suggested that a local design lineage might also be traceable to vessels similar to the Broighter-type boat (first century BC), equipped with oars and a square sail, without the need to assume a specific Viking design influence. It is uncertain, however, whether the Broighter model represents a wooden vessel or a skin-covered boat of the currach type. The majority of scholars emphasise the Viking influence on the birlinn."
"The birlinn was clinker-built and could be sailed or rowed. It had a single mast with a square sail. Smaller vessels of this type might have had as few as twelve oars, with the larger West Highland galley having as many as forty. For over four hundred years, down to the seventeenth century, the birlinn was the dominant vessel in the Hebrides."
"A 1615 report to the Scottish Privy Council made a distinction between galleys, having between 18 and 20 oars, and birlinns, with between 12 and 18 oars. There was no suggestion of structural differences. The report stated that there were three men per oar."
"The birlinn appears in Scottish heraldry as the ""lymphad"" (a corruption of ""long fhada"" (longship)."
"In terms of design and function, there was considerable similarity between the local birlinn and the ships used by Norse incomers to the Isles. In an island environment ships were essential for the warfare which was endemic in the area, and local lords used the birlinn extensively from at least the thirteenth century. The strongest of the regional naval powers were the Macdonalds of Islay."
"The Lords of the Isles of the Late Middle Ages maintained the largest fleet in the Hebrides. It is possible that vessels of the birlinn type were used in the 1156 sea battle in which Somerled, Lord of Argyll, the ancestor of the lords, firmly established himself in the Hebrides by confronting his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles."
"Though the surviving evidence has mostly to do with the birlinn in a naval context, there is independent evidence of mercantile activity for which such shipping would have been essential. There is some evidence for mercantile centres in Islay, Gigha, Kintyre and Knapdale, and in the fourteenth century there was constant trade between the Isles, Ireland and England under the patronage of local lords. Otherwise the chief uses of the birlinn would have been troop-carrying, fishing and cattle transport."
"In some ways the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin planking (strake) was constructed on the basis of the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames."
"Oak was the wood favoured both in Western Scotland and in Scandinavia, being tough and resistant to decay. Other types of timber were less often used. It is likely that the Outer Isles of Western Scotland had always been short of timber, but birch, oak and pine abounded in the Inner Isles and on the mainland. The abundance of timber at Lochaber was proverbial: """"B'e sin fiodh a chur do Loch Abar"""" (""Bringing wood to Lochaber"") was said of any superfluous undertaking."
"The tools used are likely to have included adzes, axes, augers and spoon bits, auls, planes, draw knives and moulding irons, together with other tools typical of the Northern European carpenter's kit. As in traditional shipbuilding, generally, measurements were largely by eye."
"The traditional practice of sheltering boats in bank-cuttings (""nausts"") – small artificial harbours – was probably also employed with the birlinn. There is evidence in fortified sites of constructed harbours, boat-landings and sea-gates."
"The influence of Norse shipbuilding techniques, though plausible, is conjectural, since to date no substantial remnants of a birlinn have been found. Traditional boat-building techniques and terms, however, may furnish a guide as to the vessel's construction."
"Carved images of the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, forestay and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a ""beitass"" by the Norse). This was used to push the luff of the sail out into the wind."
"Traditional Highland practice was to make sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather. Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of reef points."
"A reproduction of a 16 oar Highland galley, the ""Aileach"", was built in 1991 at Moville in Donegal. It was based on representations of such vessels in West Highland sculpture. Despite the good seagoing performance of the vessel, its design has been described as misleading because of an over-reliance in the plan on cramped sculptural images. The vessel was designed with a high, almost vertical, stern and stem. It proved difficult to fit in more than one rower per oar and the thwarts were too close together. Less constricted images from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show vessels which are longer and larger."
"The birlinn had a significant symbolic and thematic place in Gaelic literature. Examples can be found in the songs of Màiri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Mary MacLeod) (c.1615 – c.1705), an important poet in the Hebridean lordship of the MacLeods. In a lament she describes a ship wrecked by storm, with the wind ripping the sail in a way that defied the strength of the crew:"
"In another song a ship is described as setting forth from ""Dunvegan of the harps"": may the crew (says the poet), from the mast-heads aloft to the halyards below, keep it close to the wind that takes it across the straits:"

"Mortal Kombat: Conquest (stylized on-screen as Mortal Kombat: Konquest) is an American martial arts television series based on the ""Mortal Kombat"" fighting game series, which aired for one season, from 1998 to 1999. Set prior to the events of the first game, the series follows the original Kung Lao (Paolo Montalbán) as he protects Earthrealm with the help of warriors Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and Taja (Kristanna Loken)."
"Many centuries ago, Earth was an enchanting and desirable planet. Powerful and rich with natural resources, the vicious megalomaniac Shao Kahn wanted Earth as part of his growing collection of conquered realms known as Outworld. To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat was created: a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Kahn imprisoned Tsung in the cobalt mines."
"Kung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao created a partnership and friendship between two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Rayden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own."

"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the ""Mortal Kombat"" film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Television Distribution distributed the series. The program was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. The Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the ""Mortal Kombat"" property), as New Line's corporate sibling-turned-parent, syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, which aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats of the first-run syndication run. With a lucrative timeslot following ""WCW Monday Nitro"", ""Conquest"" was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the ""MK"" timeline."
"""Mortal Kombat: Conquest"" has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it enjoyed a more successful run on television. Unofficial collections produced in the UK consist of unrelated and edited episodes merged so that each disc contains a theme, and some of the DVDs contain spelling errors on the covers. Several episodes of the series, consisting of one show per disc, were released in Germany; two of the discs feature episodes centered around Kreeya and Sub-Zero. DVDs were also recently released in Portugal, with many spelling errors on the covers.

= = = Just'a Lotta Animals = = =
Just'a Lotta Animals is a fictional superhero team that appeared in stories published by DC Comics. The team is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody of the Justice League of America.
"Just'a Lotta Animals originally appeared in the series ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!"" as the name of a superhero comic book written and drawn by Captain Carrot's alter ego, Roger Rodney Rabbit. Various panels of the Just'a Lotta Animals' comic that were shown in the ""Captain Carrot"" series were often parodies of classic Justice League storylines. The team was in fact the original proposal by Zoo Crew creators Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw for a funny animal superhero series for DC, but DC's editor Dick Giordano asked them to create original characters instead. They agreed and created the Zoo Crew, but still ended up introducing the Just'a Lotta Animals team in the series."
"In ""Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew"" #14 and #15, in a storyline titled ""Crisis On Earth-C!,"" the Just'a Lotta Animals were finally revealed to actually exist, on a parallel Earth named ""Earth-C-Minus"" (as opposed to the world of the Zoo Crew, which was named ""Earth-C""). The two teams united to defeat the villains of the story, Dr. Hoot (an owl mad scientist) and Feline Faust (a cat sorcerer; an analog of Justice League villain Felix Faust)."
"The team's imagery was brought to life by a confused paranormal teenager in the second part of the ""Young Justice: World Without Grownups"" storyline."
"Just'a Lotta Animals lived on the parallel world of Earth-C-Minus, and made its headquarters in an orbiting satellite space station."
"Events and characters on Earth-C-Minus were considered to be fictional to natives of Earth-C, similar to how events and characters of Earth-Two were considered as fictional on Earth-One. Additionally, events and characters on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One. Like Earth-C, the names of characters and locations tended to make heavy use of various animal-based puns."
"After the events of the 1985 miniseries ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"", it was revealed that Earth-C-Minus (and Earth-C) survived intact, as they were actually ""alternate dimensions"" instead of parallel Earths, although the most recent mini-series ""Captain Carrot and the Final Ark"" has suggested that Earth-C is now also considered Earth-26, one of the new 52 parallel Earths in the new DC Multiverse."

"Ipatiev House () was a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg (later renamed Sverdlovsk) where the former Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (1868–1918, reigned 1894–1917), his family, and members of his household were executed in July 1918 following the Bolshevik Revolution. Its name is identical to that of the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, from where the Romanovs came to the throne. As an act for the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolutions, it was demolished in 1977 by orders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the local communist soviet government, almost 59 years after the Romanov family execution and 14 years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1990–1991."
"In the 1880s, Ivan Redikortsev, an official involved in the mining industry, commissioned a two-story house to be built on the slope of a prominent hill. The length of the facade was 31 metres. In 1898, the mansion passed to Sharaviev, a gold dealer of tainted reputation. Ten years later, the house was acquired by Nikolai Nikolayevich Ipatiev, a military engineer, who turned the ground floor into his office."
"It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Pyotr Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Ural Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called ""The House of Special Purpose."""
"The Imperial Romanov family moved in on 30 April 1918 and spent 78 days at the house. This household included Tsar Nicholas Romanov, his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, their four daughters, their son and heir Alexei, the Tsarevich (crown prince); their court physician Dr. Yevgeny Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov, and valet Alexei Trupp. They occupied four rooms on the upper story of the Ipatiev House, while their guards were housed on the ground floor. From early July, command of this guard was taken over by Yakov Yurovsky, a senior member of the Ural Soviet."
"Goldstein was the first to write a learned commentary specifically on Rebbe Nachman's teachings, giving scholarly legitimacy to the Breslov movement after the death of Reb Noson in 1844. Many of today's English-language translations of Breslover works were only made possible because of the Tcheriner Rav's meticulous research and elucidation."
"He collected and published Noson's eight-volume magnum opus, ""Likutey Halachot"", as well as an expanded version of Noson's ""Likutey Etzot"" (Advice) with additional material from Rebbe Nachman's teachings, under the title, ""Likutey Etzot HaMeshulash"". Altogether, the Tcheriner Rav authored about 20 works, including halakhic responsa. Some were only seen by Breslover Hasidim in manuscript form before they were lost during World War II. The ones that survive are:"
"Goldstein also produced a collection of source texts for ""Sefer HaMiddot"" (The Aleph-Bet Book—a collection of aphorisms on character traits), tracing Rebbe Nachman's references throughout the Bible, Talmud and Midrash. He also compiled teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezeritch and their major disciples under the titles ""Leshon Hasidim"" and ""Derekh Hasidim""."
= = = Alameda Terminal = = =
"Alameda Terminal (a.k.a. Alameda Wharf) was a railroad station and ferry wharf at the foot and west of present-day Pacific Avenue and Main Street in Alameda, California, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay with ferry service to San Francisco. It was built in 1864 and operated by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. In 1869, it served as the original west coast terminus of the U.S. First Transcontinental Railroad, until the opening of Oakland Pier two months later. The western terminus was inaugurated September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus completing the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast."
"The Pacific Railroad Act passed by the United States Congress in 1862 authorized construction of the First transcontinental railroad and telegraph line, which included connecting the Central Pacific Railroad in the west with the Union Pacific Railroad in the east. In 1863, the first construction activity took the Central Pacific line eastward from Sacramento. In October 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad assigned all the rights of the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 to the Western Pacific Railroad for the route between Sacramento and San Jose, including land grants. The plan was that the transcontinental railroad would follow the Western Pacific to San Jose and then connect with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ), completed in 1864, to San Francisco."
"By 1866, the Western Pacific had built of track north and east from San Jose, reaching halfway into Niles Canyon, to about Farwell near MilePost33. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Construction was then halted because of disagreements between the railroad’s contractors and its financiers."
"In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point in 1868, restarted work on the railroad line through Niles Canyon, also using Chinese laborers, and added a new line from the mouth of the canyon northwest towards the city of Oakland and Oakland Point. The new plan was to connect with Oakland with its ferry service to San Francisco. In June 1869, J. H. Strobridge came to Niles (then Vallejo Mills and now part of Fremont) to oversee the construction of the new line heading towards Oakland. In September 1869, a temporary connection was made at the bay side of San Leandro with the old tracks of San Francisco and Alameda Railroad, which led to the SF&A Alameda Wharf with ferry service to San Francisco."
"On September 6, 1869, the first Western Pacific train reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus achieving the transcontinental ""Pacific Railroad"" envisioned in the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act. According to the ""Daily Alta California"", this first through train left Sacramento at 10 am, got delayed by some construction trains, exited Niles Canyon late at 9:30 pm, and an hour later arrived at Alameda Terminal to a cheering crowd. Two months later, Central Pacific Railroad switched the western transcontinental terminus to its expanded Oakland Pier, which was inaugurated on November 8, 1869, in another round of celebration."
Alameda then went back to local train service only. In 1870 the SF&A was absorbed into Central Pacific and in 1873 the original SF&A pier was abandoned.
The railroads and their wharfs are gone from Alameda. The last rails were removed in 1960 from Lincoln Ave (formerly Railroad Ave and along which the SF&A rails ran).
"The achievement of the first transcontinental railroad reaching Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869 is marked by a plaque in the Naval Air Station Alameda and a California Historical Landmark (CHL #440) nearby. The GPS coordinates of the two markers are given respectively by ""37.786779,-122.30292"" (plaque); and ""37.77535,-122.276891"" (CHL #440)."
"On 6 September 2019, a ""golden spike"" ceremony was held in Niles Canyon, where the Western Pacific tracks laid in 1866 met the Central Pacific tracks laid in 1869, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 6 September 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad to the original Pacific coast terminus at Alameda Terminal. Also, the mayor of the City of Alameda issued a proclamation recognizing ""the outstanding contributions of the many Chinese immigrants who helped make the Transcontinental Railroad a reality""."

"The waterfall is easily accessed, in contrast to its near neighbor Oneonta Falls, as it is right next to the Historic Columbia River Highway. The shape of the falls and the rounded rockface over which it flows cause it to resemble a horse's tail."

= = = Route poisoning = = =
"Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within computer networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. Unlike the ""split horizon with poison reverse"", route poisoning provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network."
"When the protocol detects an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are informed that the bad route has an infinite (∞) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, preventing any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid route."
"Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use a maximum hop count to determine how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. Route poisoning is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform route poisoning on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent."
"If these updates are lost, some nodes in the network would not be informed that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is used in conjunction with holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network."

"Until 2001, the Bundesliga was directly under the control German football's governing body the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association). This changed with the formation of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German Football League) when the Bundesligen came under the auspices of this new body. The DFL, while remaining subordinate to the DFB, manages Germany's professional leagues and is responsible for the issuing of licences to clubs, general fiscal oversight of the Bundesligen, and marketing rights for the two upper leagues."
"Since the launch of the Bundesliga on 24 August 1963 fifty-five clubs have played in the league ranks. To help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the league, two clubs with distinguished Bundesliga histories met in a game on 24 August 2003: Hamburger SV, once known as the ""dinosaur"" for being the only club which has played in every season of the league's existence until relegation in 2018, and Bayern Munich, the most successful side in German football, which had just won their seventeenth Bundesliga title."
"In 2005, German football was once again overshadowed by the discovery of a match-fixing scandal involving second division referee Robert Hoyzer, who confessed to fixing and betting on matches in the 2. Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the Regionalliga (III). The games included a DFB-Pokal first-round match between regional side Paderborn and Bundesliga heavyweights Hamburg on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost (2–4) through penalties and a red-card charged to the side and was eliminated from the lucrative competition."
"Hoyzer was banned for life and received a 29-month prison sentence. He soon implicated other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers, leading to an ongoing investigation. To this point, at the end of 2005, it appears that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions:"
"Despite the scandal, the Bundesliga continues to set new attendance records. In the Bundesliga's 43rd season, total attendance was about 12.41 million in 306 games for an average of 40,572 per game, a 6.9% increase over the preceding year, making the 2005–06 season the 5th consecutive record attendance year. After a decrease in 2006–07 and a slight recovery in 2007–08, new records were set in 2008–09, with 12.82 million total attendance and a per-game average of 41,904. The 2008–09 figure makes the Bundesliga the best-attended national football league in the world by per-game attendance. It is also third in per-game attendance among major professional sports leagues in the world, slightly ahead of the Australian Football League (Australian rules) and well behind the second-ranked Indian Premier League (Twenty20 cricket) and top-ranked NFL (American football) in the United States. Top drawing clubs based on average attendance included: Borussia Dortmund 72,850; FC Bayern Munich 67,214; FC Schalke 04 61,177; and Hamburger SV 53,298. Interest in the league was piqued by the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted in Germany. An ambitious program of stadium upgrades was undertaken in preparation for the tournament."
"The 2. Bundesliga saw an enormous increase in popularity in 2006–07, drawing about 4.67 million spectators for an average of 15,253. This not only smashed the league's previous attendance record, but also marked an increase of more than 20% over the 2005–06 season. The league saw another huge increase in popularity in 2007–08, drawing 5.55 million spectators for an average of 18,140, an increase of almost 19% over the previous season, which briefly made the 2. Bundesliga the most-attended second-level professional sports league in the world on a per-game basis. However, the league would lose almost all of these gains in 2008–09, with total attendance of 4.76 million and an average of 15,550. Although the Second Bundesliga is now second in attendance to England's Football League Championship among second-level professional sports leagues, it still draws more spectators per game than the top leagues in such established footballing nations as Turkey, Russia, and Portugal."
"Starting with the 2008–09 season, a new third-level league, the 3. Liga, was launched, slotting between the 2. Bundesliga and the Regionalliga in the league pyramid. Unlike the Bundesligen, the 3. Liga is operated directly by the DFB. At the same time, the Regionalliga went from two divisions to three."
"One of the problems currently facing the league is in the performance and fate of clubs from the former East Germany, which are finding it difficult to compete with the wealthy, established western sides. One-time GDR clubs are unable to attract lucrative sponsorships, cannot afford the salaries needed to hold on to their ""homegrown"" talent, and find themselves playing in crumbling or primitive stadium facilities. Of the 36 clubs in the top two levels of the league system in the 2011–12 season, five are from the former East Germany, an increase of two from 2010–11. However, as in the previous two seasons, none will be in the First Bundesliga. The five former Eastern clubs in the 2. Bundesliga are Energie Cottbus, who last appeared in the First Bundesliga in 2008–09; Union Berlin, from the former East Berlin, who have been in the 2. Bundesliga since being promoted as champions of the inaugural season of the 3. Liga; Erzgebirge Aue, present since the 2010–11 season; Hansa Rostock, who immediately returned from a one-season stint in the 3. Liga; and Dynamo Dresden, making their first appearance at the second level in five years. Four other eastern clubs are playing in the 2011–12 3. Liga—Carl Zeiss Jena, Chemnitz, Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and the Potsdam club Babelsberg."
"In preparations for the 2006 World Cup, the DFB attempted to fairly balance the number of venues between the eastern and western halves of the country. However, the organization had to face up to the reality of there not being enough suitable facilities in the old DDR –not limited to stadiums, but including hotels, restaurants and other visitor needs, and transportation infrastructure–, with the result that the east finds itself underrepresented. Only one of the 2006 venues was in the former East Germany (in Leipzig). Similarly, only one of the nine venues for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, also held in Germany, was in the former East Germany (in Dresden). The situation fits into the broader context of the effects of German reunification on East Germany and the resentment that many Ossis feel for their western cousins."
"RB Leipzig is one notable club that produced a major resurgence of football in the former East Germany. This club saw several successive promotions in a short period of time and gained promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016–17 season. The club's success has been controversial. RB Leipzig was founded by initiative of drink company Red Bull GmbH, whose involvement in the club has sparked new discussions about commercialism in professional football."
"The 2012–13 season saw FC Bayern Munich become the first club ever to achieve the treble by winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and European Cup."
"Bayern Munich made German football history even further by earning a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title in 2016, and eventually became the first German club to attain more than four championships in succession by winning their fifth and sixth titles in 2017 and 2018 respectively for the club's 27th league title and their 28th nationally, both new records."
"Meanwhile, after 55 seasons, Hamburger SV was relegated from the Bundesliga to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history. During the 2017–18 season, a final day win over Gladbach was not enough to escape the drop as Wolfsburg won against Cologne. Hamburg had to endure a disastrous season under various managers after surviving two playouts in the preceding four seasons."
= = = Mona Mahmudnizhad = = =
"Mona Mahmudnizhad (, September 10, 1965 – June 18, 1983) was an Iranian Baháʼí who, in 1983 (together with nine other Baháʼí women) was sentenced to death and hanged in Shiraz, Iran. She was accused of being a member of the Baháʼí Faith."
"The official charges ranged from ""misleading children and youth"", to being a ""Zionist"" (because the Baháʼí World Centre is located in Israel)."
The non profit Mona Foundation focusing on girl's education was named after her in 2001.
"Mahmudnizhad was born on September 10, 1965, to Yad'u'llah and Farkhundeh Mahmudnizhad (who had left their home in Iran to teach their religion in Yemen)."
"In 1969 the government of Yemen expelled all foreigners and the Mahmudnizhad family returned to Iran. They spent two years in Isfahan, six months in Kermanshah and three years in Tabriz before finally settling in Shiraz in 1974. During this time her father repaired small appliances for work and served the Baháʼí community as part of various Baháʼí administrative bodies."
"While Baháʼís regularly faced persecution in Iran, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 reinforced this further. At 7:30pm on October 23, 1982, four armed Revolutionary Guards, sent by the public prosecutor of Shiraz, entered the Mahmudnizhad household and ransacked the home in search of Baháʼí material. They then took Mona and her father into custody. The two were blindfolded and taken to Seppah prison in Shiraz, where they were placed in separate quarters; Mahmudnizhad was detained in Seppah prison for a total of 38 days."
"On November 29, 1982, she and five other Baháʼí women were transferred from Seppah prison to Adelabad prison (also in Shiraz). After some time in Abelabad, she was transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Court where she was interrogated and placed back in prison."
"A few days later, she was once again interrogated in front of an Islamic Revolutionary judge. After these series of interrogations, which involved physical torture by being whipped on the soles of her feet with a cable, Mahmudnizhad was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. At the time of her sentencing, President of the United States Ronald Reagan, made a plea for clemency; despite this, the sentence of the 10 women was carried out on the night of June 18, 1983, at a nearby polo field."
The other women who were hanged with Mahmudnizhad were:
"In September 2007, the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center published a case study on the subject."
"Mahmudnizhad's story is the subject of several art works. Music artist Doug Cameron recreated Mahmudnizhad's story in a music video, ""Mona with the Children"", which made the pop charts in Canada (#14 for the week of October 19, 1985). The video was distributed throughout the music scene and was effective in bringing the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran to international public attention."

= = = John Baker White (Virginia) = = =
"John Baker White (August 4, 1794 – October 9, 1862) was a 19th-century American military officer, lawyer, court clerk, and civil servant in the U.S. state of Virginia."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark."
"During the American Civil War, White was concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury."
White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759–1831) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833–1915) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839–1917).
"John Baker White was born on August 4, 1794, near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White (1759–1831) and his wife Arabella Baker. Among his other relations, White was a great-great-nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738–1804) and a great-nephew of another United States House Representative, Francis White (1761–1826)."
"During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign."
"Following his service in the War of 1812, White settled in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814. On March 20, 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County, and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757."
"As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White conducted the teaching of jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P. White, and Philip B. Streit."
"In addition to his law instruction, White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society. When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1839, White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board ""occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability"", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats."
"By 1839, White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney. During the absence of the board's president, David Gibson, White served as president ""pro tempore"" from November 29 until December 13, 1839. The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White's tenure on its board of directors."
"Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E. M. Armstrong."
"White's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America, after which White supported the defense of Virginia's states' rights and of the United States Constitution. White's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army, and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause. Because of his Confederate sympathies, White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest."
"No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864, and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war. In 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White ""kept close watch over"" the county's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces. Later in the fall of 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney."
"Upon learning of this, White was again concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping. White selected for transport only the bound volumes of records which included ""deed books, wills, and settlements of estates"" and kept the unbound paper records in the courthouse, thus separating them so that the entirety of the county's records could not be destroyed by Union forces. White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records, as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together."
"In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed."
"Virginia City is a 1940 American Western film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Miriam Hopkins, Randolph Scott, and a mustachioed Humphrey Bogart in the role of the real-life outlaw John Murrell. Based on a screenplay by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Union officer who escapes from a Confederate prison and is sent to Virginia City from where his former prison commander is planning to send five million dollars in gold to Virginia to save the Confederacy. The film premiered in its namesake, Virginia City, Nevada. The film was shot in black and white (sepiatone)."
"Union officer Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) stages a daring escape from Confederate Libby Prison run by the commandant, Vance Irby (Randolph Scott). Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins), who unbeknownst to him is in fact a dance-hall entertainer — and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis (Charles Middleton) to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell (Humphrey Bogart), leader of a gang of ""banditos"", traveling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away."
"When the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town."
"While Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison."
"The rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery (Douglass Dumbrille), the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch."
"Bradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture."
"Drewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, ""as a soldier"", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but ""as a man"" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865."
"The day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln (Victor Kilian, seen only in silhouette) and pleads for Bradford's life. Lincoln reveals that at that very moment, Generals Lee and Grant are meeting at Appomattox Courthouse to end the war. As the war is over, and in a symbol of the reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln pardons Bradford in the spirit of his second inaugural address, ""With malice toward none; with charity for all..."""
"The film was a follow up to ""Dodge City"" although it has entirely new characters and was not a sequel, predating it by eight years in historical time. It was originally called ""Nevada"" and was to star basically the same director and cast as ""Dodge City"": Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Sheridan, Donald Crisp, Guinn Williams, and Alan Hale. The title was eventually changed to ""Virginia City"", which had been owned by RKO, but they agreed to give it to Warners."
"De Havilland dropped out and was replaced by Brenda Marshall. However, within a few weeks, Miriam Hopkins replaced her. Randolph Scott was hired to play Flynn's antagonist. Victor Jory was going to play the main villain, but had a scheduling conflict due to his appearance in ""Light of Western Stars"". He was replaced by Humphrey Bogart, requiring ""It All Came True"" to be pushed back."
"There was six weeks' filming based in Flagstaff, Arizona."
The film was given a gala premiere in Reno and Virginia City.
"Frank Nugent of ""The New York Times"", despite criticizing the acting talents of Flynn and Hopkins, wrote that ""there is enough concentrated action in [""Virginia City""], enough of the old-time Western sweep, to make it lively entertainment""."
"""Filmink"" magazine called it ""a big, expensive, noisy movie which aims for size and spectacle over, say, suspense and thrills – I don’t think director Michael Curtiz was any more excited by Westerns than Flynn, but both do professional jobs, as does Scott."""
"According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,518,000 domestically and $602,000 foreign."
"When the film was released in France in 1947, it became one of the most popular movies of the year."

"Born in the Mississippi city of Holly Springs, Vendig created ""The Edge of Night"" for Procter and Gamble Productions and CBS Daytime in 1956. He had been a writer on the ""Perry Mason"" radio show and when Erle Stanley Gardner refused to allow the show to become a soap opera, Vendig refashioned the show into ""The Edge of Night"", and brought actor John Larkin, who played Mason on the radio, to the show as series star Mike Karr. The character of Mike's daughter, Laurie Ann Karr, was named for Vendig's daughter Laurie Ann."
"Vendig was the series' head writer from 1956 until 1960, then co-head writer with James Gentile from 1960 until 1965. Vendig was credited on-air as series' creator until his departure from the daytime drama in 1965."

= = = Variable capacitor = = =
"A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors are often used in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners."
"In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed."
"The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (""rotor"") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (""stator"") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis. Air or plastic foils can be used as dielectric material."
"By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale. Various forms of reduction gear mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns."
"A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor, it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio, as well as high-powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced."

= = = Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources = = =
Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources is a 1983 biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by Martin Lings.
"The book provides a new account of the sira or the life of Muhammad, with details that had not been elaborated in other accounts. It is based primarily on old Arab sources that go back to the 9th century, of which some passages are translated for the first time. It is not contradictory to other accounts but rather offers new insights and new details. The book also includes excerpts from original English translations of speeches by men and women who lived close to Muhammad, heard him speak, witnessed his actions, witnessed the way he interacted with situations and witnessed events he encountered throughout various stages of his life."
"References used are Ibn Ishaq (references here are to Ferdinand Wüstenfeld's edition of Sirat Rasul Allah, a life of the Prophet by Muhammad ibn Ishaq in the annotated recension of Ibn Hisham). Also Ibn Sa’ad (the references are to John Leyden's edition of Kitab al-Tabaqat al Kabir by Muhammad ibn Sa’d). Also there is Al-Waqidi (and the references are to Marsden Jones' edition of Kitab al Maghazi, A Chronicle of the Prophet's Campaigns, by Muhammad ibn Umar al- Waqidi)."
"It is a narrative of the history of Arabia and the birth and the life of Muhammad. The biography consists of 85 short chapters, some as short as just two pages in length. Each chapter deals with an important event in the history of Islam and provides chronological context for the advent of the religion, as well as detailed information about Muhammad."
"The biography has gone through many reprints in English and it has been translated and published into many languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Malay and Tamil."
"A distinctive element of the biography is the vivid, approachable narrative style, which is fast moving and flows fluently. The book reads more like a novel and was written in a style, which is easily readable, comprehensible and it uses language, which reflects both simplicity and grandeur."
"Lings uses a more archaic style of English to depict conversations and translations of the Qur'an, which helps slows down the rapid flow of the narration. The focus in the book is less about the teachings of Islam and more about Muhammad."
"In 1991, a second revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, containing additional details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavours as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighbouring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Before Lings died in 2005, a newly revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, which included final updates made on the text and incorporated into its contents, containing extra details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavors as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighboring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Hamza Yusuf hails this work as ""one of the great biographies of the English language"", praising ""the historical accuracy of the text and the providential care so evident in the author's choice of versions as well as the underlying structure of the story as he chose to tell it."" He also reports from Lings how while writing this book, ""he was overwhelmed with the presence of the Prophet during the entire time and felt a great blessing in having been able to complete it.""."
"""The Spectator"" described the book as ""an enthralling story that combines impeccable scholarship with a rare sense of the sacred worthy of his subject."" ""The Islamic Quarterly"" called the book ""a true work of art, as enthralling as the best novels with the difference that this is not fiction but fact."""
"""The Times"" said ""this work is widely recognized as the most readable account of the life of the Prophet to date."" ""Parabola"" stated that ""for those interested in Islam in one way or another, it is mesmerizing."""
"Upon its first edition, the book was subject to criticism by some Muslims who decried the ""Perennialist poison"" in the book. The author gave public answer in a Saudi newspaper to the objections."

"On 23 October 2014, Connecting Sydney was announced as the preferred bidder. The contract was finalised in December 2014, when it was also announced that the consortium had been renamed ALTRAC Light Rail, and that the opening date had been brought forward to early 2019. The contract also included the operation and maintenance of the Inner West Light Rail from mid-2015."
"Major construction commenced on 23 October 2015, beginning in the section of George Street between King and Market Streets. To minimise disruption along the length of the corridor, works were staggered across 31 construction zones. The first section of track in the CBD was laid in December 2016, by which time a total of 410 metres of track had already been laid across the project. This increased to around 5 kilometres of track by May 2017. By October 2017, track installation reached the halfway mark, with 12,000 metres of track laid at 23 of the 31 zones along the alignment."
"The CBD and South East Light Rail required significant changes to the bus networks of the Sydney central business district and the Eastern Suburbs. Prior to construction of the light rail, Hillsbus and State Transit bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey."
"To accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including Elizabeth, Castlereagh, Park, Druitt, Clarence and York Streets. Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as Railway Square, Queen Victoria Building and King Street Wharf. A small number of routes were either combined so that they run through the CBD without terminating, removed from the CBD entirely or completely discontinued."
"Construction suffered from significant delays. Major construction of the project was due to conclude in April 2018, though finishing works were to continue for some time after."
"Delays at two zones in the CBD were announced in August 2016. Originally meant to be completed before Christmas 2016, construction work at these zones was to continue for several months longer than originally anticipated. The zones were eventually opened around a year after the planned completion date. Further delays to the project arose during 2016."
"By the beginning of 2018 the whole project was significantly behind schedule. In March 2018 – one month before major works were originally due to be completed – the Transport Minister declined to put a date on when he expected construction of the line to be finished, but noted the government was ""an unhappy customer"" of the ALTRAC consortium."
The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure – the construction company delivering the line – had deteriorated with a dispute arising between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design. Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion. Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020.
"In October 2018, Acciona announced further delays to the project, stating that it would not be completed until May 2020."
"In June 2019, TfNSW and ALTRAC (including Acciona) reached an agreement to resolve their commercial issues and legal claims. As part of the agreement, the PPP was extended to 2036, with the government to pay up to $576 million over the duration of an extended PPP term, and ALTRAC shareholders to invest additional equity into the project to meet costs. The settlement package resolved over $1.5 billion of legal claims between TfNSW and ALTRAC, and Acciona withdrew its $1.1 billion legal misrepresentation claim against the government. The agreement also included milestone and incentive payments for light rail services to commence in two stages, with target start dates of December 2019 between Randwick and Circular Quay, and March 2020 between Kingsford and Circular Quay."
"Separate to the light rail budget, Randwick City Council earmarked $68 million to partially mitigate the impacts of the light rail. Projects include replacing some of the car parking spaces that were lost, especially in Kingsford, works to improve traffic flow in the district and public domain works."
"The City of Sydney planned to provide $220 million towards the light rail project. This would include money for public domain works on George Street and surrounding laneways. The centrepiece of these works was to be a large arch structure known as Cloud Arch located outside the Sydney Town Hall, however it was cancelled in late 2018 after cost blowouts. Cloud Arch would have acted as a gateway to the pedestrian section of George Street, with trams passing underneath it."
"In February 2018, testing of the line commenced on a short section of the Randwick branch along Alison Road. Testing along the rest of the Randwick branch and the main line to Circular Quay was achieved in August 2019, while the Kingsford branch, which will open three months later than the rest of the line, commenced testing in October 2019."
There have been criticism of the project from some parties:
"The first L2 passenger service between Circular Quay and Randwick commenced just after 10 AM on 14 December 2019. The opening weekend (14 and 15 December 2019) was fare-free, and 115,000 people used the new tram service during the opening weekend. The launch of the service on 14 December was interrupted by a tram which broke down at Circular Quay around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, within hours of the official opening ceremony. Services were restored by 3:30 PM."
"L3 passenger services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford will commence in March 2020. In the interim until then, to maintain the frequency of light rail services in the CBD, L2 services run between Circular Quay and Central Chalmers Street. When the Kingsford branch opens, these services are expected to continue beyond Central Chalmers Street towards Juniors Kingsford as L3 services."
"The project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) released in 2013 proposed a redesigned bus network in the CBD and the Eastern Suburbs. Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted. Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the University of New South Wales to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus."
The proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:
"Some bus changes had been made to bus routes in the list since 2013. For example, route 343 currently runs as a through route between Kingsford and Chatswood without terminating at the CBD, and UNSW routes had been reconfigured as bus routes 891, 893 and 898."
The final bus network will be announced in due time and changes to bus services will be implemented four to six weeks after the commencement of L3 Kingsford Line services in March 2020.
"As a member of the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium, Transdev will operate the line until the end of the PPP, set to end at 2036. Services on the Randwick branch are numbered L2 and services on the Kingsford branch are numbered L3."
"The service is operated by 60 five-section Alstom Citadis X05 trams operating in coupled pairs. The first was completed in May 2017, arriving at the Randwick depot on 28 July 2017."
"The line commences outside Circular Quay station heading west on Alfred Street, before proceeding south down George Street, then east via Rawson Place and Eddy Avenue, and south via Chalmers Street to Central station. It then continues east via Devonshire Street over the Eastern Distributor and under Moore Park and Anzac Parade via a tunnel before heading south via the former bus right of way. At the intersection of Anzac Parade and Alison Road the splits into two branches, L3 (to open in March 2020) continues down Anzac Parade to terminate outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club at Kingsford, and the L2 branch goes to Randwick via Alison Road, Wansey Road and High Street."

= = = Eight-legged essay = = =
"The eight-legged essay (, literally ""eight share text"") was a style of essay that exam-takers wrote to pass the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in these civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often focusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in innovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the eight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to write coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates were expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value was also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material. This was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it were better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the history of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have caused China's ""cultural stagnation and economic backwardness"" in the 19th century."
"The eight-legged essay is named so because it was divided into eight sections, which are ""breaking open the topic (破题)"", ""receiving the topic (承题)"", ""beginning discussion (起讲)"", ""initial leg (起股)"", ""middle leg (中股)“, ""later leg (后股)"", ""final leg (束股), ""conclusion (大结)."""
"The eight-legged essay format was invented in the Song Dynasty, by reformer and poet Wang Anshi (1021–1086), in the eleventh century. During the Song Dynasty, due to the invention of the printing press and the emperors' wish to recruit more men of talent, there was a huge boost in education and a consequent increase in the number of people taking the civil service exam. Additionally, there was a shift from a pluralistic ideology characteristic of the Tang Dynasty to a neo-Confucian ideology based on Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi's philosophy. The eight-legged essay came into existence under this background, coinciding with the shift in ideology and embodying the new orthodoxy."
"The essay format didn't become prevalent as a standard essay in the civil service examination until early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the composition of the essay was clearly specified. In the seventeenth century, Gu Yanwu stated that this form of essay-writing became standardized precisely during the 15th century, when the eight parts of the essay were determined. The term ""eight-legged essay"" formally appeared during the early years of the Chenghua Emperor's reign (1464–1487) for the first time. Then, it started to be required in civil service examinations in the 1480s."
"Since mastery of the form was a requirement for success in the examinations, commercial printers during the Ming Dynasty began to print successful examination essays as guides for aspiring candidates. The first of these appeared in pirated form during the 16th century, and the practice gained official approval in 1587, when the government suggested that the best papers of the previous century be reprinted as examples."
"There was widespread dissatisfaction with the eight-legged essay during the Qing Dynasty. In the beginning of the Kangxi reign, the state under the rule of the Four Regents issued an order revoking the need to use ""baguwen"" in all civil service exams, although the order was later repealed. The Qianlong Emperor said that he could not comprehend the eight-legged essays written by many exam-takers. The eight-legged essay was abolished in 1905 by the Guangxu Emperor. In total, the eight-legged essay was included in China's civil service examination for over 1,000 years and thus assumed a historically important role."
"Structurally and stylistically, the eight-legged essay was restrictive and rigid. There are rules governing different sections of the essay, including restrictions on the number of sentences in total, the number of words in total, the format and structure of the essay, and rhyming techniques. The requirement of length went from 550 words to 700 at one point."
"In terms of the content, the exam-takers were required to compose their essays under a pre-assigned title and rhyming word, around which they needed to rhyme their essays or poems. Writers were also advised to circumvent the use of offensive vocabulary and clues that can point to their identity or social status."
"The components of the essay were usually in a consistent format, although there were variations; in particular:"
"The following is a translation of an original eight-legged essay, written by Wang Ao (1450–1524), who was considered to be a master of the form."

The school occupied the third floor of the school building built in 1952 and through the years has prided itself on serving a relatively small school population. In order to better meet its educational goals, the school was recognized with a NYS Board of Regents Charter in 1965 and with an additional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 2003, which was recently renewed."

However, she was not a successful design and she only participated in the Winter War and during the first months of the Continuation War. She was stricken from the navy lists in 1942, due to extensive wear damage on the hull. She was moored at Suomenlinna and was scrapped after the war."
= = = Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record = = =
Entheogenic drugs have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
"historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens, chemical substances used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context."
"A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old."
"The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia."
"The Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:"
"The Maya (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way."
"The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b, ""Mushroom Stones of Middle America,"" in Mushrooms, Russia and History by Valentina P. Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson, eds. N.T.)"
Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:
"""My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following""...(see Shook, E.M. & Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology & History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )"
The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendants of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.
"The Aztec entheogenic complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods,"" a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs."
"There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences."
"During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the ""Flower Burial"" in Shanidar Cave, a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from Tassili, Algeria cave paintings depicting ""Psilocybe mairei"" mushrooms dated 7000 to 9000 years before present. From this region, there are several therianthropic images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited effect of many psychedelic drugs, Ego death or unity). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom."
"There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired."
"A cave painting in Spain has been interpreted as depicting ""Psilocybe hispanica""."

"The 7-demicubic honeycomb, or demihepteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 7-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 7-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 7-cubes become alternated into 7-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 7-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,4} facets."
"The vertex arrangement of the 7-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 84 vertices of the rectified 7-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""7-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 84 of this lattice. The best known is 126, from the E lattice and the 3 honeycomb."
"The D packing (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two ""D lattices"". The D packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2=64 (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8)."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four 7-demicubic lattices: It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 14 (""2n"" for n≥5) and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb, , containing all with tritruncated 7-orthoplex, Voronoi cells."

= = = Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy = = =
"Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy or Majjari Narasimha Reddy (24 November 1806 – 2 February 1847) was an Indian freedom fighter. Son of a former Telugu Palegaadu Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ""Vadde Obanna"" were at the heart of the rebellion against British in 1846, where 5,000 peasants rose up against the British East India Company in Kurnool district, Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished."
"The father of Narasimha Reddy was related to the Polygar (jagirdarr) family of Uyyalawada in Koilkuntla taluk who had married two daughters of the Polygar of Nossam. He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest. His first wife was Siddamma."
"The EIC's introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 Permanent Settlement, which had first been enacted in Bengal Presidency ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so."
"The Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system ""represented the decadent social order"", were in many cases ""upstarts"" and ""were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages"". These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the Polygar Wars. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates."
"The changes, which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximise revenue, deprived village headmen and other higher-status people of their role as revenue collectors and position as landholders, while also impacting on lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished. The population came to the view that the British were taking their wealth and that those who were dependent on the traditional system no longer had a means of making a living. As the old order collapsed into disarray, the once-authoritative Polygars, including Narasimha Reddy, became the focus of attention from sufferers, whose pleas fell on deaf British ears. The Polygars saw a chance to mobilize peasant opposition both for genuine social reasons."
"Narasimha Reddy's own objections too was based on their outcomes. Compared to the Polygar of Nossam, the pension awarded to his family upon their dispossession was paltry and the authorities refused to increase it by redistributing some of the Nossam monies when that latter family became extinct in 1821. At the same time, some of his relatives were facing proposals for further reductions in their land rights, including by a reform of the village policing system."
"Things came to a head 1846 when the British authorities assumed land rights previously held by various people who had died in the villages of Goodladurty, Koilkuntla and Nossum. Encouraged by the discontent of others, Reddy became the figurehead for an uprising."
"An armed group, initially comprising those dispossessed of inam lands around Koilkuntla, was led by Reddy's Right-hand man Vadde Obanna in July 1846. The Acting Collector for the area Lord Cochrane, believed that Reddy had material support from fellow pensioners in Hyderabad and Kurnool, whose land rights had also been appropriated. The group soon attracted support from the peasantry and was reported by British authorities to have rampaged in Koilkuntla, looting the treasury there and evading the police before killing several officers at Mittapally. They also plundered Rudravaram before moving to an area near to Almore, pursued by the British military forces who then surrounded them."
"A battle between Obanna's 5000-strong band and a much smaller British contingent then took place, with around 200 of the rebels being killed and others captured before they were able to break out in the direction of Kotakota, Giddalur where Reddy's family were situated. Having collected his family, he and the rest of the rebels moved into the Nallamala Hills. The British offered incentives for information regarding the rebels, who were again surrounded amidst reports that unrest was now growing in other villages of the area. In a further skirmish between the rebels and the British, who had sent for reinforcements, 40–50 rebels were killed and 90 were captured, including Reddy. Although there was no evidence of Obanna's capture, he most possibly was also a captive along with his leader."
"Warrants were issued for the arrest of nearly 1,000 of the rebels, of which 412 were released without charge. A further 273 were bailed and 112 were convicted. Reddy, too, was convicted and in his case received the death penalty. On 22 February 1847, he was executed in Koilkuntla in front of a silent crowd of over 2000 people."
British kept his head on the fort wall in public view until 1877. The East India Company reported in their district manual of 1886 that
"The Renati Surya Chandrula Smaraka Samithi was formed to preserve the memory of Reddy and the philanthropist Budda Vengal Reddy, both of whom were born in Uyyalawada village. The committee published a book in both Telugu and English, titled ""Renati Surya Chandrulu"" (""The Sun and Moon of Renadu""), in 2015. It contains excerpts from research papers by historians."
"A movie based on Narasimha Reddy's inspiring life, ""Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy"" directed by Surender Reddy and starring Chiranjeevi was released in the Telugu film industry on 2 October 2019. He was referred as a dacoit by British as he was helping people"

= = = Boomer Sooner = = =
"""Boomer Sooner"" is the fight song for the University of Oklahoma (OU). The lyrics were written in 1905 by Arthur M. Alden, an OU student and son of a local jeweler in Norman. The tune is taken from ""Boola Boola"", the fight song of Yale University (which was itself borrowed from an 1898 song called ""La Hoola Boola"" by Robert Allen (Bob) Cole and Billy Johnson). A year later, an additional section was appended, borrowed from the University of North Carolina's ""I'm a Tar Heel Born""."
"The phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" refers to the Land Run of 1889, in which the land around the modern university was settled. ""Boomers"" were people who campaigned for the lands to be opened (or tried to enter the lands) before passage of the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889. ""Sooners"" were land thieves who settled before the lands were officially opened, giving them an unfair advantage on finding, fencing, and claiming farm land. If the charge of early entry was proven, they would lose their claimed land."
"The OU marching band plays the fight song when the team takes the field and when the team scores a touchdown, a field goal, makes a big play, or makes a play in general. They also play it along with other fight songs while the Oklahoma defense is on the field to encourage the crowd to get loud. Some fans have informally counted it being played between 70 and 90 times a game."
"ESPN writer Doug Ward has called the combined effect of ""Boomer Sooner"" and OU's horse-drawn Sooner Schooner wagon ""as potent a one-two fight song/mascot punch as you'll find in college football."""
"On October 15, 1983 the University of Oklahoma football team visited Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Sooner squad played poorly at first, and within 10 minutes Oklahoma State was winning by a score of 20-3. A policeman escorted Gene Thrailkill, the Oklahoma band director, off the field for not having a sideline pass. Before he was forced to leave, Thrailkill shouted to the band members, ""I want you to start playing and don't stop 'til the team's ahead!"" The band complied, and played ""Boomer Sooner"" non-stop roughly 300 times. The team responded by scoring 15 unanswered points against Oklahoma State. After an OSU fumble with 1:17 left in the game, Oklahoma scored a field goal to win 21-20. OU coach Barry Switzer awarded the game ball to the band (known as ""The Pride of Oklahoma"") for the non-stop effort and labeled it ""The Day The Pride Won""."
"AEW commentator and Oklahoma native Jim Ross uses the fight song as his entrance theme. He also often uses the phrase ""Boomer Sooner"" to signify a good moment."
"In recent years, ""Boomer Sooner"" has been adopted as a chant at Sooner football and basketball games. One side of Owen Field or the Lloyd Noble Center chants ""Boomer!"" with the other side chanting ""Sooner!"" The chant has frequently been heard at recent Heisman Trophy presentations, led by 1978 Heisman winner Billy Sims."
"The tune of the song is also used for Albania's popular national song, ""Shqipëri, atdhe i dashur!"" (""Albania, dear fatherland!""), also known as the Alphabet Hymn. The tune was borrowed by Parashqevi Qiriazi, who penned patriotic lyrics to fit it, after the historic Congress of Manastir which decided the Albanian alphabet."
= = = Larry Tanenbaum = = =
Lawrence M. Tanenbaum (born 1945) is a Canadian businessman and chairman of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). He owns a 25% stake in MLSE through his holding company Kilmer Sports Inc.
"Tanenbaum was born to a Jewish family, son of Max (owner of York Steel) and Anne Tanenbaum. and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Cornell University in 1968."
"The family's patriarch, Abraham Tanenbaum, left Parczew, Poland, north of Lublin, for New York in 1911. Two Toronto-bound friends from the same town persuaded Abraham to join them. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Abraham was driving a horse and cart through residential and industrial areas of Toronto looking for scrap metal. By 1914, just before the war in Europe, Abraham had saved enough to bring his wife, Chippa Sura, and two young sons Joseph and Max to accompany him in Toronto. Abraham prospered and constructed the Runnymede Iron and Steel Company into a major steel fabrication company and real estate empire. His son, Max, who founded his own company, York Steel, had seven children, among them Larry, who studied economics at Cornell University."
"Tanenbaum is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as president and CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction, Kilmer developed into a multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer's road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer's wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited."
"Tanenbaum served as chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada's largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren's activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America's largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As a result of this merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the board and chaired its finance committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA."
"Today, Kilmer's roots in construction are expressed through innovative real estate development and leading edge public private partnerships (P3). Its Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund reclaims contaminated land in the urban context, through sophisticated risk management and optimizing for highest and best use. Its Kilmer Developments is currently managing three P3's: The Quickload Container Examination Facility in Prince Rupert, B.C.; the 20 Ontario Highway Service Centre locations under the ONroute banner, in partnership with HMS Host and Canadian Tire; and in partnership with Dream, designed, financed and constructed the 2015 Pan Am Games Athletes’ Village, which has been converted into condominiums as part of the Canary District Project. Kilmer is also part of the consortium that has acquired the passenger terminal operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport."
"Kilmer has a long history of private equity investment, beginning in 1975 as a significant shareholder of CUC Broadcasting, where Tanenbaum served on the board of directors and the executive committee of the company. At the time of its sale in 1994 CUC was Canada's fifth largest cable company, with operations that included paging, publishing, satellite, and radio broadcasting."
"Most recently, Kilmer, in partnership with Heartland Coca-Cola Bottling out of Kansas, acquired the Coca-Cola bottling and distribution operations for all of Canada. The new operation, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Limited, is owned by Tanbridge Partners LP, of which Tanenbaum is co-chairman."
"Kilmer's other current private equity investments include Chaleur Sawmills Limited Partnership, Fornebu Lumber Company Inc. and Cypress Five Star Inc., the Canadian franchisee of Five Guys Burgers and Blaze Pizza."
"In addition to its direct investing activities, in 2000 Kilmer founded Kilmer Capital Partners Limited, a private equity investment fund manager, which established two funds to provide equity capital to small and mid-market companies. Tanenbaum is chairman of Kilmer Capital. Kilmer Capital's investments have included Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp., McGregor Industries Inc., Unisync Corp. Inc., Vansco Electronics Ltd., Atelka Enterprises Inc., Altasciences Inc., Compact Power Inc. and Tribal Sportswear."
"Tanenbaum recently served as a member of the advisory council, Toronto Board of Trade. He also served as a member of the Ontario Investment and Trade Advisory Council; as a member of the advisory committee, Toronto Prosperity Initiative; and as a member of the independent fiscal review panel of the City of Toronto; and the Mayor's Economic Competitiveness Advisory Committee of the City of Toronto."
"Tanenbaum has had a long-standing interest in the sports and entertainment area and to that end in 1991 he spearheaded the effort to bring an NBA franchise to Toronto. In 1996 an interest was acquired in the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and arena. In 1998 Tanenbaum was an active force in the acquisition of the Toronto Raptors basketball team and the Scotiabank Arena, which, with the Toronto Maple Leafs formed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Tanenbaum is chairman of MLSE, chairman of the board of the National Basketball Association, and a governor and member of the executive committee of the National Hockey League, the NBA, and Major League Soccer (Toronto FC professional soccer club, which MLSE also owns). He is Co-Chair – Toronto 2026 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario."
"Allen Gamble and Terry ""Yankee Clipper"" Hoitz are both detectives of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Allen is a mild-mannered forensic accountant while Terry is a hot-tempered detective who has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. They receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin and Fosse. All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson and P. K. Highsmith, who are considered New York City's best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after attempting to ""aim for the bushes"", which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place."
Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover the losses incurred by his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman has hired a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley to make sure Ershon pays her back.
"During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that he was ever a pimp. When they both get to Allen's house, Terry develops a slight crush on Allen's wife Sheila, while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit Allen's ex-girlfriend, Christinith, to gain their police evidence, she and her husband wants him to have sex with her. When Sheila tells Allen that she is pregnant, he reverts to his dark personality, which has her kick him out of their house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancée Francine, who had walked out on him due to his furious attitude."
"Their investigation comes to a halt when Ershon's attorney, Don Beaman, learns of Ershon's plan to cover his losses, leading Wesley to kill him and make it look like a suicide. Angered at their lack of progress, Capt. Gene Mauch splits up Allen and Terry, sending Terry to traffic duty and Allen to beat patrol. Despite Terry's anger, Allen still works the case on his own. After Allen learns that Danson and Highsmith died investigating a staged theft during which Wesley broke into an accounting firm next door, he finds credible evidence and earns his gun back from Mauch. Allen then convinces Terry to rejoin him. They meet Capt. Mauch at Bed Bath & Beyond, his second job, where the police captain admits he has been holding off on the case because Ershon has high-profile connections that could ruin him, and he allows them to finish the case off-the-books."
"They go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realize that the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. They escape with Ershon to his private apartment, and Ershon tells them that the money for the pension fund is already in his account, ready to be transferred. Later that night, Allen and Terry finally reconcile with their loved ones. Allen apologizes to Sheila with her mother as a secret communication system and so she welcomes her husband back in. Terry also apologizes to Francine for letting his anger rule his life."
"The next morning, they drive to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police officers who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV."
"McKay described the genesis as an ""accident, in a way"", stemming from a dinner he and Ferrell had with Wahlberg. After noticing the actors' chemistry, McKay wrote producer Kevin Messick an email hypothesizing a possible film starring the two, giving a cop film as an example of what he thought would work. Messik suggested developing that idea into a film."
"Principal photography for the film began on September 23, 2009, in New York City. Additional scenes were filmed in Albany and Staten Island, New York."
"Practical visual effects work, including the helicopter crash scene, was done by KernerFX."
"Stunt coordinator Brad Martin said in a ""Wall Street Journal"" interview that for Gamble's car they used three Priuses, including one with a racing engine so large it had to go in the back seat."
"In July 2010, Wahlberg and Ferrell appeared at the San Diego Comic-Con International to promote the film."
"During an episode of ""Big Brother"", the house guests competed in a luxury challenge to see an advance screening of the film. Although they weren't actually in the house, both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg made an on-screen video appearance."
"During the August 4, 2010 episode of ""America's Got Talent"", the week's contestants saw an advance screening of the film and got to meet both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg."
"Ferrell and Wahlberg also made a cameo appearance on an episode of ""WWE Raw"" to promote the film."

"""The Other Guys"" received a 78% approval rating from 202 surveyed critics on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes; the site's critical consensus reads: ""A clever parody of cop-buddy action-comedies, ""The Other Guys"" delivers several impressive action set pieces and lots of big laughs, thanks to the assured comic chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg."" It has been called ""a highly entertaining movie filled with witty dialogue and over-the-top action."" Peter Travers of ""Rolling Stone"" praised the film, saying, ""Don't let anyone spoil the wildly hilarious surprises. Ferrell and Wahlberg will double your fun. Guaranteed."" Some critics praised ""The Other Guys"" as the best police film of the year, comparing the film to the critically panned ""Cop Out"", with Richard Roeper stating, ""Note to Kevin Smith: THIS is how you do a spoof of the buddy-cop genre,"" and Stephen Whitty of ""The Star-Ledger"" said in his mixed review, ""Measured against this year's other police farce—remember ""Cop Out""?—it looks absolutely heroic."""

"Birds of the West Indies () is a book containing exhaustive coverage of the 400+ species of birds found in the Caribbean Sea, excluding the ABC islands, and Trinidad and Tobago, which are considered bio-geographically as part of South America."
"Written by ornithologist James Bond, the book was first published as ""A Field Guide to the Birds of the West Indies"" in 1936 by the Academy of Natural Sciences as part of the ""International Series"". It has been reprinted several times since then, including as one of the Peterson Field Guides series (PFG 18), a September 1, 1999, edition from Houghton Mifflin and a March 4, 2002 edition from Collins. The book contains approximately 256 pages."
"The book was the only text exclusively devoted to the avifauna of the region for many decades until ""A Guide to the Birds of the West Indies"" (), by Herbert Raffaele et al.., was published in 1998."
"""Birds of the West Indies"" was a book owned by novelist Ian Fleming, who used the ornithologist's name for his own fictional British secret agent character, Commander James Bond. Fleming, a keen bird watcher while living at his estate in Jamaica, owned this book. He later explained that the author's name was ""brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon, and yet very masculine – just what I needed."" Fleming once said in a ""Reader's Digest"" interview: ""I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, and 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."" The book has since become a collector's item amongst Bond fans and was featured as an homage in the twentieth James Bond film, ""Die Another Day"", when Bond poses as an ornithologist while in Cuba. The final shot of the miniseries """" is of a copy of ""Birds of the West Indies"" next to Ian Fleming's typewriter."
= = = Large format lens = = =
Large format lenses are photographic optics that provide an image circle large enough to cover large format film or plates. Large format lenses are typically used in large format cameras and view cameras.
Photographic optics generally project a circular image behind the lens. On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare. Large format lenses are an exception. For large format use the circular patch of image light usually extends beyond the minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film. The extra image offers room to spare to make use of camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film.
"Lenses of the same general construction are often given a name implying this design. For example, a Tessar always has four elements in three groups as described below, although Tessars have been produced with different focal lengths and maximum apertures for many decades. Sometimes a name does not identify a specific design; Kodak's Ektar lens brand name encompasses many different types. Sometimes different manufacturers use different names for lenses of the same type; for example the Voigtländer Skopar is of Tessar design. And sometimes identical lenses are sold under different names and at different prices; for example, lenses branded as Rodenstock and Caltar."

"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) is an Indonesian survey and political consultancy institution. It was founded in 2005 by a group of public opinion makers, researchers, columnists and survey experts. LSI is active in committing political surveys, for example during the General Election (Pemilu) or District Head General Election (Pilkada). In 2011, Universitas Kristen Indonesia (UKI) awarded LSI an “Achievement Award” since it was judged that LSI has provided significant contribution to the field of social science, political communication, and election politics in Indonesia."
"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia is often made a study subject and even the place where foreign politicians conduct their comparative studies. At the end of 2010 a delegation of US Congress led by Zack Hudgins conducted a meeting with Lingkaran Survei Indonesia. That meeting was a part of their chain of political activities in Indonesia aside from visiting various other institutions such as the People's Representative Council (DPR), political parties, and other elite entities of Indonesian politics. The reasoning behind that meeting was stated as due to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia being considered as an influential political institution in Indonesia, especially as its role as the pioneer of such form of institution in Indonesia."
"According to Tempo Newspaper, LSI was founded in 2005 by Denny JA. Before founding LSI, Denny founded Lembaga Survei Indonesia and served as its Director. Denny JA founded Lingkaran Survei Indonesia as a statement that a survey and consultancy institution can be profitable. The Swa Sembada Magazine wrote that Denny wished to build an institution not only focusing on committing political survey but can also perform political consultancy. Armed with the experience of securing the victory for the team that made Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's claim to presidency possible in 2004, Denny JA founded LSI with the focus of doing political surveys as well as providing political consultancy for political parties and candidates."
"As survey institution, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) provides aid for political parties and individuals in mapping their own strengths and weaknesses. Various political parties, such as Partai Golkar, have used LSI's survey results as consideration in choosing which candidates should be supported in District Head General Election (Pilkada.) As political consultant, LSI's first client was Ismeth Abdullah, who was elected as Governor of Riau Islands in 2005. Afterwards, LSI has provided aid to various clients from legislative members to district head candidates. Until 2013, LSI worked with 24 governors and 55 mayors/regents who were later elected."
"Currently, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) has developed six subsidiaries: Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI), Konsultan Citra Indonesia (KCI), Lingkaran Survei Kebijakan Publik (LSKP), Citra Publik Indonesia (CPI), Citra Publik Advertising (CPA), and Citra Komunikasi LSI (Cikom)."
"From 2004 to 2012, LSI conducted over 800 voter behavioral surveys across Indonesia for a variety of clients, including political parties, presidential candidates, legislative bodies candidates and district head candidates. Republika Newspaper even deigned the title of “Political Foreseer” to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) due to its ability to predict the correct victors on various elections far before the real results are announced and published. Museum Rekor Indonesia (MURI—Indonesian Museum of Records) awarded five awards to LSI due to its accuracy in predicting various election results: (1) The 1st Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions for 2005's District Head Election on the Riau Province, (2) The 1st Accurate Advertised Legislative Election Survey Prediction on 2009, (3) The 1st Accurate Advertised Presidential Election Survey Predictions on 2009, (4) The Most Amount of Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions of District Head Elections in One Season of District Head Election (13 elections from 2005 to 2008), (5) The Research Institute with the Most 100% Accurately Predicted Surveys in One Month, (6) correct predictions on March 2006"
"LSI began work as a political consultant in 2005. After LSI, similar institutions emerged, including Indobarometer, Fox Indonesia, Polmark Indonesia and Milenium Cipta Citra."
"The Irish ""long fhada"" seems, from contemporary sources, to have resembled its West Highland equivalent, though there is as yet no archaeological confirmation."
"The ""Annals of the Four Masters"" record the use of fleets in an Irish context, often with a Scottish connection. In 1413 Tuathal Ó Máille, returning from Ulster to Connacht with seven ships, encountered a severe storm (""anfadh na mara"") which drove them northwards to Scotland: only one of the ships survived. In 1433 Macdonald of the Isles arrived in Ulster with a large fleet (""co c-cobhlach mór"") to assist the O'Neills in a war with the O'Donnells."
"In Ireland oared vessels were employed extensively for warfare and piracy by the O'Malleys and the O'Flathertys, western lords whose base was in Connacht. English officials found it necessary to counter them with similar vessels. The most famous of these local rulers was Gráinne Ní Mháille, of whom Sir Richard Bingham reported in 1591 that she had twenty vessels at her command. She, like her father, was engaged in extensive seaborne trade."
"There was constant maritime traffic between Ireland and Scotland, and Highland mercenaries were commonly transported by birlinn to Ireland."
"The birlinn, when rowed, was distinguished by its speed, and could often evade pursuers as a result. No cannon were mounted even in the later period: the birlinn was too lightly built and its freeboard was too low. It was highly suitable for raiding, however, and with experienced marksmen on board, could mount a formidable defence against small craft."
Vessels of this type were at their most vulnerable when beached or when cornered by a heavier vessel carrying cannon.
"There is some evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century new influences were affecting birlinn design. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows ""fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre"" with vessels one-masted as before but with a square sail mounted on a sloping yard arm and a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. The supporting evidence has been criticised for being slight and unconvincing, but there is pictorial evidence for similar developments in the Irish galley."
= = = Botts' dots = = =
"Botts' dots (turtles in Washington and Oregon or buttons in Texas and other southern states) are round non-reflective raised pavement markers. In many parts of the US and other countries, Botts' dots are used, along with reflective raised pavement markers, to mark lanes on highways and arterial roads. They provide tactile and auditory feedback to drivers when moving across designated travel lanes, and are analogous to rumble strips."
"Botts' dots are named after Elbert Dysart Botts, a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) engineer credited with overseeing the research that led to the development of the markers."
Botts' dots are most commonly white but may be yellow when used to substitute for the yellow lines that divide opposing directions of traffic in North America. The dots are made of various ceramic materials or plastics such as polyester.
"On some roads, lanes are marked only with a mix of Botts' dots and conventional reflective markers, eliminating the need to repaint lane divider lines. Botts' dots are rarely used in regions with substantial snowfall, because snow plows damage or dislodge them."
"Caltrans engineers may have studied the concept of raised pavement markers as early as 1936. However, the department did not commence research in earnest until 1953, when the postwar economic boom resulted in an alarming increase in the number of cars and car accidents in California. Painted lines tended to become invisible during rain."
"The initial dots were made of glass and were attached to the road by nails or tacks, as suggested by Botts. The nails were soon abandoned: his team discovered that when the dots popped loose under stress, the nails punctured tires. Contrary to a common myth, the published record does not make clear whether Botts invented the famous epoxy that solved the problem; some sources indicate that one of his protégés was responsible for the epoxy. In September 1966, the California State Legislature mandated that Botts' dots be used for lane markings for all state highways in all non-snowfall areas."
"Today, there are more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor. In 2017, Caltrans announced that it would stop using Botts' dots as the sole indicator of lane division, due to cost and worker safety, and in order to make roadways more compatible with self-driving cars. Reflective lane markings will be wider and thicker, providing some of the tactile feedback the Botts' dots provided. In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots. Reflective Stimsonite pavement markers are placed at regular intervals between Botts' dots to increase the visibility of lane markings at night. In the Las Vegas area of southern Nevada, roads with multiple lanes use four pavement markers for each broken white line, a reflective Stimsonite marker followed by three Botts' dots."
"More recently, Botts' dots have been used in the snow-free areas of Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Georgia, Washington, and Texas. Some states that do experience snow, particularly Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, use Botts' dots only during the summer months for temporary lane markings in construction zones. Typically, the dots are installed when construction starts in the spring, and they are removed when work stops for the winter."
"In New Mexico, where snow is common in most locations during the winter, Botts' dots are used along with Stimsonite markers to outline gore areas at interchanges, but the state does not use either for regular lane markings on state highways. Some local jurisdictions (notably Alamogordo and Las Cruces) use Botts' dots and Stimsonite markers for regular lane markings on local streets. Botts' dots had also been employed previously in Albuquerque, but the city has since discontinued their use in favor of reflective paint for pavement markings."
"Until the late 1990s, Botts' dots were also used extensively in the snow-free areas of Arizona, however, ADOT has since ended this practice, opting for painted stripes with Stimsonite markers instead. However, they can still be found on US Route 95 south of Yuma, as well as on some local streets in Yuma and Tucson."
"Many states in snow-prone areas of the Midwest and Northeastern United States use Stimsonite reflectors placed into protective metal castings, which allow them to be plowed over without being dislodged from the road surface. These pavement markers are usually augmented with reflective paint and delineators placed on plastic or metal posts at regular intervals along the edges of the road. In California and other locations in the Southwest United States that experience occasional but significant snowfall, the Stimsonite reflectors are placed into recessed pockets in the roadway, which allows visibility during dry weather but permits a plow blade to travel across the reflector without dislodging it, with no special protective castings needed."
