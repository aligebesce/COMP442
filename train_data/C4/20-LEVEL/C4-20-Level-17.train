can you find a key that fits the lock ?
yes ?
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that
Oh easily
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it?
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water
And water
"erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole"
Yes
so if you just put the
well
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere
Yeah
"I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it?"
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee
"Hello, hello, hello"
if he's on there just shout at him will you because
oh he's in here
he's by the radiator aren't you beaut?
"He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you?"
"Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is  it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it."
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes
"one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document"
Yeah
"to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along"
Personally I would of
Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it?
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical
"you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see"
Oh
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that
"oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it?"
Lets.
Stack them high and sell them cheap.
Erm oh we'll they're going to go for twenty P plus cost of the stamped addressed return envelope
Yeah.
friend.
Which is slightly more  than some people   do with their money.
Erm  where are we.
Oh yes orders to receive letter box stickers.
"Erm  Lisa is that  I'm not quite sure, from the York University student rooms, is  in to help us with the big box pile up."
And having spoken to her on Saturday when she came along to the energy conservation stall I intend to invite her if it's alright with the meeting to our next meeting which is on the ninth of February to discuss how the Greens can help how the University Greens can help us with that demonstration.
And perhaps forge a link you never know.
So if that's that's approved I'll give that a tick and so we can bring it up again later.
Great.
Erm I've also received information on conference accommodation and on the billboards but I've billed those as separate items so that you don't listen to me half off all evening.
That's it.
Okay.
Do we have a treasurer's report in absent here?
No he's absent.
He's .
But I do have something from the membership secretary.
Right so that's other officers.
membership secretary.
"Well the membership secretary, if I can remember how to spell it, erm mm has indeed been in touch with erm John  who very kindly sent us a free copy of erm their version of our membership list."
Which is how we found out that one that we have a new member erm Sally  who I'll add on to my list and er send a newsletter to.
Also Joan  Ian  and Mrs Green  erm we all thought they joined locally and the national party have no record.
It's the same old story.
Erm John  has suggested that we send their membership on and then that's definitely it.
We're now all up to date and we agree with head office and we can take it from here.
Erm one minor alteration on that point.
I've got a membership card for  possibly er previous
From January.
sort of yeah from the end of January's er
"Right, that's the other element, it's what you think they think you should be doing and it's amazing how few people, yeah that's the  yeah"
"I  talking about, but that's what job specs are all about."
"It might seem long-winded, but dependent upon er if you get it right at the start with it, it might mean that one of the things we're suggesting er you might say no, it's not for me this, but you might think that job analysis is a good way of identifying training."
What they've gotta do and why they do it.
What's the starting point for job analysis do you think?
What's the first thing you've gotta identify?
"Yeah, the need for the job er  er  yeah, not, not quite exactly what I'm looking for,the way of the trainer's dilemma isn't it?"
"I've got an answer for that it's not quite right, what shall I do?"
"Can I just say no, shut up."
Or should I and this is all part of it isn't it?
Cos he won't say anything to me if I don't know what's wrong
erm won't say anything else will he?
What  results
"Yeah, alright."
"Yeah okay, so we're looking for results."
The results of this person why are they employed.
So the results that we expect out the job.
If you get results it could earn a job analysis what would we do?
"If I, if I was a job analysis person, what will I  sit next to you wouldn't I and what would I have missed out?"
"Right, yeah."
Another word for main responsibilities.
"Mm, you're testing me today aren't you!"
Right.
Key  tasks  What is the person's key task?
This is difficult stuff I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this  because it's covered on various other courses as well.
"Things like appraisal skills er level one level two, various others, other courses that we run."
"There's your job  the first thing I should do is say well what are the key tasks, what are the areas that would mean results?"
Perhaps a working demonstration might highlight something I'm trying to .
Take the job of a receptionist.
Who's been a receptionist?
You have haven't you Elaine?
Yes
"So they went up there and did that, and then, I ca they've done quite a lot and then they're going up London tomorrow, I think."
So I don't see much of her.
So you think they'll probably stay up there next weekend?
Don't know.
"I'll see, I might, might go out tomorrow instead of Sunday."
"I don't know yet, I don't know ."
"What's happening about your car, is Craig going to take it back with him?"
"Well, I suppose he might as well, I mean, if you're off work, he might as well have it, mightn't he?"
"Yeah, that's true."
Mm.
"Unless I feel like being really vindictive,"
"saying, I want the car."
No.
I don't need it.
"I could have done with it, I couldn't get on the bloo they got this internal bus service that runs from each college, cos you have to go to the other colleges for your lectures, and I just sort, there's not enough, and you, you get turned away, and I just thought, I went for that bus Tuesday morning, I was supposed to get it at eight fifteen, and he just said sorry,no more room ."
"Oh no, so what happens then?"
"So, security guard came over, and if you go up to the next stop,bus, you could come in with them."
"So we got on that bus, and he didn't like it, this bus driver,oh, you're not supposed to be on here"
"What, because you hadn't parked your cars there first?"
"Yeah, but the thing is, we're not from  college, so that means their students are gonna be, like, pushed out."
Yeah.
"So anyway, we got on, and he"
"Well, that's their problem, they should get more bloody buses."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, the thing was, because it left about fifteen minutes later, at a quarter past eight, there was so much difference in traffic,"
Mm.
"half eight, getting on quarter to nine, it was jam-packed and I didn't get into the college."
It's a ten minute bus ride.
I didn't get into that college until gone half nine.
"Oh, really?"
To my lecture.
"Yeah, I didn't walk in till half nine."
The lecture starts at nine.
.
"Yes, I I think, in cer in in most cases that would happen, wouldn't it, if if if the child starts off with a feeling of insecurity, with possible instability."
Mm.
Then a powerful father is going to make the situation  worse.
Because him being the only son.
Mm.
"He was probably spoilt by his sisters, and and got more or less what he wanted as a child, and"
As a child.
"Carried on  you know, what I want, I get."
Mm.
in adulthood.
"What is this, thirty, thirty, how old was he, thirty-one when he died."
Thirty-one.
"Oh, yes."
"Thirty-one very very young age, for someone, apparently so so talented to die."
Think there were drugs as well as the drink.
"Oh well, that"
"Yes, yes, yes, yeah."
"Not mentioned there, but doubtless."
"That is, that is true."
"Okay, the next thing, erm, accurate or not, Trevor and I have already sa erm, talked about this, erm, many an Adult School members will remember the enthusiasm and popularity that surrounded the future Edward the eighth, when he was Prince of Wales."
"Prince of Wales it is suggested erm, was a black sheep of the family."
"Here it was thought, was a man who understood the people and  for them."
"Someone with a genuine concern for the wounded of World War One, the miners of South Wales, the unemployed, for, and homeless in general."
"In slightly less than a year, citizens high expectations had been shattered and it was all over."
"As John Parker put it, in the King of Fools, he had it all, wealth, charm, good looks, and he threw it all away on an American divorcee, who even his closest advisers considered an adventuress."
On the folly of his Nazis connections.
"On the absurdity of his get rich quick schemes, which involved him with shady financiers."
Why?
"This much travelled man, with all of his promise was at best, a controversial figure, and at worst a family black sheep."
"He could have said with Hamlet, The Time is Out of Joint, and Cursed Spit that Ever I was Born to Set it Right."
"Edward, known as David to his family, did not want the role of Kingship, but then, neither did his brother Bertie."
We didn't come into it
"Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details."
Well this was erm Bulgaria
"Yes, yes"
Mm
"but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in."
I certainly wouldn't coach it  so  I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you?
"Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to  to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time"
Yeah
"cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean  I'm not particularly bothered whether"
"comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his"
"Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him"
"Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he?"
"But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility"
"Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?"
Italy
Did they?
Yes Florentine
or near Venice
That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there
Yes
"that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to"
What they got
"afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage"
Yes that's a point
"so, you know"
"that's a point, yeah"
so unless erm
even if we
tell us we
went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we?
What does against animal testing mean?
These are the kind of things that are actually on cosmetic products.
Mm.
"It could mean, erm, against animal testing but I go along with it anyway."
"It could mean erm  cruelty free, er erm who de defines in that case, what cruelty is?"
"Er, not, not tested on animals might mean, by me  by but by someone else!"
And it all sells products!
"And, beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er, trying to put forward an E C  erm, directive on th er, the labelling of cosmetics, but it's very, very difficult!"
"And, mainly because of those kind of problems."
Yeah.
Yep.
"What do you mean by  erm, not tested on animals?"
The finished product?
The ingredient?
Ingredients are tested for other reasons too  not necessarily just for the cosmetic and toiletry trade.
"I think that one of the outstanding erm  criticisms that I would make  of the whole programme, in research with animals, is the fact that only two licences have been revoked I think you said"
Mhm.
"on  now, I think it's a bit like factory inspectors, and I talk from experience on this, er  th o i me , everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors"
Mhm.
arrive!
"If you report something you always get the same reply, nothing wrong when we went round!"
Mm.
"I'd like to move with th er, I I think tha wi given wi , though we haven't got all that much time, can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm  the use of animals in recreation and er  Lisa particularly mentioned hunting, now, she thinks hunting should be banned, do you?"
Do you think hunting animals should be banned?
"Various animals that  hunted in this country, foxes, in some places deer, hares are coursed er in some places."
Well well!
There's an interesting result!
"Seventy nine of you think yes, hunting should be banned."
"For the minority, twenty one say, no."
Would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no?
Yes?
"Well I I so , should er  be unhappy to see the, the the red-coated huntsmen  a an abolished scenario."
as the dances are concerned.
And another thing is the young ones don't dance.
They can
Do you mean by young ones my generation ?
"I mean , yes, well maybe you can but I do but the the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like Carl and them, they can disco but they they can't waltz or  er foxtrot or"
How did you learn to waltz then?
"Just by going to dances, just by going to dances, we just, you just picked it up, your your partner could do it and you just learnt from there."
Mhm.
That's one thing I've always been a quick learner which has been quite
Mhm.
I think Jane's got  er that as well.
She seem to be able to pick thing sup.
Does she like dancing?
Not as fa not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up.
Mhm.
"It was the same in the the pantomimes when Lily has learnt learnt the dancing, I could er after she had showed us about twice I could I could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps."
So it's quite an advantage.
So did you go to dances quite a lot before you were married  ?
Oh yes in  aye.
Was that the place where everybody went to
To the Town Hall.
young lads and lasses would get together ?
"Lasses would yes, aye, to the dances."
"And they used to run  er buses to different places, you know, you used to go to different places, and ."
And what kind of band played for the dances when you were in  then?
"Bands like what Tommy has, you know accordion bands."
That er they were all more or less that kind of band.
So by the time you came here it would mostly just be Tommy that was playing?
"Roundabouts, er the only one I can remember is Tommy round about, you know playing er in the Hall."
"And , it was just these kind of bands that"
Mhm.
"were in those days, the accordion bands."
"They're not very flattering  they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid  I think er  you tried to get away from the traditional type of"
Oh I see these one that they send in
Mm
Yes I er
by the thousands
I don't go a lot on them myself
"Oh poetry   some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad."
"Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name"
about the gas and that
Oh to be honest I can't remember the
"Mm, very poignant"
"Mm, but er"
anti war
what was the one about the erm  oh  it was about the assembling of the gun
"Oh yes, oh"
do you remember that?
And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts
That's right yes
and er
Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now
Mm
horrible.
"There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs"
Mm
which are supposed to be erm
Come here
seventeenth century
come here scallywag
"They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually"
Mm
you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on
and the guy that's faked it has done all this
"Thanks, bye bye."
You can stay of course!
Don't blame you!
Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business.
Do you all have sight of that?
"It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para."
"2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you."
Are you agreed?
Agreed.
So that we can get on with this work.
Thank you very much indeed.
On to item six and seven.
You'll remember we do this on an annual basis.
It's very efficiently organised for us to do.
"We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers."
"Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford."
"Thanks, Chair."
"Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair."
"This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,"
She does?
She's one of the members you can come to.
So Katherine can answer the details on the report.
Right.
"Welcome, Katherine."
I didn't realize that's who you are.
I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes!
"So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage?"
"I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford."
Right
That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention.
"So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag."
"Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford."
"What I'm looking for, this is part of"
I know
Sorry.
this is part of the
the spirit.
"The reason this came about Dennis, is because some people were, were playing ducks and drakes."
"And the spirit of the exercise is that we will work as a team, and the most cost-effective procedure will exist."
"And in m in many cases the most cost-effective procedure will be for the lad on site, the R E or the assistant R E to measure, and provide the measure to the Q Ss who will put that forward and process that in the way they do now and send out a certificate."
And I don't see anything contentious about that.
Can I take it that if
"I don't, I don't like how it is worded then, because I don't think you said that."
Sorry to
No.
"It, it was worded that way because there are"
It says  the project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements .
That's what it says.
Yes.
He is responsible for that.
He is.
And he may delegate that
He may delegate to
I agree with you  but
and in many cases will delegate that.
He is also responsible for the valuation
He has raised it with the contractor.
It doesn't say that here.
It does.
But there's no .
The letter of delegation normally says that
"It says, normally it says, normally obtaining them personally"
The letter of delegation has always said that Q S will measure
Yeah.
Mm.
.
Mm.
"Erm, say anything about that?"
"Well it's not sort of place you can get it to, before, before breakfast is it, so er, no."
Mm.
"It's not, we, we have sometimes gone very early on a Saturday morning to places like Nottingham, but, it's not too far for that."
"Right, well that's good, erm, and, so in, in relation to the A G M erm we did, we were asked about putting in motion's erm, are you having to leave the one about the press  after what John said?"
How do you feel?.
"One, what, one that we erm, one, yes, yes, but as a group why don't we review having another prisoner when we got"
"When we got, when we got the next one yes certainly."
"Yeah , and then to see."
"Mm, mm, right and are we, I mean if anybody still wanted to put in a motion, there is still time just about."
"Yeah about , just about, yeah ."
"But eh, you'd have to have it sort of written out and more or less ready I think to go."
"All groups are invited to send resolution which may or may not be actually debated but erm, we, we don't normally send one in, but some, some groups they send them in, no, no one 's thinking"
Think the closing dates a few days time isn't it?
Thursday.
"Thursday, yeah."
"Oh, right, so it's very close."
"Got to be ready tonight, if they're to get it."
No.
"Right, erm, so, I think, I think, as far as future events that's all what we need to mention?"
"Now, erm Rose is secretary and she's had things through from er British Section Headquarters and she'll tell us what she's got there."
"Erm  I don't know if this one concerns us, it's about er, a working group for children, do we have, we don't have a working group for children ."
"No, we've never been very close to the  now."
I won't obviously .
"Erm, I've also received information from the Region, erm with lots of events that's coming up in the East Anglian Region, erm, just run through those quickly, er, there is a workshop on  this Thursday at the Courts , erm, there is on Thursday twelfth of March there is er, somebody from the Columbian committee for human rights speaking at an open meeting, that's the fifth  er, Wednesday first of April there is er somebody called Duncan , he's a paediatric surgeon who works part time as a volunteer at the Medical Foundation for the Care and Victims of Torture who will be speaking at St. Mary's and St. Edmunds group, and that, that's Bury St. Edmunds, and then the next East Anglia Regional Meeting is on Saturday May the twenty third at Bury St. Edmunds again."
May twenty third?
"Yeah May the twenty third, it's a Saturday two to five pm at the Friends' Meeting House, Bury."
Bank Holiday weekend isn't it?
I don't know.
going on.
"that falls down Hugh, is that people assume because they've commented that, that when it comes out in its final version it'll reflect their particular comment."
"They never get a feedback saying, thanks for those comments but I've  those because, because I thought somebody else's"
comments were more
a lot more slice .
No.
No.
"Not not, not"
It's just a modification from
Yeah.
the slices
"L lots of the revisions are not sliced and certainly in, in cases like this where"
Mm.
it is a er er a specific
Direct.
"request or a direct request that something is changed, then it"
is given to in this particular case the Dave  s of the world or other function heads and told
I would still like to issue
that.
"Er a and I think we issue it and then t in Jim's situation, erm I think what you tell your staff is that this, this has been issued, and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization."
Or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look.
"Well surely it, it just means that in in Jim's organization"
"I, I don't see the problem."
that when specifically requested w will apply in
in ninety nine percent of the cases.
That will be reflected in the quality plan anyway.
So
Yeah.
where's
Yes.
the problem?
Mm.
"Shall we have just a quick Lisa and Dean want to tell us what's going, cos they've had you, had the first meeting now, haven't you?"
Do you want to tell us what interest there was.
"I, I was about to ask the same thing, yeah ."
"Are you going to,interest  ."
"Well I called a meeting but I didn't think I advertised it well enough because there was a lot of interest and then I think we held it at the wrong time as well didn't we,"
Mm.
"we held it after prep, so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm  and lot more people express interest because of that, we haven't actually got any letters yet."
"No, that's  so when we leave there should be more interest."
"Mm, mm, good, good."
"And I'm intending to, to hold a few more assemblies as well to sort of get interest going again because it's been a while since we did an assembly on it, so if we do another one, that usually gets it going again doesn't it?"
"What you run assembly's with on, particular topic then."
"Yeah , well we'll take erm Michael  gave us say erm a, an assembly sheet didn't he and we just read from that, and that got a lot of interest from that."
Yeah
"Mm, good"
How many teams were suppose to meet  out of that?
It was about twelve people.
How many is that?
.
There were a lot more people than that.
That was last week.
"I was gonna say, there were a lot more people when we went to school."
"There are a lot more people than that, there, I only put one advert ."
"Well that's, that's, lot more people who are interested ."
Right.
"Even so, that tell us ."
"Ah right, well yeah, I suppose"
Advertise in Stortford
Twelve is a working number.
"Oh well I hope, I hope it goes right tomorrow."
Yes.
"Yes, good, good, just keep in touch with us and know how things are going."
Yeah.
What you you say the shock of it.
What what was it like?
All of those of us who haven't had a heart attack live in fear of it obviously and think
"Yeah well, I mean we all My father died of a heart attack."
Mm.
And erm er that was a long time ago.
I si think it's very possible that he wouldn't have erm died under today's
Today.
conditions.
I had wonderful treatment in Italy.
I was very close to a a hospital with a wonderful cardiac er unit er where they had a professor who was one of the leading Italian in the subject.
"I was there within an hour, so I couldn't be more grateful and appreciative."
"They're wonderful people, the Italians."
"Er anyway that the the but the actual experience, er one knew something was wrong."
"I was not frightened, I didn't think anything was that wrong."
"But I said to Anne, Look I think you better get a doctor."
This was before it happened or when it happened? you didn't have sort of intimations that something was going to happen ?
"Well I I you see, it's all hindsight."
"I think in truth erm er we'd taken a weekend off and er to go to Venice, there was a big er art exhibition on and Anne wanted to see that."
"Erm and I I wasn't feeling on top form and er looking back, I perhaps should have gone to a doctor then."
But you don't you know.
"Erm but th anyway, there it was and er I had this pain Not not acute, that's why I wasn't that worried."
it didn't last that long.
Erm and from that moment I got into hospital and I had no more trouble.
But I mean of course they plugged me up with all sorts of things.
Wi with of course one disastrous consequence.
"Which er I mean, damn the British media like all politicians do."
One of the things they have to do is to get your uric acid I think it's called erm content correct.
And it it so they give you some m medicine for that.
A side effect of which can be that you can develop gout.
And so the what what what that
"Ah, that explains"
"But, erm  I think they could instead have  an electric fox, if there's such a thing?"
"Or, a drag  and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all."
Okay.
Yes?
"They say that hunting's for er  er human pleasure, er, I mean personally I've only been to one hunt, and I don't see what all the  the, the, the, the trouble's about because the huntsman is only a spectator, it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down."
"What's better than , gassing, shooting, poisoning?"
Mm.
What's more humane?
So you think hunting's fair enough?
"From my point of view, yeah."
Yes?
Beside you.
"Yes, I I would have to, I'd have to disagree with er, my colleague here."
"Erm, I, it's not the  shooting is, most certainly, as long as it's with a  a qualified marksman"
Mm.
it's most
Mhm.
"definitely less cruel than hunting  because the animal is chased and er, what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's, really is  the idea's quite horrendous to me!"
"And actually, hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes, a a hunt probably erm, kills one an, at a meet  if they're lucky."
"But hunting does maintain jobs, and countryside people often say."
Would anyone like
Mm.
"to talk to, to to that?"
Yes?
Well coming from a rural community
erm  hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the
Yeah.
"economy of the community  and to have suburbia creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been  the foundation of the  of their economy, for many, many years is  almost ridiculous!"
Mhm.
Down there.
I think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart legitimized by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children!
"When children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society, and they see us as one world  we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world, and that includes the animals in it."
he meant to hit the car that was going
I know
so silly in he?
"he hit the back window and then he didn't do nothing, but then it all shattered"
"did the man go up the school?, he never did he?"
"he did and he thought I grassed, but I never, geezer want your window smashed"
yeah
"a red light come on the back and when, and then when the  and let them go, must of heard it, saw  running  and he's"
"er, he didn't have to pay did he?"
"no, he"
what happened about it then?
and then Andy got enough trouble that year cos he  as well didn't he?
"I know, he put all the paper up his arm"
that was
"how long these tapes for?, like the first seven"
"there, then, they're ninety minutes tape"
"no not first, not all of 'em is it?"
"yeah, they're T D K ninety they are"
"yeah, I don't think the other ones are"
is that ninety minutes each way?
"what?, no it's just, it might be forty five"
"and I'm gonna go like and Leyton Orient just scored the goal for this, that and the other  it's a big area, and everyone's going what commentator for  I said I'm not  I'm on the radio"
"yeah, that'll get nicked off ya"
no it won't
that will
"I will go  what I'll do tomorrow is  zip it in my inside pocket there and wire it  and all you can see, that's enough really  you don't have to ask"
who?
does he bunk off a lot Peter?
"no he don't bunk, he, he has got a lot of things, you know, he orders and that"
see you later
"Ah Ricky  did you see the state of our trainers?er ah Richard it's fucked up, just gonna go over there it's alright Ricky I'll do  Rick I can just tear this off, but I like the noise on the thing"
you never know
"Well I can draw the E I P to a close, sorry?"
Why?
Do we?
"Mr Mr Donson, yes, oh that's right, we posed a question to you on the elephant analogy."
What is the equivalent on affordable housing?
"I thinking about it over erm er coffee sir, I I I think the answer is an adder erm because its smaller than an elephant, it's indigenous to the United Kingdom, it blends into the landscape, but if you ignore it it could be just as injurious to your health."
Excellent.
.
Well with that I think I can draw the E I P to a close .
Can I say it it's er we've had a a good day from my point of view anyway.
"Erm some days have been better than others but I I I have in retrospect enjoyed it,heartbroke though it is."
"Er and from our point of view er erm the panel, erm this is only the end of the beginning for us because we've got a lot of other work to do."
Er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions.
"I'm also particularly grateful for, and I said yesterday, to our two friends in the right hand corner here who've er done some sterling work."
I'm grateful to North Yorkshire and through you to the Strensall people for the arrangements and the use of the Village Hall and I think I must commend Mr Whipp for his fortitude through the last week or so.
Because even if he wasn't participating he was sitting listening.
Thank you very much.
"Chairman before before you do finally er pack your bag and zoom off back to wherever it is you're going, could I on behalf of the county council and all of our participants here today and those who've been around in the last fortnight thank you and Miss Whittaker and your assistant able assistants er Mrs Binns and Dave  in the programme office for the sterling work they've done."
And for making the E I P erm an interesting and er fortnight and I think er commending on the way that you er and your colleagues have handled it er all the way through and er we hope that er at the end of the day we'll get something back from you fairly quickly which er we'll act upon.
I won't promise
Thank you very much Chairman.
I shan't promise before Christmas..
Hiya.
Hello.
Oh oh here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.
Well Miss  come and have your head cut off.
Erm
She's got asthma.
Right.
Mhm.
right okay what sort of.
Do you make presentations now?
meetings
yep so it's it's about meetings?
yep
"great, thanks, Tom"
"erm, my name's   from Edinburgh a couple of jobs  one which is  the sort of presentations I do tends to be one to one  the hardest one for me as I say meetings with quite a lot of people there"
right
"erm, I think I want to try and improve my presentation"
"right, so it's the actual presentation skills themselves"
that's right
and what we actually do when we're standing up so that it becomes more effective yeah?
Great.
my name's  I'm from Tarmac Construction Plant at  depot  I'm office manager and I'm also in charge of the stores hiring all the plant and equipment for all the sites in our area
right
I also  as many stores as possible
of course
erm I don't make presentations as such but erm I do have one to one discussions with on the sites on what plant they need and stores
"right, yep"
basically I hope to be more  effective in talking to  as I can
"right, so it's about persuasion isn't it?"
yeah
"right,Mike"
"I'm  I'm a site agent for Tarmac Construction at  erm I attend quite a few erm presentations really, tender interviews often going to the clients management meetings, site meetings and then like a lot of you the one to one situation."
sure
apart from most of those
right
erm I'd like to be able to present something in front of me which prompts me a bit better than I do at the moment I tend to get lost in what's in front of me.
"right, right so that's that's partly to do with you your preparation isn't it but it's if I put the word script"
yeah
we'll I know what we mean yep  how do you prepare what what you physically have in front of you so that you're able to put the point over effectively
"yeah right yep great, Dave"
comprehensive list.
New recruits ask them  what a good idea.
"Charts of  asking questions, if people come to you and ask questions keep referring the same things  similar things to you all the time."
Perhaps it's cos they don't know the basics.
What sort of errors do they make?
Persistently make errors and the same  with it.
"Complaints from other departments and complaints from members of the public, changes in job spec er new technology perhaps er   backlogs that, people always have a backlog don't they?"
"Is it cos they're lazy, often think it's cos they're lazy don't they?"
I think it's often because people are always  and then it always gets put to the bottom of the pile.
Things they're not so sure about .
"Perhaps might not be it, can't, you can't wave a magic wand and say everything's  but they might not."
Body language can suggest you have  like jumping out a window or hanging themselves or whatever.
"Promotion, succession planning."
"We do enough succession planning in C U  you know it's magic you know, you know number two like it's smashing number two it's still you know, you know young children, number two has a different connotation to what it does here, but definitely if you are a number two here, it means the same to what a child thinks it is, but I"
"er, and appraisals."
All  all packets that we can use to identify  I really do need people to talk to me.
"Alright, so that's a brief out overview if you like of some of the errors that we can do."
Let's go a bit more specific  Job analysis.
We do the first bit who needs to be trained  what do they need to know is the second
"Yeah, so what they need to know and why  forms a heading Job Analysis."
Where do you get your job analysis from?
Personnel.
What?
Personnel.
Personnel.
"Okay, has anyone seen their job spec?"
Does it actually give you any training  on it?
It's very broad isn't it  yeah.
Erm
Oh no it's the same sort of thing you're told it when you
You're told it aren't you?
It tends to be blocked up in somebody's mind what you do.
If he's coming he might like to be
to be
There's a good chance of filling most rooms most nights I would have thought.
Well shall I ring Joyce back and say providing it's close erm we'll have it and take it from there.
Okay.
Oh I haven't written .
Shall I alert Dick to its existence then?
Yes I think that would be that would be a nice thing to do.
Cos that would be a nice definite.
Okay.
I'll make a decision when I'm in a position to .
Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
Do you have to send off a deposit or anything?
I'll find out when I ring and she'll .
If I do I'll be ringing round frantically  find out what to do .
I would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going.
Is that agreed with all of you here.
Sure mm.
Since the local party's going to cover the shortfall anyway if there one.
Okay.
she'll be subletting rooms to people.
Slum land for the Green Party   .
.
Right is that erm.
Okay presumably I should put something again in the newsletter about conference and this accommodation thing.
Yeah.
Yeah it it means that you can point out that it makes it a lot simpler for someone to just pop over for a night and crash out on the floor.
Are you coming to conference at all.
No I won't be er my family situation can change so.
Oh.
Don't have to do things like erm .
We can always run a little creche actually for  nanny from Scarborough got a baby as well.
I'm the Chief Superintendent that covers the the north east of England yes.
OK.
So you're the big boss are you?
One of them.
One of them.
Have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me I hope you have.
Now  sorry Alan I've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you?
No not at all.
It won't hurt there we are that's nice OK.
"Now Alan, first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse?"
Sadly the things seem to be getting worse.
Er we the Society try our very best to get over the message to people just before Christmas.
Please don't give a pet for Christmas.
But unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the Society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces.
"Why is it it seems to me also, and I may be totally wrong here, but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals?"
"I mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs, you see them walking around with a big thick necks, the tattoos, the er the boots and the jeans rolled up."
Well I think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image.
Erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big.
Unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it.
It takes
But an an
time it takes money.
Another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats.
That's right yes.
I mean people have er er budgie or er er er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after.
That's right.
Er just before Christmas you see people think that buying a Christmas present er that's easy.
Once you've er got over the newness of it the the the thing can be put in away in a drawer can be put back in it's box.
But with an animal it's for life.
Er you've got to look after it.
You've got to devote a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires.
"I I heard the other day what I thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for Christmas very emotive, er I think it was for the R S P C A, and I I'm told I don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's it's er the sound of a  er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know, Well this is nice my my er family have taken me to the vet, I didn't think I was ill but never mind."
Mm.
"There are no there were no big property owners, no big coal, I mean the colliery company only owned sixty houses, I think, which were sold to the tenants, er when the lease ran out."
W what about the the health service in Nottingham?
In  ?
Er in ?
Sorry.
Erm health service?
Erm what do you mean?
The Doctors?
Mm.
"Oh well you had er some very well loved Doctors, we had the black doctor, Dr , he was er West Indian, he took over from another one, Dr , who was also West Indian, I gathered, I never knew Dr ."
"But Dr  was a good cricketer, erm he also wrote a very You could also read what Dr  put, and he was also said that he sent people to hospital very quickly."
"Erm then there was the er  and he m Dr , and er Dr  and then it became Dr , who is still there."
"Erm Dr  was the medical officer of health, part time, and Dr  was a character, he always had a white carnation, he rode round in a carriage on occasions, and he er wrote copperplate."
"That's when I had to put these things onto dea er put death certificates into  th their the doctor's certificate into  English , erm they were pretty good,t others weren't so g , er you know, weren't so good."
"I have been accused, too, of saying that, You tell your Doctor, I'd know what you, I knew what you'd die of,because they had their own things, their own pet hobbyhorses."
"Erm myocardio degeneration and chronic bronchitis, and erm probably quite accurate, but er short of breaking your neck I think you, bronchitis was the killer, in ."
Mm.
So yo you had to fill in births and deaths certificates?
"Oh yes, I had to co copy them, and er you know, you got these things, but the registrar he was , you know, he was man."
Mm.
Have you s ?
"Did you see many changes in , over the pre-war era?"
"Yes erm  during the h the Probably one of the reasons I was set on to start with, was the tremendous amount of house building."
"I mean, John , who was a local builder, sold a house a day for five years, which is some building."
"And you can see John, whichever way you go into , you'll see John  types E and G, the semi-detached on  Road, Lane and  Road, and  Road."
You'll see them everywhere.
"And one or two people are very honest, they call the  House,because they borrowed the money from Halifax Building Society .."
What about transport in ?
Transport?
Oh well now it isn't a patch on what it was.
"Erm yo there was so many trains into Nottingham, into Victoria at twelve minutes, it took you thirty minutes into the Midland Station, having called at  and , and all sorts of places on the way."
"That is being taken to good money they say, it was the professional's choice yesterday the faces were all backing it yesterday."
"The five to one will last to the end of the ten minute guarantee at the shops, it will then go four and by the  General Pershing could be as low as seven to two or a hundred to thirty according to Ladbrokes."
Hills have had erm  each way for  Nephew and Our Margaret but the focus of the betting today with this rain coming at Cheltenham is going to be Gordon Richard's General Pershing and he's gonna go off a short price.
Is your money going to be on the favourite?
Er my money's gone on Storm Storm Alert about ten days ago at twelves and
Mm.
that's almost certainly enough to nail it to the floor I would have thought.
Are you worried that you were obviously worried about this rain as well?
Er likes it likes the ground.
It needs the ground.
Mhm.
And I've said that you know I'd rather it was on the soft but whether it will get
Yeah.
the trip or not we'll find out this afternoon.
It's gonna be a cracking good race at  too.
But what about the other race meetings today?
Let's have the early news.
Oakes.
Yes.
Wind's up.
"There's no danger of the river rising so fast  it floods the course as it sometimes does but sadly  as you can see, rain overnight and it's raining now."
And do watch out for those roadworks on the M four just by the M twenty five junction.
Well at Nottingham as well as first race twelve forty five there's a wedding.
The prospective Mr and Mrs Martin are celebrating their wedding in a private hospitality suite and as well as er entertaining their guests they're sponsoring the Andy and Tracy wedding day novelties chase.
And they have a runner in .
So all the very best to them.
"The going however whether their horse will like it or not is good from good to firm and there's a non runner in the one fifteen that's number one urgh Canderbill, there we go."
That's about a third of an inch of rain overnight and again it's gonna be wet for the rest of the day.
When you go into the course follow signs for Colic Park.
celebrating your wedding with  Chase but this is Ayr and it's the only dry spot in the British Isles.
There was no rain overnight so that the ground er is good with just a few soft places.
No hazards on the roads.
"And the same in most of our organizations in this country at the present day, and that's what's wrong."
It's holding them back.
"When you've got a left, a right and a centre, you've got three different parties within a party."
So the Labour Party got united then at that time?
"Oh definitely, very well united, yes."
Then.
"But don't forget that was just after the war and er the Labour were beginning to build up, getting things better, run better country than they were  previous p people."
Did the Labour Party gain a lot of support after the war?
"Oh yes, aye they did oh."
"Oh aye proved it, they got in."
E eventually they got into parliament.
"Erm now did your er Labour Party membership lapse after, after that time?"
Er yes it did lapse.
"Because I had seen my young brother-in-law and I says I'm gonna be like that then, didn't fe er feel any of this er at that time."
"Me,as the district council."
I couldn't see myself doing it so as I said I wasn't going to make a fool of myself by putting my name as being nominated forward er as a candidate etcetera  lose interest  that's the first thing that happened because they knew I was an outspoken bloke.
"I knew  spoke too much  next nominee, next candidate for ."
"And I felt it wasn't up to them, I didn't have enough experience I wanted to gain some more experience but it just fell away, lapse."
"And erm you're, you're not a member of the Labour Party again?"
No I'm not a member of the Labour Party yet.
Oh.
"You see the pre the present system we've got  Scottish Old Age Pensioners is non sectarian, non political."
You understand?
Is this er does that actually debar from belonging to er
"Oh I could have er er well it doesn't debar me but I feel it, it would it wouldn't be right, for me being a Labour Party member sitting on a, a non-segregated and non-political gr er ah association,"
Mhm.
"Now er you, you mentioned your, your pensions association."
"Now you're area treasurer, aren't you, for the"
"Area treasurer, er Edinburgh area"
Can you tell me a bit about the organization and what its aims
"Well the aims  I'll just read this  and this says, this gives you most ."
This   the name of the association shall be the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association.
"You're only, you only"
Well you only put
putting that much in
Oh
"in this, in like a pint"
"Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you?"
"That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon"
Mm
"and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon."
Which chemist did you go to?
Bob's
"Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see"
Aye
get in your basket this minute
"I thought, I thought the other one had got it"
"go on , go on."
"When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box"
"Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah"
"you don't see erm doing this  but, well after that, I mean"
"and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose"
"they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or"
Mm
bottles of
"already, ready mix"
"There's a jar already done, you just pour it in"
"Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they?"
You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it?
Ninety percent probably
The erm you get
The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and
Yeah
"which are all, er what they called?"
"What a shame, never mind."
"Right, I'll put my make up on"
Can you tell me where you want this umbrella tree?
Er
it needs a saucer of course
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one
Oh but that's in
Well
plant pot  altogether
"Well, just leave it there for now."
"Erm, I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops"
It's ten o'clock
I know.
I'll have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner .
Oh my head feels .
I do I haven't had a headache like this for
I wanted a carton of live yoghurt.
"I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start it was fruit flavoured, no it wasn't it was natural, but it said mild flavoured and I don't think it was the proper like the Greek style really live yoghurt that would have started all the fungus growing on it."
It is beginning to look like a proper .
"Er, ok, I'll go and get ready"
I don't think it matters but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I've got it standing on that brick to drain.
Wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the erm stems on it look as if as if , not mouldy, but er they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put another one in
green
"Those hyacinths in the corner are taking a long time to come out, aren't they?"
"I'd have though the tulip  in the coal scuttle, the tulips in the cauldron, I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely"
"I know, but they've straightened out"
but they've grown up again.
And those forget me nots that're called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers are coming out with tiny pinky purple flowers.
"Thirty odd, thirty"
"That's round about thirty-seven per cent, innit, somewhere around there."
"Yeah, we paid thirty eight pound off it last year."
Makes more.
"It's ridiculous, you know, mortgage payments."
When you think of it.
I know.
"and on 'ouse, they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound, you could say, nine hundred pound interest on 'ouse."
Oi.
"I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are, because, you know,it it's totally unfair,"
They are.
"I mean, alright, we know you're handling large lumps of money, but when you think of it, if you, if you, borrowed it at a different rate, you know, same rate as you could do finance, 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it."
Yeah.
You know what I mean.
"Instead of having all these different mortgage companies, Abbey National and that, the government have er, have er, a whatsname to do it, they're wouldn't be half and a quarter."
"I mean, it happens all over the world, you know, in in the in the especially in the whatsname countries."
I know.
Communist countries.
"Everything's owned by the by the government and er, I know it's not a right good thing, like, but if it could work properly, it would be a damn good thing."
Watch she don't bite ya.
"I mean, communism in England,"
"in it's  in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing, but er, it's on because er, it's only the rich people what make people poor."
I know.
"The say as with damn education, like, at bloody Tory sods, they took all blinking, we gi for al for all these people what's going to college, every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em."
No.
"So I my opinion, what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class, well I say lower classes, the lo the the"
isn't it.
"poorer people, they stop 'em getting educated."
That I'm I'm almost convinced.
Yeah.
"It says, everything they're doing, it says, is going back to the eighteenth century, when you hear about these Kath Catherine Cookson days, working for pennies and you can't get educated"
"un cutting back,"
"Sir, is Miss  not in?"
No.
Could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room.
Well who's taking Miss  's class?
question?
What?
the answer.
Can you come through please.
Right folks  Donald is here making typical  of English in use  from schools at the moment.
So if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful.
I intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that  Kevin has done.
He's  his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done.
"He has  varnished the back with, can you remember what sort of special old varnish it was?"
Straw hat.
Correct.
Well done.
Straw hat varnish.
Now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax coating using the etching .
Drawn this little character and what I intend to do is put this into acid  and etch it.
The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule.
When that's happened I'll take it out of the acid  clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate.
"I would like you all to try to  remember  the stages of the process because you're going to have to do, as I said to you last lesson, a small write up on this in order to get your unit of accreditation  for this work."
That is to say your special certificates .
Right erm  would you normally be  room?
Would you normally be in this room?
Is it likely that there are other pupils who may turn up in that room in a few minutes?
Or do you think that you may be the only ones?
Are they all on the English trip?
Okay.
In that case could you just take your coats off and put them somewhere  erm out of the way.
Please.
"she was nearly retired, Billy"
"she was nearly retiring by the, no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for, two or three years after we came up here, but I would be in the choir just, maybe two or three years."
And then it
And did it
"it fell the choir fell folded up ,"
Folded up and she
"Aye, oh"
retired?
There was nobody else took it on.
Was there a church choir going at that time then?
"Yes, aye there would be, just the same ladies that have s been in it for years."
"But there were men in it for quite a while, I was wondering when that kind of faded out."
Oh that was faded out before
That was a good while before
Aye before we came up here.
"I wonder if, it Mr, was it  choir or his father or something that had it, I can if I can remember somebody saying."
So what was going on in the way of entertainments and things like that when you came to  ?
When I came up to live here?
"There was quite a few dances, in er, do you mean dances in the Town Hall?"
"Ah there would be  there well just one or two, not not every week or anything like that as far as I can remember."
Just a few over the winter?
"Just aye, aye, oh they didn't have them in the in the summer, and of course in them days well the  the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and"
It's hardly worth having a dance .
It's not worth having a dance.
"But I heard the Town Hall was having one, not the Town, was it the Town Hall or Community Council having one between, I think it's the Town Hall, between Christmas and New Year and really I don't think it's worth their while  having them then."
Do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a=less dances and things then?
Do you mean the bars being op oh I think
And clubs.
I think so really
Do you think it's the main thing ?
"I think that's what's really, it's killed them  as far"
Mhm.
He should know about them shouldn't he?
"Well we must  that's why, certainly have to, before"
Could you drag him along  to a meeting?
Yeah well that's what  they said we could do that.
I'll write that down.
"Erm, is that okay for that I just have something that I read in New Scientist does everybody take it?"
No
Oh well I'll give you one to look at  it's just a little article about
Thank you.
recycling in in Egypt.
And I just liked reading it so much that I thought you'd like to read it too.
Don't have to read it now cos it's quite long.
It's it's  it's really hot  .
Cos they they reuse absolutely everything.
And they make they're living out of it.
In East German they are now drowning in rubbish because  they used to have a perfect recycling scheme  everything was collected and recycled cos they just didn't have the materials.
Now they are flooded with the West European goods  their recycling isn't worth any more.
On the other hand they haven't got the landfills and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they   I mean it's a health  hazard meanwhile.
One of the major problems they have to face.
Far East  lots of guys sort of collecting cardboard boxes and that's all they did they flatten down cardboard boxes and then another one did newspapers and whole newspapers and
The whole town is composed of a
Yeah.
it's like a big .
I just thought it was  interesting.
Erm  I did write er as was suggested asking about  erm facilities for cyclists in the potential  shopping centre development in Bishop's Stortford.
"And they are, they are interested in cyclists but from what I could make out reading this  they're not really going to help us a great deal."
If you want to pass it round and read it.
It's it's they're gonna use the green wedges that are already there and the existing footpaths which are already cycled along.
"What, what good is that to me?"
It's just  in Stortford it's not that easy for a cyclist is it?
No
And they've got all the places  say don't lean your bicycle here and you're not allowed to take it into Jackson
oooh
"And everyone's very welcome to come, I'll let you know"
reply to it
Eleventh of March
Well it's now come under a general invited round to us all
Yeah
"Eleventh of March, yeah"
"The  on the contacts slip so you can read at your leisure, anybody else want to raise any points, Tracy at all, David"
About car park
"Green vans, green vans"
green vans
Are we
I'm gonna tell it
don't start
"No, I've been and spoken to them again this morning and yesterday, R S C left it there not O S D although it's O S D's van, so they should've come out to move it on Friday and the mechanics didn't turn up, then they lost the keys, cos yesterday myself and who was it, Lyn, waited up for the keys cos they were gonna move down put it into a safer spot."
mm
Couldn't find the keys anywhere
Well they were hung up on the board in O S D on Friday when I went down there
Which which office?
In the a in the
"No, you know you know as you're going down the corridor before you get to the doors to go down the next set of stairs, I mean in O S D, the last one is er for the P C that does all the man er you know all the duties and things like that, and in his office there's a great big board with all the vehicles on, and the key's hung up at the end and who's got 'em out, and the bottom one is that green van, because he went up and picked 'em up, when I was there."
I was coming to David
tomorrow morning if it's still there
yeah
yeah
We're not gonna put any  down cos it's going somewhere else
But they're gonna have to find him
Erm Bob  Bob
No no no
You have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across across the transit van bays
So nobody can get in at all
"Mm, or their transits"
And that's how we got them.
"And I di in the end they   the same for them, but"
He and Geoff went over there and loaded them on the trailer .
we would of done it by ourself  sorted out.
"Yeah we do a  we went over there and loaded them all on and then got a puncture in the trailer,!"
"Put them on a  didn't they, then load them  load"
Yeah.
them on  yeah.
Used be able to sit in the car   would be   go up the back don't they?
Yeah.
"And I used to load the boot up  and bring them  and load home like in the boot of my car  my Sales Manager said to me the other day, how the hell did you get bright red dust in your boot?"
I dunno!
There's all like red brick dust in your boot!
Oh no!
Geoff was getting the bricks.
"And I had Avenger estate, and I done the same with that  and I got away with it for ages and I   what you want a do, I know what you wanna do  he erm, I mean that's that's really sort of pushing it over the top  but he got a great big sheet of polythene, he went down to ready mix  and had a load of ready mix in the back of this  Avenger estate, brand new he'd only just got it!"
And course
Well we didn't do that but
and then on top of that he took the battery off  Pat's car  and it fell over in the front so all the acid burnt the carpet!
"Come back dinner time  and they were saying well no you see you can't just a borrow a car to go to dinner in, yeah that'll be alright man  and I hadn't even been in it  since Roy bought it back!"
Absolutely went spare you know !
"Sent memos all round, you know  and he called me in the office that day, to say I'm really disappointed in you, I said, what do you mean?"
"He said well I give you that Avenger estate he said cos I thought you were building your house, that'll be handy for you you know  yeah you did  and you let me down badly!"
"So I thought now what do I say, do I drop myself in it or do I say well that wasn't , that was Roy, I said well you know I said I must admit I said I  I'm sorry  so erm  then Roy said well that battery he said was me he said I, I borrowed Geoff's car again and look the battery fell over in it so I'm gonna help him  er  then I sa , a piece of that bloody great  went across our French doors and  this, there's a  went across"
Cor!
"there  and I went down to the   at    and he said    we got your lintel in mate, do you want to take it?"
"So I said yeah I can do  so he said bring your van down, so I never said nothing  so Bob said, got any  like your dad had"
Oh yeah.
"It's for our new one again you see  so I rolled the front seat down  put my brief case on the front seat  so he says, where's your van then mate?"
I said it's here!
"No, where is it?"
I said that is it!
Yes that's right er I er believe in fact I know because the Duke says so in the Racing Post today the reason he's gone there is to get Adrian Maguire because Adrian has ridden him already in Ireland and the owner wanting to stick with Maguire which you can't blame him for
Exactly
As David Nicholson said he'll be taking orders from the jockey today instead of the other way around.
I don't imagine he says that very often.
Perhaps he's given the Duke his orders.
Oh I'd like to do that.
Now well let's have a look at this horse and another schedule because as I say he was trained in Ireland by Arthur  and er we saw them at Punchestown back in April where he finished second to another of his rivals today  Bishops Hall.
"As they come to the final fence Second Schedule being pressed by Ebony Jane and Bishops Hall on the nearside and over the last Second Schedule and Bishops Hall on the nearside, Ebony Jane in third, in fourth place is Joe White and racing into the closing stages it's Second Schedule with Bishops Hall on the nearside Graham Bradley again as they go to the line, Bishops Hall wins it for Harry , Second Schedule is second, Joe White is third, Ebony Jane four."
Bishops Hall doing it nicely under Brad and it's good to see him in the saddle today because he was offered the ride on Morley Street but he'd already said yes and he's a man of his word and he agreed to ride this horse.
And there's been a lot of hoo-ha in the Press about should be ride Morley Street or shouldn't he.
"Once you say yes you gotta stick to your word and Morley Street, good horse, but has a lot of weight today."
Lot of weight and again it's it's fences isn't it.
He'd last time tried over these he he wasn't at his best.
Erm  had a run on the flat so you know I mean I think we should be  but
"It's a it's a very bold thing of Toby Baldwin to run him in this race it seems to me, you know I mean he definitely appeared to not like  ."
Yes
It's only his third run and he's he's in the most competitive two and a half mile chase in the year.
But he oozes class and he's had a strange preparation.
You mention the flat race.
Let's let's have a look at that race.
It was at Newmarket just a couple of weeks ago.
And I can tell you he he does an an awful lot.
Here you can see him second last but making ground now.
Er My Patriarch and er is is taking the lead from Ritto who later ran so well in the Cesarovitch but just look at Morley Street now.
Here he comes past one past another past yet another into third place in the end  and that was an extraordinarily good performance.
No.
It's a very good turn of
foot for a for a jumper isn't it though ?
Very nice.
And he he very nearly won the Doncaster Cup wasn't it.
Yes I think it was the Doncaster Cup.
Yes mm.
On the deep
Oh on the deep
two or three gorges
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic
"That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and"
"Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep"
"I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new."
"I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean?"
"Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you?"
But
"Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er"
I
the sides are coming out er like this you see
"those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those"
"I, I like them"
"but, but I haven't got enough you see"
Yeah
but er
you won't get two that size will you?
"You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two"
it is a good er about one and five eighths
"Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there"
"Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of"
"Yeah, yeah"
here you see and it'll all be joined up.
"It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down"
"Mm, they're not really safe"
"Yeah,"
a band saw are you now are you?
"I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it"
Yeah
or something like that.
"No, it even says in here, it says look, there well may be groups of supporters in different categories who'd like to arrange seats together, unfortunately not be able to do this unless you are prepared to wait until the end of the main selling period"
Alright
They won't be able to do that to be honest cos they're not gonna go are they?
I don't know
"Eighty thousand, eighty thousand"
Oh about time to
"Boo, who's he?"
"Come on, come on"
You want a chew?
Take one of these they'll make you feel better  oh no don't this is
just say no
Yeah
Or give us here a bloody mint
Ah?
Just got him to give me a mint  gasping for it
I was saying to this bloke at work West Ham must be the only positive transfer to give West Ham pay for about the last twenty five years
"laughing up their sleeves, can't even bloody sell anything, but sell them at a profit."
Who will they sell?
"Gary, Gary"
Oh
and then get Mike
"come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on I say"
well it was just a surprise really
Alright?
"but they're all money, money, money aren't they?"
Yeah I know but
Do what?
boo
"Hooray, come on"
come on   come on you reds
"If they got, if they're not gonna win tonight, if they don't beat Bolton I'm gonna tear my season ticket up look  ah"
You're not even a season holder are you?
So you're looking for attention probably more than anything.
So attention seeking's one thing.
Have a good time.
Sorry?
To have a good time.
"Okay, you could  what, what would you be hoping to achieve during that good time?"
"Have a few laughs, what else though?"
What other things do you hope or do you think might happen shall we say?
To meet some nice people to go on holiday with.
"Right, meeting people."
Things like romance are very important with holidays.
"I mean, you all know about the image the cruiseliners have with wealthy widows and things like that."
"The Club Eighteen Thirty idea is much along similar lines, and if you look at a Club Eighteen Thirty brochure, the sort of activities people do together, bringing people together."
So this is all an important element.
Cuisine.
"Right, cuisine could be an important motivating factor."
Er basically stuffing yourself to excess for two weeks.
Drinking yourself to excess for two weeks for peanuts.
"Again, that would be something."
"But in general the people who are doing some of those things, a lot of it's probably escapism  certain type, complete break from their work."
What other things do you think you would hope to get as a result of your holiday?
Time to relax.
Right.
"Okay time to perhaps to relax, to reflect."
see various water sports
"Okay, so you can improve your prowess at windsurfing."
"And certainly there's the fitness, activity side, that can be an important motivating thing."
What else will you do on holiday?
All we've talked about so far is drinking and lying on a beach.
Sorry?
Sightseeing.
"Right, sightseeing."
"all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens."
"Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are closed ."
.
"Apart from religion or anything else, you know."
"Yeah,."
Yeah.
"It, I think it's nicer when, when it"
"Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful."
"That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing around"
"Just be like a Saturday ,."
"we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really"
No.
it won't be a weekend.
No
"And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they?"
"Well the big ones are, yeah."
Yes.
Oh yes.
"There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as  ."
"But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel."
Yes.
Mm.
"Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re he reckons on Sunday"
Yeah Sunday morning .
.
"But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back."
"We do, we don't buy ."
"Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back."
"Mm, mm."
"And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box."
"And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it"
"Oh yes indeed, indeed , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one."
Right.
Because I've already written to Atkins cos that's in the newsletter.
Yeah.
So he's Secretary of State.
I'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we're here by definition.
And so we're likely to I think if I put the whole list in the newsletter it might have put people off.
Yeah.
Erm
Yes is it  all about this any more in the newsletter next newsletter?
No because I think by the end well unless something dramatic happens on the fourth of February which is this Friday next Friday rather.
If it does I'll be on to you straight on the phone.
But otherwise I I don't expect to need any more work on this for this Friday.
Yeah.
But we ought to have something about having a second reading in it anyway
Oh of course yes.
because it's news.
Yes indeed.
Even if it's stop press.
probably getting tight for Monday the seventh anyway.
Brilliant.
On a point of information Helen what can happen on on this second reading if
Right I can I I can tell you.
Erm there'll be a whole a whole day's debate on the bill which is an achievement in itself.
At the end of which a number of things can happen.
Firstly the bill can go through on the nod with no note.
This is possible with ballot laws  is now ballot bill.
But we can't rely on it.
It's quite possible that some MPs will try and talk the bill out.
That is try and ensure that when the House rises at two thirty P M the debate on the bill is still in progress.
And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate.
"Now this means that the sponsor of the bill, Allan ,brothers,pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading."
In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred MPs in the House to vote for the closure.
"as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet  have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?"
No there's some there
Cooked?
"oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm"
what do you
erm
Are you gonna left that battery on
"well, well only temporarily, I only want this"
"it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to"
"right erm, just erm"
"It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging"
"oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?"
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom
Just down the bottom
Right  what you're going to have to do is erm
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it
"Yeah, yeah"
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
"I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it?"
"Er, well, put it on the floor"
Go in your basket go on
"Yes, I cannot give it much more"
"re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom"
"So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?"
Those four
Mm
to that section of the
"oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say"
it wouldn't split in half went for it and
Twelve inches across are they?
That way
"the main point that I made to him was that after such a superb beginning where, where they actually state how much rubbish we produce, there's absolutely no mention  even though there's space at the bottom  there's no mention of recycling at all."
"And he said well it's a different, you know different department."
Mm.
I know yes
"And this was, this, that, that wouldn't have entered into  that brief but my argument was that, you know everybody would be much happier if there was less rubbish to put in the landfill sites  in the first place."
"Now that was about two weeks ago and I've been sitting on it meaning to, to write to the press and say how disgusting it was."
Which I have just done today.
"Aft , no"
"Yes, half way through I spoke to to the environ environment officer"
Mm
who was much more  switched on.
"He's a new environment officer, he's only been there for a month or something."
And he says that  erm.
He sort of agreed with me that it was a waste of an opportunity.
Erm but he did say that he's actually writing a leaflet which they can run to seven or eight pages.
A detailed one about recycling.
anybody will read so  eight pages.
Well I don't know.
I just don't know.
But I mean he was very interested and when I said that we'd actually done a recycling directory and that I was thinking
redoing it.
Erm.
He was very interested and he would like to meet us and I said that if he's actually doing a directory
all this all this about.
I thought Rob is doing a sort of recycling what do you call it composium
Rob has just done a green audit for the district council.
Yes.
Yes.
But we haven't had the opportunity to read it.
I mean he knows that we have a recycling d .
I was in touch with them.
I sent them the recycling.
The
I
only re yes by all means
our project quality plan check list reflects that.
.
Naturally your
Mm.
your way out is to get
"D Dave  to write a letter, saying for all projects I wish him to do"
Y no.
No.
No.
"Terry, Terry there's no point."
"All all that, all that"
That is stupid.
All that Jim's trying to do
the reason why
Is to change
"I, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way."
No.
No.
I know but
"It, it, it, it is stupid in, in so far as the more sens if we were gonna do that, all you'd do is you'd write"
the procedures in a different way.
Yeah.
The procedures
"were written in this way, because erm there was a move from a certain part of the organization to exclude the Q Ss from elements of work on an unreasonable to an unreasonable extent."
"Now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably, it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who's gonna do the site measure."
But at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct.
"These guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct, from an internal control point of view I want them to be involved in certifying that the price is correct."
That is how we came to the conclusion that they should be
"I, I, I  I certainly think there's a great deal of sense in it all."
You can ring about anything you want actually.
Anything you feel like you can ring I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really you know.
Shame of the Killer oh no I don't think we'll do that er  look through the Sun see if there's anything interesting erm  in there  I've got nothing in the Ewbank .
Boxer Chris Ewbank worth around eight million is moaning that he's got no money.
What has he done with his money?
What has got he didn't give me any.
Oh he's bought a big house has he?
OK.
"Usual sort of sex, drugs, rock and roll as you get in the papers on a Saturday as well."
Or is he the best dress man too?
Chris Ewbank is the best dressed man.
That'll upset Jonathan Ross he always thought he was.
Er O nine O four six four one six four one.
Anybody who can hum by the way the er theme to the television programme Ivanhoe and I would be interested to hear from you as well.
Now as the United Nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens  .
Action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious.
A small group demonstrators have staged a protest outside the U N Headquarters in New York calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of U F Os.
"One of the organizers, Michael Luckman, says President Clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist."
The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life.
Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House.
Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials  around  around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat.
So if erm if if you  yeah yes E T E T phoned when what do you want?
I'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter.
"I mean I just noticed it I read, sorry Karen walked into the studio totally uninvited through a red light."
That's a  particular no no I mean you know for goodness sake can't we av can't we actually ob observe studio discipline?
What you doing?
Just shutting that up a bit.
That's my knob if I want it open I'll leave it open.
Don't flatter yourself.
There we are you see.
Just smutty mind haven't you really.
Er the individual responsible for this this is your letter from the er director of er  the Officers of the Director General's broadcasting Principle Assistant Dalek to the Director General.
Before we get bogged down.
"I haven't received the samples, er oh sorry I I'll moving on to what we're talking about."
The National Party are mounting a poster campaign for the elections.
For both elections which hope hopefully covers the Euros and the er locals starting at the beginning er towards the end of the local election campaign to running through to the  June.
And they said erm if you would like to see the designs write and ask for a sample so we wrote and I haven't actually received any samples yet.
But I have had a letter erm explaining where the billboards are in our area and how much they cost.
It's a very badly written letter actually.
"For one thing it starts,Dear Mrs Knightingale  which got my back up."
"Erm and then it goes on to say,Please find the enclosed the postal sites available in your area Miriam   who's the Green Party person who's organizing it  has provided the required areas and if you need any more details please don't hesitate to call me or my secretary."
And under the sites  may also  availability at the time of booking.
I look forward to hearing from you with your selections .
But introductory letter aside erm  interesting.
Can I just get clarification here?
Yes.
That letter almost sounds like we us around this table are expected to choose some of the sites.
Yeah.
We didn't just write for information as to what National Parties
"Erm well I just wrote Miriam and said, I saw your article in Green Week can you send me further details."
And this is what's happened so.
What it transpires is local parties who are interested enough get what's
Yeah.
get to try and choose site.
Right.
Erm now then it gives us a erm a price here which I think is weekly.
Because the availability columns are weekly so it makes sense that the price means weekly.
Erm and it has a number of different types W and F .
But if I run through the addresses I think it'll make sense because everybody will recognize where they are.
Erm in York Holgate Road which is twelve pounds a week.
Hundred and ten Fishergate which I think is the side of Jacksons that's fifteen pounds a week.
Erm in fact there's two there.
East Parade eighteen pounds a week.
Tang Hall Lane eighteen pounds.
"Erm and er this is coming in old Ordnance Survey map, coming in past the race course, at ."
"And er single track at the time, and running double track, and platforms either side, Erm a er wedge shape platform, nice wooden building there, another building there."
And and er er the platforms either side.
Signal box over here.
"Various sidings, er and the trains from  would come in to the left hand side of the top platform, erm and er would er go over here and and cut back and go out from this er this side."
"A little bit er  It's it's not a very good map the er Ordnance Survey map in the Nottingham Library, er local studies department."
About the best I could get off them.
Erm and I've I've obviously photographed it.
"Now there's a picture er in early B R days again, of the line coming in from  here and the very attractive in my opinion, wooden er structures, the shelter there."
"The racecourse at the back, fencing, platform here, wooden structure here, buildings erm and er you can just see the edge of er another canopy similar to that er on this side."
"This is taken from the er from a sta er from a signal box er just er over sort of where I am, er here roughly in in line."
And er well kept flower beds and so on.
"Barrow crossings here, signals and so on."
"There's another picture, now that's looking erm towards  up there, and the  branch coming in there, behind that er building."
"Very attractive, take note of what that looks like."
"A train waiting to go out go out to , er having met the er Nottingham Lincoln, or Lincoln Nottingham line which you can see just goes up the the back there."
And there's that wooden building there.
"The train having come in from , and just going er forward well I don't know erm before back to er er to ."
"I think that's an ex  carriage actually, but it makes you realize how small these things were."
"In B R days, not a very good picture, but an  B one Thompson, four six O B one on a erm probably a Birmingham  train, er real cross country."
And there's the   er in the platform there just having come in.
"Another picture er of the   not very good, but erm best I can do, best I've got."
"Again see the old wooden structures, rather nice lamps and so on."
That's what you've got now.
Don't know whether that's an improvement upon the wooden structures.
No I think not.
"That's where that rather nice, this is w this is the er the departure platform at ."
"And that's the platform arrival from Nottingham to Lincoln, on the  other side, the Lincoln to Nottingham one."
But er not terribly pretty.
There you can see that's looking up towards .
"Well the junction's gone completely, that was taken two or three years ago."
"And that's what you've got left, up there."
Mhm.
By plant well will be by plant .
Right.
"Erm M for mother four stop one, payment application by contractors."
"Erm there are quite a few in, in this series which follow the same sort of thing is that er, all projects all jobs on site er will have a quantity surveyor from Dave  's section."
Erm and will
Eh?
Nominated.
to do all the post-contract measure work.
Nominated.
Come on.
"Let's, what you're doing is you're winding them up Den."
I'm not.
I can't believe Dennis would be mischievous enough to wind anybody up on p on a subject that he's so disinterested in.
"That's, that isn't"
Yes.
Go on.
I've been told to change these procedures to.
just taken the knife out of your back.
Right.
"The project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements, normally attaining these personally."
"However when specifically requested by the project Q S, the resident engineer or the project engineer may obtain this information."
"A project Q S is responsible for agreeing all valuations and for processing all invoices for payment for physical work, and passing these to the client for payment."
So what's the change?
"Because on many jobs certainly smaller jobs, er the resident engineer or the project engineer would"
be doing the
"And normally normally they will do that and in, in the future"
Well
Yes it will.
"they can say, yeah,th the project Q S is just gonna say, measure me all"
That's right.
I haven't time to go and do that.
Well if there i if there in a
"no matter who, no matter what !"
If they're in a corrupt society  and when they get to that position they  they don't do anything about it and accept
Well they
it and take
they don't
"the bribes, well yes I agree this is the"
Yeah.
the
Yeah.
basis of the mafia isn't it?
"Ah, you see if  if you don't, I mean  it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life  but in big business and in politics  if you don't"
You have to modify your
"I'll tell you , I'll tell you how"
"No, no if you don't tow the line"
Exactly!
If you just don't
if you'd be elected
Yes  and you don't modify you  what happens?
You don't get anywhere!
You don't get elected which is what happened
Well
to the Labour government
No
last time!
"oh well, oh well apart apart from being"
No.
elected
fifty percent of the population
apart from that
"wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the  Labour government didn't get in  on that basis  so they had to modify their  and I mean as"
Well you can use that for any argument then
Well that's got the ball rolling.
Erm  and if anybody runs into anybody else and can ask them or anything if there isn't actually an army of er sort of letters coming through your door saying yes yes make me a candidate.
Just to remind everybody that we've decided that this year we weren't going to put pressure on people.
Because it just took so much of our energy last time helping people fill in forms and everything.
If people aren't comfortable enough to volunteer.
"I mean obviously if  for example didn't ring up and say I want to sign your name your name tomorrow, I'd ring her up to see whether she'd lost her  mind or something ."
Because you know she usually does.
She's actually got er terrible flu.
But I'm going round to see her next weekend.
Yeah but you know what I mean.
If it's somebody who we really expect to stand then by all means then chase them up.
But I don't want to go around looking for candidates like we did last time.
Because it's erm it just takes too much energy away.
Right.
And if we haven't got a full slate well I mean looking at that list we're doing quite well.
Yeah.
So would you be likely to speak to John  saying again wouldn't like to pressure Jean again but think John would like to
I'm sure John would.
Erm I shall ring him and ask him make sure he's
I'll try and ask  .
So have we taken a decision to target Bishopgate then?
Yeah.
It's five for the next five years.
It's quite a commitment.
So we're looking for the ideal candidate.
Yep.
This is before anybody gets any ideas at all.
And the the reasons for it is because we're it's the sort of by far the most solid concentration of our our actual members and likely supporters.
I used to live down there towards one part of that.
Yeah.
So it's all it's from that time on it's .
I'd like to get that back again if we could.
If ones came as  in little wee pi pickups we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something.
This was during the mid thirties?
Oh yes I would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah.
Coming more that
How about the individual er tramps?
Did you ever have bye-names for these characters?
Well th th there was one Joe Wrench.
Er but I don't know what's that.
But somebody so told me aye and I said that was a funny name or was it else's then.
Well I said I remember a man called Joe Wrench and but er oh I wouldn't er but one  said oh Joe Wrench is very black looking.
Well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says I turned the hose on him.
Well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road.
So there was a bit of
Mm.
among the few people that saw that happening.
But er he was quite a character the man that did that.
Did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them?
No well I could never say I I was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen
Mm.
in his bag.
Well I think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another
Mm.
jacket in the bag.
So whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that.
They wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er.
No oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see.
And when they were coming along Lochassynt were they making for anywhere in particular?
We we well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by Nedd and  and probably Scourie they were just doing their circular.
Aye they had their places for.
Yes it's amazing aye.
And did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds?
Who they were in fact?
The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.
Other forms were near.
His sole had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.
"He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.’"
"The beauty of these words cannot entirely hide a sense of suggested differentness, of an essential something so far held back but pushing now to get out."
"It is this sense which seems to be given the clearest possible confirmation in those moments of the portrait of the artist, where the brooding Stephen, Stephen Daedalus , suddenly emerges from his vigilance in a lightening display of strength."
"Here, from the portrait, are two of them."
"‘It's a curious thing, do you know’ Cranley said dispassionately, ‘how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelief."
Did you believe it when you were at school?
I bet you did.’
"‘I did’, Stephen answered."
‘And were you happier then?’
Cranley asked softly.
"‘Happier than you are now, for instance?’"
‘Often happy’ Stephen said ‘and often unhappy.’
‘I was someone else then.’
It's a lot of money.
most of it was fresh produce.
Really?
"They, it's not gonna last, like, they're still b buying more and more of it."
"It wasn't like all your basic items, or anything."
"Mike doesn't eat meat, so like, it's only like, slice of chicken, slice ham and stuff for Maryanne."
Most of it is fresh fruit and veg.
Really?
"There was some booze on there as well, but not much, so erm,"
"Right, a lot of money though, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Fifty pounds for two people.
Mind you if he sees .
"Did you, what did you want on this, did you want some jam, is that alright?"
Strawberry jam?
Have you got any butter
Yes but I remember right a .
So it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of.
When we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans.
Mm.
And my word there was plenty of vans in them days.
Both getting butcher meat.
What even in the thirties?
Yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the Nedd to Lochassynt when when  Lochassynt Lodge you see.
So these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to as well as them.
It's not like nowadays when people has big fridges
Mm.
buy their stuff away down south and take it.
But no they would buy it there aye .
So provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days.
There wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ?
No no there wasn't the same.
But only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er Hamiltons of Glasgow
Mm.
and it would be coming on the steamer McBrayne's steamer and
Up to Lochinver?
Yes to Lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in Kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for Hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er Ceylon coming from Ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter.
But oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk.
Mm.
But that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no peri
Mm.
Can you recall in those days Tommy how people kept perishables?
Well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground.
If there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones
Mm.
and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool.
Mm.
Even in the Summer?
Yes it is.
Yeah.
To that charge Shaun David  do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Worships if I may interrupt the the this erm dispute about the  damage  which was  allegedly caused  I have mentioned it to Miss  this morning and she has  undertaken to make further enquiries.
"Erm  briefly, the situation is that it's alleged that he broke two stained glass door panels  and Mr  denies that he broke  the second of the two, the one at the front door he says was broken  at some time earlier  on the evening on which he was involved."
"Unfortunately Miss  hasn't been able to conclude her enquiries  er, to  apportion the damage  and to take instructions as to the  the residue of what I've just said."
"It is suggested er, by both myself and er  my colleague that the matter should be adjourned for one week."
"Well it, it was adjourned last week for him to  with instructions your worship."
Yes we we've adjourned this case for one week  other enquiries can be made.
"So he doesn't have to, on conditional bail today?"
Well bail will be extended for one week.
"Well you know what that means Mr , you were told  this last week you will be  to surrender yourself to bail  next Tuesday at er ."
Hopefully the matter will proceed next week.
Can we go your worships?
"Yes, you can leave the court."
Case number one your worships please  Peter John .
Are you Peter John ?
That's right.
What's your date of birth?
Nineteen of the first sixty three.
What's your home address Mr ?
.
"You are charged with an offence which is contrary to section six of the road traffic act in nineteen seventy two  in  Wallby on the ninth of September  drove a motor vehicle  on  the A six seven one  Wallby by pass  having consumed alcohol  in such a quantity that the proportion of it, in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit."
Do you understand?
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Have you got your driving license with you Mr ?
"I haven't got it actually, no."
Why?
"Because, well I told the police at the time  that er  I've misplaced it  and er  my  is."
"What are you doing about getting er, a replacement?"
Well I haven't done anything at the moment because I di I didn't think it was worth it actually.
Oh here comes a nice man with er an injection.
Ah perhaps they're going to give me some vitamins.
Yes.
"And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm, I can't feel anything any more."
Yes it's it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals.
Erm we hate putting animals to sleep.
"In fact it was the Society's policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick, diseased."
Erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please please think before you get a pet.
"Why is it that in the north of England, particularly in this region of the north of England, we seem to be worse than anywhere else?"
I I don't think you are.
Now I've spent seventeen years in Hartlepool and yes that er
They hate monkeys in Hartlepool did you know that?
Found a honkey they monkey
I wasn't going to say anything the Kirkham Hotel.
they hung it.
Er yes and there's one hanging behind their door.
Er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the Society but you know since I've been down in Horsham I have found that the northeast is not alone.
There are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused.
The northeast isn't the only place.
Mm.
Ok thank you very much indeed er Chief Superintendent.
"And Pa Pat I don't think I don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say, Oh that's lovely we'll buy that for  Tommy er, and then Tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say, Well the dog was a a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself."
"May I just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy, we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on Christmas day and say to their elderly relative, We bought you a puppy."
The elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy.
Never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a captive person
Mm.
they've got to look after something.
And this is where the Society is called in er to look after that puppy.
Or just after Christmas usually between Christmas and New Year.
"We're called to waste ground, behind pet shops, a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted puppies, kittens that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before Christmas."
Good Alan thank you very much indeed.
You're very welcome.
"Erm but the idea that someone is putting it all down, all those private conversations, all those tensions, and it's all being recorded, not to present the historic truth, but to present the truth as the person wants history to read it."
"That's what always happens, they're self serving, self pleading, self justifying."
Er perhaps they're helpful to the historians because they can then put them all in a room.
"Although I must say I I mean, one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in, was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident."
And people were very kind about the quality off the speech that I made that that did it.
I believed she was one hundred percent right.
I believed then and I believe now.
I must make that absolutely clear.
"But I had to get together in one room, the admirals, the intelligence people, the civil servants, all the people who'd played a critical role in advising her."
"It was only six months before, they couldn't agree."
I wonder what each of their memoirs would look like.
So what about mrs Thatcher's memoirs?
The timing.
"Well I glanced Yeah, yeah."
"You know, look, I did a deal with Mrs Thatcher in nineteen eighty six, that I wouldn't open up many of these issues, and if she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
But she hasn't.
"As far as I'm concerned, personally, so far, she has."
What was the deal then?
That I wouldn't pursue the issues of nineteen eighty six.
"And I I haven't I  with the No it's very simple, I left it to the select committees of the House of Commons."
"But we're talking about now, we're talking about Mrs Thatcher having written"
I  deal
a set of memoirs er critical of the Prime Minister while he's still in office .
Erm er I'm she hasn't been critical of me.
No but she's been critical of lots of other people.
Well we don't know for sure yet about what she's said about you.
Do we.
If
"That's what I said, If she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
S But but y what what you're saying is that if someo Have you seen the book by the way?
Have you read the book?
Right .
"where, where I found more so were"
that's the oldest part isn't it?
That's the oldest part
That's right on the knife
and the er
"whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer"
and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre
"Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah"
An American oak is not too bad
But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish
Mm
"and it's just only because of the climate, there's er"
"Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was?"
"That's right, yeah, he's, he's"
"Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here"
"this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway"
Oh yeah
as a joiner
Yeah
"and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful"
Yeah
the er
all the

"say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous"
"ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on"
Yeah
"a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there."
It's happening everywhere you see.
"You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er"
"we, we didn't know what was going to happen"
"that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now."
It was the Daily Herald wasn't it?
When it came out first.
Ooh.
Senator Ted Kennedy revealed yesterday that he is to wed lawyer Victoria   who's father is to stand trial over an alleged  fraud.
Kennedy sixty started dating the thirty eight year old divorced mother of two last June.
I love her and her children very much  he said.
"Victoria's father retired   oh he's   father's  Victoria's father, retired judge Edmund  denies fraud ."
The Kennedy's are in  trouble every corner aren't they?
It's nothing to do with him.
"No, but er I mean he's even marrying into trouble."
The whole of his family.
His father and all.
Remand prisoners at a top security jail used a thin mobile phone to make threatening calls to court witnesses it was revealed yesterday.
An astonished guard alerted Durham Jail chiefs when he heard a phone ringing in a cell.
A search revealed the battery operated handset hidden under a mattress.
Calls made from it were traced by police to the homes of witnesses due to give evidence in trials on Tyneside.
At least one case is understood to be involved in a murder charge.
A top level enquiry is underway into the racket.
Dubbed by prison wives the cellnet scandal after the cabinet mobile phones system.
"Visitors are thoroughly searched before they are allowed in to the jail which houses two hundred remand prisoners, killers, I R A terrorists and rapists, and the investigation will examine whether a prison officer may have brought in the phone."
"One senior officer said  it would be extremely difficult to smuggle one in, security is so tight here on visits ."
"Oh well, there's always a lapse isn't there?"
What time does this budget start today I wonder?
Not that we've
What budget?

"Awfully sorry love, have to er dash off a bit"
Erm John
and Jonathan sit down but when I
I want you to read your essay about your home.
Simon  I want you to read about your home as well
and as Martin is still giving out
"I think I'll have you Christopher please to read yours about monster, so I'll have the two monster ones first and then the two home ones."
"Right, just sit down for a minute and let's, Michael read his first."
The monster from the marsh.
I saw the monster arrive from the marsh  he looked at the   when I saw him I ran
The monster from the marsh.
"When I was walking past the marsh one, one night, when I was on my way back from school I heard a rus rustling noise behind a bu bush, when I went up the, went up first to the bush a big dragon-like thing jumped out from behind the bush, it gave me such a fright I nearly fainted."
"I started to run up, straight up the hill, erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and  sticking out of the crowd and he tripped over and after  the end"
My home.
"My home is near the trees and I live there  in, in my house there is"
I have lots of places in my
and I have one  one pigeon and a dog.
"My home is made of wood,"
and the roof is made of tin and the colour of it is grey.
"It has two doors, one, four windows, I, I don't have the garden or, oh, in my house there are six rooms and one of them is er, one, one of them is my, is my room and a picture and a"
"my  my, and"
room and er
My home.
"I live in a tree so does my mum  tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and dad live there."
Our house is made of wood and is dark green.
"We have four windows and four doors, we have got a  there is a big hill in front of it and it is good, but if it, if the tree house   because we find the, the trees and then  and then we were, we play in the tree house sometimes with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture, we have four rooms, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen"
Right then.
"I like erm, Christopher  and Simon"
"yes I know, take your books and show"
"right, erm, Jonathan here"
Haven't really
local wood guides ?
Well Rob's got two
cos I'm just deciding on a new window frame.
And all the firms are claiming that they only get their hardwood from government  erm replanting programmes.
And one got a  stamp and a seal on that.
But whether that is acknowledged by our Friends of the Earth I don't know because I mean they have so many stamps and seals on
They won't give you names now will they?
The Friends of the Earth .
They won't give you names of companies any more.
"No but if this stamp, this acknowledgement."
Oh it's like a little  is it?
good government scheme or not.
Whether that is known  by Friends of the Earth as a good scheme or not.
I think  there's a day of action coming up on this sort of D I Y stuff.
so maybe we'll get some more information about that.
I'm gonna try and get the  book back from Rob.
Martin's an architect and  and it actually probably would be  you know it might be a good thing to actually sort of provoke a question with architects because they do specify these things and they're the ones who actually say  you know right we'll specify hardwood .
It's one of the decisions that are actually made by them in terms of what they use so  erm that could be something that is
Yeah
"round to architects just sort of provoking the question cos they, a lot of them have never thought about it"
Mm.
"and er  you know if they did erm I mean Martin asked about the, he asked about the good wood guide you know and I told them where they can get it but that they can have it in their office and put it in their library."
"You know so that, that's quite a good idea."
Yeah
"But that's so quickly out of date again you see the good wood  cos I mean they they have new government schemes, schemes every year don't they?"
Mm.
And new other schemes.
And
"What, at least it will enable you to know what the tropical species are because some of them have got quite weird and wonderful names and most people don't know what some of them are."
Mm.
I know mahogany is citello .
"I can't do job, it's course work, don't you understand?"
Well
"How am I suppose to copy up course work, it's my own work"
"Do, do you study that at home then?"
What?
A science or something
"Mum it's a tutor period, it means work"
Oh you'll have to work then
don't sit around for an hour doing nothing
I realise that Richard
but don't be stupid
"Look, if you've got work to copy up, why can't you study and work in"
Because he's a tutor
What do you do in it?
I have D R N L As to do
"Mm, I used to let my  when it's tutor period, get on and do some revision work"
Good grief.
"and it's much nicer it, they know what they've got to look at."
"I've got to go and see Wally in tomorrow for the forms, I ain't got any forms to fill in cos I'm officially not leaving, I'm only moving"
"That's right, that's right"
change of address
I don't know it yet
"it will be change, I can't say, is it, I mean I said it's a change of address, they know I'll probably be moved in four to six weeks"
Do get that out of your mouth please
Which is it gonna be?
I'm not signing or changing anything Richard until we have exchanged contracts
"Oh yeah, that's easy muck around do what I do"
"No Richard because the whole thing can fall through  when we have our survey done it might show a defect or something, we might pull out, when they have their survey done it might show a defect so they might pull out, you don't do anything Richard until the contracts have been exchanged, then you can start saying right I think that's, that's, every thing's definite"
Alright  we were doing company law  and
"Mm, mm"
"I was damn good I knew everything, first I had to watch the accounts and secondly I'm looking at all this stuff for when I start my business"
"Mm, mm"
Yeah.
"Yes  I mean it doesn't go down well and I'll  say the things you have to do when you when you're helping to run a club, you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club."
"I mean I date mine, er well I don't date 'em I  I sign the cards at home and do all that at home before I go"
That's right.
and then when I come here I've just got to date  what fish is on the bench.
That's right.
And it cuts down the work then.
The way he's doing this  is there's  they can go.
Well that's no use is it?
That's no use.
I know they were still judging after midnight  and that's no good really  no good at all on a working week.
When we got there we had to  species of fish  and then take it out and
Yeah  yeah.
"It's a good idea  it's a good idea in principle  but, but it's not a workable proposition when you've over a hundred fish  and there's evening"
Yes.
she hasn't got enough time
one of the  didn't come till nearly quarter past ten.
Yeah  yeah.
"I think it er, on reflection I think er I would discourage  members from having a three-way table show  I like the, the one-off  you know, one against one  because it works better"
yeah.
I think it works better.
Yeah.
"Yes of course yeah, but the, you know, we, we have to, I have to make a report and I have to recommend  so I'm recommending  that we forget about the three-way stuff."
"Er, we had a breeders' meeting in October which was  I enjoy them very much, I enjoy the  the talk because it's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen  and I don't have to worry about them generally, in another club, I don't have to worry about minutes or anything, I just sit and listen and it's great  it, I really enjoy that."
"Meetings  once again I have to say  the old, old  chestnut  please can we start at eight o' clock  er we're getting new members who  get a bit discouraged when we have a late start."
"I know it isn't easy  but erm  I think we should  you know, try and we  advertise starting at eight o'clock  and very often there's only Alan and I here at eight."
So if we could all try our best to get here at eight o' clock.
Particularly when we're trying to get juveniles into the club  I mean they want to go at ten possibly  you owe them  not starting till
Yeah  yeah.
It's very difficult to
"nine there's nothing, you know  they'll get discouraged."
"So you  John  now  Jonathan   he's only fifteen, I know he looks in his twenties, but he's only fifteen and he's done a lot of homework  so it makes him  late and it makes him uncomfortable and he's fidgety because he  knows he's got to disturb us when he goes out, he doesn't  doesn't enjoy disturbing us, so  I have to make that clear to you."
This year alone.
"So if you total it up,Be er again and first of all  council  being a, being a council, and they succeeded very well."
"And  at the Leith, South Leith very very well and they just er  district council."
"Was there a lot of that sort of feeling around, that sort of protestant action"
"No no this one man this one, one man in the whole of Edinburgh district council was  protestant tax."
"What er caused them to put that for the  er group forward I could not tell you, but that's what he stood for, this protestant action."
"He was neither Liberal, Labour, Conservative, none of them, he was just, he"
Mm.
What had been a er election representative until
"Er er an election agent,election agent when you're er a er d doing the work of an election agent, you've got to be responsible for all the data going out concerning the running of the election."
"Making sure that your candidate attends every meeting, for er s you know during er an election campaign they've got to attend all the meetings."
"Well the election agent was the man responsible for getting that data through to the, the candidate to say that you're speaking at a meeting, such and such a night, and another meeting at such and such  so keeping the, keeps that candidate on his toes, all the time, during an election campaign until election's over and then of course er you know what  transpires after that I su it's either"
Was you involved in the Labour Party for a long time before erm before you were the election agent?
No.
No no no no.
No n never.
"Of course I had this spell er er don't forget I was five years as a prisoner of war, and  a lot of interest because I was a union member pra b previous to that you see?"
Was this what erm led you to join the Labour Party?
Your initials at a trade union
"Yeah yes, that was er actually yes er"
Mhm.
I wanted to see how it o o operated politically.
I'd heard a lot about er af er I've been in the Transport and General Workers' Union as a shop steward and so forth like that.
That this was interesting me.
"I want to know, find out the workings of it, politically."
What did erm how did you find the Labour Party at that time compares with the Labour Party now?
Oh much better.
W er united.
"It's not united at the present day, there are far too many lefts and rights and centres."
"If there's e if there any  party's operating at all, there's only one p one thing and that's centre."
"No lefts, no rights, centre."
United.
Now let's move along the line.
"Erm any any questions on er  itself or you know if there's anything I haven't told you, I mean there's probably quite a lot, well there's a lot I know there is."
But yes anything you want to er erm please jump in.
"Er but if not let's move up erm to towards er towards , and this is erm this is the erm former under-bridge at , going up to Mill."
Now the roadway used to come under the railway.
"Little humpback, bridge here, erm and used I say used to go through to  er Mill itself just er quarter of a mile along the track."
"Erm the er the road was later just moved to the left hand side of that bridge, and er no longer having to have that restriction."
But that is still in place as you can see.
"Er a fairly light railway, erm but er but adequate."
That's taken from just re wh basically where the roadway is now.
And that's the trail looking towards .
"Now let's move up to the next port of call, which is  Station."
I should say it's convenient for neither I should imagine.
Erm single track shown on this ordnance survey map.
"Again about nineteen er I think nineteen fifteen, maybe a little bit earlier."
"Erm a passing loop there, for trains to be able to just pull in and let anything going the other way, because it was mainly single track from er from  onwards."
Erm and a little bay there for er goods traffic to go into the sort of station.
"Station platform, the bridge there, and the station master's house, there."
A little head shunt at the end to protect anything running back onto the er main line.
Erm slightly nearer picture.
Er and I think erm er a bit later date actually.
No it's probably about the same.
"That one's a bit later date, and you can see that they've double the track here."
"Erm just made it a er does it's not double track er very far, but they have actually double tracked that."
And this is erm in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties.
When there was a fair amount of er goods traffic particularly coal from .
That er that line I think went to just er a bit further up and erm er I say not an any matter of er another couple of hundred yards I think before there was only a single track.
Er that is the station master's house at  Station.
And er it's now the part of the  you can er go to a picnic area along here.
You know you can walk through there back to .
You can just see the remains of the platform there.
And er platform over here.
Any idea what gas might be being produced?
No I was trying to think  it's zinc.
And it's in a basin of hydrogen
Zinc and nitrate.
and it would give off  nitrate wouldn't it?
Zinc nitrate?
Which isn't a gas.
Which isn't a gas.
It's a salt.
So perhaps some odd hydrogen is produced as well.
Well that sometimes happens when there's
Two minutes?
Right.
Yeah I think the two minutes is up.
David's timed two minutes.
Now when that acid is  fresh and hasn't been used before  two minutes is usually quite enough for it to have done the  job it's supposed to do.
"This is an imprecise  operation because  since the acid has been used I don't know how many times  because the temperature, the ambient temperature in the room varies."
"In the winter when it's cold it works more slowly  now when it's very hot it will, should work more quickly."
Er I can't say precisely  leave it in the acid for so and so time.
"So we always  this has always been the case for the four  five hundred years that people have been doing etching, so they go by a rule of thumb."
"The rule of thumb is this  when the first cluster of bubbles is fully formed, sweep them away with a bird's wing feather."
So  I have duly swept them away.
Which means that the acid can get back in there.
"That the air bubble er the gas bubble, I keep saying air bubble, that's wrong."
They are gas bubbles.
The gas bubbles forming along the lines were keeping the acid out of the lines.
So I've swept them away so that the acid can get back in.
When the second set of bubbles is formed  it's done.
That's the rule of thumb.
Okay?
Two formations of bubbles and it's bitten deep enough.
So I suppose that was about two and a half minutes wasn't it?
"M m yes, they talked about work  or work , and erm, but not about conditions particularly, and  was a medium pit for conditions."
"They talked about conditions at  which was a wet pit, and er how Hucknall was much better, anyhow and things like that."
But great talk about Union activities.
What were the Union activities?
"Er well, there was the highly immoral thing called overtime, erm if you had too much overtime you was keeping someone out of job."
Er you wanted a fair number of hours and you wanted a fair wage.
Er the Union was very  parochial .
Mm.
So the men in the house were all members of Nottingham Miners Association?
Yes.
What about the General Strike?
I suppose the strike would be an early
Well
memory for you?
Yeah.
"The General Strike,it's a strange memory  because I had to walk down  Pad er now, erm I forget what the proper word is now, er it's called  Walk, now ."
"sounds terr er terrible to me,because  Pad was the way to  Colliery, the last half mile along a dirt track."
"And er Granddad  was on maintenance, of course, and I used to have to take his meals, so I used to go past the er picket, along with many other people who were busy coal  out of the pit tip ."
"Er the picket was not as militant as it is now, and there were the talks of scabs, and things like that."
"But the Strike was, well we had the pit ponies up, and er we always used to go and feed them, and then we went, of course, to chapel for meals."
"I won't say soup kitchens because they weren't that at all, I mean, they weren't as civili You had a civilized meal, I know you sang grace before it, and said grace afterwards, but you had knifes, forks and spoons and chapel china."
Mm.
So how?
Do you remember how your grandfather and father felt about the Strike?
"Erm yes, they er, they felt they'd been let down by the Railway men, I think, or someone else at the beginning at the Strike, and they were out on a limb but er they'd got to make the best of it."
Mm.
Erm I think they thought they'd been let down at the end of it.
"Erm I was taken to h hear A J , the miners leader at the time, he was the best type perhaps, a Welsh Chapel Parson, erm on the recreation ground and on the marketplace, when thousands turned up,"
Mm.
attend .
"How how did people feel about , because well if you read read Alan Alan  book, then he's criticized very strongly as being too militant, and r well really Cri preferred to him."
How how did the the  miners?
"The seventy nine of you who voted for banning hunting,a are you all townees, do you not understand th the fabric of er, of the country?"
"Do you have an alternative to offer that would er, that would sustain that fabric?"
Yes?
"I live in the country, I live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm, and there's no co , no message at all from the farmer that  foxes are a pest  it's a misnomer put about by the hunt."
"Fox hunting was started, two hundred, three hundred years ago by the aristocracy because there wasn't enough deer, because the fo the forests were getting obliterated by the same pi , the same people, it was started as an entertainment, it's an entertainment now!"
"And now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing, they're saying it's pest control, they're saying, we do it, it's quick, it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck."
It's not!
"The hunt encourages foxes into their land  they actually build artificial earths, we saw one of Saturday when we were out protesting, the ar , they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them."
A hunt is no good without foxes.
They don't want foxes
Alright.
"to be depleted at any way, they encourage them!"
So you actually go out and do something about
Yes.
your your your er  your feelings?
Wha what do you do as a protester?
"We actually, I'm actually er, in the Scottish Action Against Blood Sports"
Aha.
"and we do many things, we write to MP's, we write to councils trying to get them banned off the land, and we've been very successful."
"We've actually helped stop the  oldest hunt in Scotland, in Li Lithgo in Stirlingshire, which ended last year."
We were very successful then and we've now  progressed.
"We go out every single Saturday, weekdays if we can, and we try and stop the  stop the fo , hounds killing the foxes"
So
peacefully.
"so so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in, in Scotland?"
Very!
Right.
I'd like to disagree with that.
Ah.
"I'm an ex-master's wife from Lithgo in Stirlingshire hunt, and we had to stop because erm  the country was disappearing underneath us."
We had a new
Mm.
"It's not, how I prosper financially."
"It's not, whether I'm in good health."
"It's not whether,a , whether I've all my little  itty-bitty prayers answered."
God's blessing to me  is life forever.
That's his blessing to you.
It's not making a list.
"It's not giving you  total health, and free you from all sickness and diseases."
It's not answering all your prayers.
It's not making your life easy.
It is giving you life forever!
That is the blessing!
That is his big parcel he's given to you.
It's wrapped up in a .
", thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!"
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Those disciples, they had the storm stilled for them  and it got  easier sailing."
It was plain sailing then to the other side.
"They were more comfortable, it was a, it was a more enjoyable journey, and let's be honest  if I can go through life without hassles and without problems my life will be more enjoyable, of course it and these difficulties, and these storms coming away, coming your way your life will be more enjoyable."
"But like the disciples, it will not be any better, or any safer."
Their safety did not depend on the storm being still.
Their security and safety depended on Jesus being with them.
That was it!
"Your safety, and your security and my safety and security in life  does not depend on how pleasant my ways are and how pleasant my paths are  how much I manage to amass, and how I can overcome all the little difficulties and problems and  steer clear of the big ones  the security and safety of my life, now and in eternity,security is there in the boat  and lying with him."
"See, the real peace  is not the stilling of the storm  the real peace is that the assurance of who is going to stop it."
That's the promise to your eternal life.
I will never leave you.
"You don't understand the circumstances, you don't understand the storm    I might , I might not  leave that to me he says  I will be with you."
I will never leave you.
I will never forsake you  even to the end of the .
Well let's see
Come in.
"town built in our country with two motorways, and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up, it was nothing to do with our friends the  saboteurs."
"It was creeping suburbia then, it wasn't"
Creeping suburbia.
So wha
Yes.
"what do you do now with the, what do the old  the old hunt's people do?"
"Well we've, we just have to er, grin and bear it."
There is nowhere else to go for us.
Yes.
I would like to ask the saboteurs how they can justify  the fact that they ill-treat hounds and horses?
Now I
personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by saboteurs!
I feel this is cruelty to horses.
Yes.
"That's, that's just absolutely rubbish!"
I mean we don't
Well you
"can't, you can't"
"like er, you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe"
Generally speaking
Mm.
"erm, I mean  people who spend their entire Saturday doing something that they, I mean, I don't enjoy going out every Saturday!"
"I mean, I'd like to do the things that, my hobbies, but I go out there because I care and I see that I feel that it's necessary to, to actually stop these people tormenting an animal for fun  and if I'm that concerned about animals, I'm not gonna stoop to  to hurt a horse, or  or the hounds!"
"I mean I ride myself, I have dogs myself, I mean, it's just another excuse from the hunting fraternity, turn it round, blame the cruelty on the saboteurs when really  there wouldn't be any saboteurs if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun!"
Do you want to come back on that?
Yes.
"Erm we ha , we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that I would ask the speaker  who i , what"
Mm.
or who is the fox's predator?
"After all, the mouse has a cat, so what is the fox's predator?"
Do you know much about fox ecology?
Yes.
And so how can the Communist Party
But I mean
"just say right, we're gonna do this, this"
Just because they don't know what it  socialism
"theoretical concept or something, they might have known that they wanted"
Yes but it's the basic underlying concept
capitalism and becomes rich as the we western world then th they'll be all for that
"No, I just find that  really difficult  because they didn't have the means at that time to achieve it."
"I mean we've already established the fact they didn't have, they didn't have the personnel to"
.
Yes they did.
They were in power.
They were in power but I mean who's to say that the pe there's not gonna be a civil war and they'll be thrown out of power.
So why did they think that they had the er  means to do it in nineteen forty seven?
"You know when they said, when they went for a very radical policy"
Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they're becoming more realist but they're still  erm I mean they're learning from their past mistakes and they've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism.
They're not totally contradicting their ideals.
Oh yeah
It confirms our suspicions
at the last gasp we were right.
It's all this absolute power corrupts actually isn't it?
Mm.
"Erm the, the people who  did Mao ?"
Or ?
"Well I mean  there, there, there's no question about nineteen forty nine absolutely non no documents  could have come out unless they had Mao's approval."
Mm.
Er
Did he shoot the other people involved by any chance?
that's behind this
Right.
erm
I E it's the same person who comes up with
It doesn't make sense to buy the cheapest brand of baked beans to save a few pence.
It's true.
So then fill your car tank at the most expensive petrol station  in town.
"If you're going to make economies , make efficient ones."
"Similarly, if you are going to be extravagant, be so in an a area,where you're actually going to see the benefit"
So you see
Ha
I told you you should have those two pairs of shoes.
happiness will come to all Virgos  who aim the right arrows at the right targets this weekend .
"Gearoid, what are you?"
It depends.
"It is the nineteenth of February, which one does it fall on theirs?"
Pisces or  Aquarius?
Pisces.
"Aquaria , Aquarius."
Mhm.
"so the term a minor crime I, I don't think is a very good one to be using."
"mm, yes"
I was actually mugged on holiday er then years ago and I was held up with a gun and it was the most horrendous feeling
where was that?
"in Barbados and er some young chaps had saw me lying on the beach and er they stole my bag and they stuck a gun in my face and freeze lady, you don't do any thing, you just let them take what they want and its a horrible feeling when your there, we were there for three weeks and it just totally spoiled the holiday but the ramifications of it don't just stop once you got on the plane home, it was very frightening"
"well your talking about it now and, and with a degree of emotion, do you still feel it?"
"oh, it was feel , it was so terrifying, you just, you regard every one with suspicion after that."
"mm, mm"
"I actually feel, there was a time I used to think it wouldn't happen to me because if I was in that situation I would do this, I would do the next thing and when it did actually happen to me  it took me ages to get over"
mm
the trauma because your so helpless and
"what was, what was the it can I ask that happened?"
mm
I mean if you don't want to say its alright
"no, I don't particularly want to say"
yeah
Erm o a barrow crossing er between platforms there.
There's a engine or carriage co er couple of carriages in there.
The gates are shut over there.
Signal box there.
"Er the er station master's house, the line disappearing off towards  over there."
"Erm  's Mill along here, and actually, you can actually just see there's a wagon there which says, L B S C."
"Now that's London, Brighton and South Coast."
What on earth's that doing there?
Er but er maybe it was erm collecting or delivering a load or something.
Er there you have the weighbridge.
"Er or weigh office, and again pretty little building, er the steeply pitched roof, the barge- boarding on it, erm and er multi-coloured er brick, there's a sort of whitish brick with erm er sort of pinkish er brick work er put in to er b by way of decoration."
And again you've got the same sort of thing.
That's the coal er th the the coal offices.
"There were three, well there we were in fact four coal merchants in the in the town."
"there was er  's, erm  's who were probably the biggest, Samuel  's, erm  's and  s."
"Erm I think that  's had gone out of the coal merchanting business erm probably by nineteen twenty or earlier, I think."
I haven't been able to trace anything er later than that.
"There you've got er a line of coal wagons, and so that's those'll be coming that is a more sort of general merchandise wagons which would be parked in there, loaded or unloaded, erm er shunted across the lines and er into that goods yard, goods shed for er loading and so on."
"Erm lamps, kerosene, wicks and all the rest of it would be kept there."
"Gentlemen's toilet, there."
"Erm and the driveway, er over there."
And again as I say it's rather a nice erm picture which erm er was given to me some time ago.
"A close up really, just showing you er more detail on er that wagon turntable, the buffer stops, rail built buffer stops, or just across there, fire buckets."
Erm and er there's the er loading gauge and there of course is the whitewashed erm cattle dock.
"Er and er so there's  the goods shed and the er door, the wooden door to provide excess er trucks into there."
"Er another picture I say really just erm closer up, erm and giving perhaps better detail."
You can see the er the pattern of the darker brickworks.
There's the sort of pinkish bricks.
"And again you can see the barge-boarding erm and rather attractive roof designs, er which er reflect er the rest of the architecture."
"Some of the some of the railways were very very functional, not and didn't bother too much about er what places looked like."
Railway was.
"Er they perhaps spent too much money that way, but to be fair, the  Railway was the biggest Well the  Railway  er on amalgamation in nineteen twenty three, was the biggest company, and biggest employer in this country."
Yes
So I asked if they wanted anything and she said a bed at the cottage hospital
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds
Oh you mean a bed?
You mean a special kind of mattress?
Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
"She just said a bed, so I told her there were special beds that we are very useful in fact very necessary in  cases and we tend to be short of them"
Ah ha
and a  bed costs two thousand pounds.
There's another one  can't remember the name of which costs a lot more
Ah ha
Something like five thousand .
"Anyway, I said I'd make enquiries as to what was wanted and I said because there's a new children's ward will open at the  hospital and perhaps they would ."
So I saw Mrs  and Mrs  said they were aiming to raise money for scanner appeal
Yes
They're also going to have a obstetric  department  first time
A what?
Obstetric and patients
Yes
and that obviously they would be tend to be other children with mother's there so they would need perhaps a play facility there and other children who goes to the E N T clinic can go to the  not just go to the outpatients  casualty
Yes
There's very limited facilities for children to play with.
"So, but I also approached Mrs Earl about a ."
"Anyway, she wanted me to go and see her."
"She said there was the scanner appeal, the  talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and there's an arts appeal and for arts facilities in hospital and all sorts of things."
"So I went back to Miss White and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that would be the best idea, not the ."
"I also told here it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital and the children from  invited to the hospital that day, that week sorry, it's gonna be a week in June so she wanted to know the details so I asked Mrs  t would she write to Miss White and give her all the details but she thought it would be far better if she went to see her and explain it all."
"She was going on Wednesday, I hope she went."
"Hold on, which one was going to see which one?"
Mrs  was going to see Miss White
What on liquidated damages?
Next.
Shut up .
"S safe, okay."
"Procedure K zero stop one, safety related admin."
"I'm making the point that man management procedures erm, sorry, safety instructions and information and safety information will not be issued via management procedures."
"Management procedures w will relate, will only contain procedures relating to the admin of safety matters."
Yes.
Good.
Excellent
Go back to the clerical section
"You, you'll, you were instrumental about"
I've been fighting this b
that my friend.
I've been fighting this battle for four years and we've eventually got there.
Mm.
Good.
Good.
Next.
It was
Erm maintenance and use of portable electrical apparatus K nineteen stop one.
The safety one.
Er it talks about erm
Safety admin one.
Safety admin one.
"The functions clerical section, section maintaining registers."
Business and planning manager will ensure a contract's in place for routine inspection.
"Business, and business manager will ensure that inspection reports are forwarded to the function heads after inspections."
And there's talking about labelling of defective equipment and what have you.
Good.
And I've been ordered to .
Right.
Don't tell him blue eyes
Oh dear.
"I know that's not funny, but, it is funny."
It is
"Ryan just revels in anybody who's been naughty, he think he really is spite which I think is a bit frightening in a child, really."
It is because he'll be
Yeah
Looks to  just led into
"Yeah, he is, he's very easily led, Ryan, you know, and he's very into, you know, getting on with the gang."
Which is really sad.
"But erm, he's a little shit."
"Called me, he's called me a college crappy, he goes why don't you go back, he goes, why don't you go back to college, you college crappy."
"He went, you're just a drop-out, you're just sponging off the government."
"I was like, shut up, Ryan."
"He's like, I know your sort."
fourteen.
Yeah.
"But the sad thing is, he's got he's got quite a bit of brain, ain't he, to come out, you know, little things like, although they're rude, he's obviously aware, but he's wasting it all, ain't he?"
I know.
Quite intelligent.
"It's like, what was he, he was going, oh that's right,he keeps going, I can't, but they're cold now  but he was like, at the dinner table once, right, and Ryan and Gran argue continuously, and he was going erm, and he went, Gran, and Gran went, yeah, and he went, do you know what you are, and Gran went no, and he went, well, I can't remember what it's called, he goes, they're this, I think it's a hybrid, he goes, you're a hybrid."
"He goes, do you know what one of them is, he goes, it's just sort of like evolutionary thing between the ape and man, and he goes, it's sort of part way between, and it's sort of like some sort of creature, and it's half like an ape and half like a human, and he goes, and you're one of them  he goes, you're one of them Gran, he goes, you've got a brain like one of them, as well, and Gran just like went  oh shut up Ryan."
She doesn't really know what to say.
"Oh, shut up Ryan, and then he sits there for a bit,and she goes, yeah well, you used to wear national health spectacles."
"Ha ha ha  and Ryan goes, oh shut up Gran."
"But he's like, when they think they can get any little thing they can think of to wind each other up."
It was so amusing.
"But it just go Ryan is, you know, he's a bright boy."
"Yeah, I know, it's sad ain't it?"
"But like,Mi Miss  said to me, when I went up there, she said, ah I know, she said, you hear a lot of bad stuff about Ryan, she said, but he's a nice, he's a nice little boy really, and she said, he's very polite, he's very polite, he can be very polite to you."
"She said, and a lot of the time, she said, he's a, he's a little sod, she said, but you know, she said, I mean, it's not all bad things about him, and I said, I've been hearing things about you from Miss , and she  oh, what she's been bloody saying, I bet she's been saying I'm crap at English."
Yeah well .
I didn't say what the license is.
we only insure for the intrinsic value of
And is there any situation
the item.
That's all.
Right.
But you guarantee them delivery.
Yep.
On the piece of paper.
I know but you've lost the .
We give them their money back.
"I mean, well it'll probably arrive, it'll turn up somewhere won't it really?"
But se
Could do.
"I mean send another one is what we're saying, have your money back."
If you haven't got the  you should be okay.
Or
"if it arrived, if you paid for a before"
One customer should expect it to arrive then
noon  and it er
"I mean, same ta super mail, we wouldn't give them their money back."
I think that's a bit more than that now.
"But if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon, we would just give you the money difference the before twe , ten thirty and the before noon price, not the complete price."
Unless you wanted to argue about it.
"But we feel that, okay, you know, it may have been a half an hour late but you got there."
"And therefore, we have incurred cost and therefore, but okay, it wasn't the guaranteed service."
"But you could argue with us, you know."
"And again, a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account."
"But we don't, you've gotta be careful as you probably know Phil, the abuse can of the ca , you know, carrier, you know, can be a nice little earner if you're not careful."
"And, you know, erm people can  intend to fail in order to claim money, revenue back, and so on."
D'ya know
"Or damaged goods can, you know, put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable."
So potentially two nights out of the four.
Does it have an address Helen?
No it's through  erm
Right I just wondered if she gave you an address cos it you know got a super little town map here.
If I was being cynical I'd volunteer Mark's car to get people to and from the town.
If it was a long way out.
Well he said that was a possibility but I really  so.
But then again .
Erm but then it starts getting very very silly.
I mean this is basically she's she already books some flats and house a house because self-catering accommodation's in such short supply because of long lets over the winter.
Do we need to proceed on this now.
Do we need to see if we can draw up an extra .
I think one of the ideas behind the the party chipping in on this is because it would be extremely convenient for people who are popping in at the last minute for
Mm.
for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least kip on the floor.
Where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive B and B because all the cheap places have gone.
So to a certain extent the idea was to that if we had the thing worked out it would be of great benefit to the people who were popping by.
Erm whereas at this stage the four of us could probably find accommodation which wasn't that much more expensive erm but to have the actual focus for the for the local party .
Could we have  people to pay the six pound a night and erm you know  a hundred and forty four to start with and just ask people to pay the six pound a night anyway and just get as much back as we can?
Yeah yeah.
Cos six pound a night isn't bad.
It's less than we pay in Wolverhampton .
Oh it's very reasonable yes.
It would be possible I suppose with the commitment of people  for the local party to make  on the committee.
I mean I have a couple of ideas.
I was going to ask Mike  if he wants to come as an observer because he's never been to conference and erm
And when it comes
he was talking about spending a weekend with us anyway so it might be nice thing to do.
When it comes to that though there will be people from other green parties who who'll be looking for accommodation so at the last minute we can
Dick  for example.
Yeah.
We're hoping that we'll
.
"and I had, got  pick up two so I, I just had to give up, I phoned him up when I got here, apologise, he hasn't been in touch with Michael yet, I don't know why not, er, though why, er sorry"
"Erm, there used to be ."
"Sorry, there used to be a group at the College I think."
"Yes, yes."
"Well there used to be that's right,with you John,talking about college group just about that time ."
"Erm  yes and it's, it's funny thing I haven't sent things to the College with, with the other stuff that went out, but, er we have, I have spoken to Michael about College, yeah I mean ."
"So we didn't, yeah well if we've got someone's who's interested in starting a group, that's the time which to start, we did, yeah, but there was a group, er previous thing but I think that, there was one girl who was very er keen, but I think when she left it probably lapsed."
"Mm,"
But.
"yeah, yeah, I did, did discuss it with Michael, I'd forgotten that, I just remembered now ."
"Maybe, maybe I don't know if he's shy or anything, why he hasn't phoned up Michael yet, perhaps I ought to ask Michael to phone him then, he does , yes."
"Maybe, yes , we have, we have approved school or er student group officer so we should perhaps let him  you know, perhaps we should, perhaps we should come back to him or Michael could."
Mm.
"Well, shouldn't, shall I"
"Should imagine, mm."
"take that number from you, cos I'll, I'm probably going, probably be seeing Michael this week,."
Do you want the letter?.
"Yes, okay."
"Right, that's fine, well I, that would be very good if there was a group at the coll at the coll at the college, there ought to be one at the college"
Mm.
"of all, of all the"
Mm.
you know.
"Oh, he's only, he's only there till September till"
"Oh, great."
"he's only there till the Summer, by the way."
"Yes, well perhaps we could get it going quickly then"
.
"Right, erm, now, er, do you want to say something?"
"I did, yes, erm, when erm, we thought our prisoner was finished the co-ordinators wrote to me and said would I be interested, would our group be interested in erm, writing to Yugoslavia's still, because with the Civil War going on there's lots of cases coming up, for example there was a whole hospital full of patients that were taken prisoner  I don't know if they were actually physically removed or whether they were held in the hospital without access to medical treatment for something like ten days, and erm, Saria did say she'd help me last time and I wrote back and said yes, two of us could write once a month, well they're taken that very liberally  and, and, got two or three things from the already and erm, if anyone else is interested in writing an odd letter say once a month to Yugoslavia maybe they could erm, let me know later on.."
"Good, that's fine, right, any other business?"
yes
"yeah fine, okay great thanks."
Sarah.
I work  my main aim on this course is to gain confidence
right
I don't do many presentations mainly because I work in a small team
"right, right so it's about confidence Great thanks."
Bob
Senior  Midland area and I've been working on a job in  Coventry which is basically  work er what I hope to get mainly out of this course is an increased level of personal confidence so I can overcome basic nervousness when speaking.
"how to handle the nerves, I'll say right now and half of you may want to walk out of the room."
I don't have a magic wand I do not have a magic wand that you know take three deep breaths turn round twice and your nerves will disappear yep.
"So if that's what wanting   we've got problems straightaway erm but certainly we will discuss what to do about that yes and to recognise them and to understand why, yes, fine but I don't have a magic wand."
I'd I'd be a millionaire if I did wouldn't I?
Rob .
Senior Engineer for Midlands area I'm er presently on  seventeen million pound office development  the job's  completion  erm my presentations are basically from site labour to erm professional engineers and architects
yep
on a one to one basis or or to small meetings
Mm
What I hope to gain on the course is to be able to speak more confidently and to get over the nerves.
"right, great thanks."
Gordon
"Senior Engineer for Midlands region, currently been working on the  developments which is design built and  development gangs of which"
yep
erm I have er one to one dealing with subcontractors engineers the architects and site meetings not a great preparation but there is
more or less every day to day
right
erm I hope to get out of this more personal confidence and more  talk more clearly
So it's to be clear in what you're saying to be able to explain yourself clearly so it's about clarity
right
"The need to make it clear so that people understand without having to sort of keep coming back and asking again and again, yep, great, thanks."
John
I'm  I'm the senior  south west I currently work  schemes my main aim on the course is er to gain more confidence
And could British Rail be sold to British Rail?
We've learned that the government can't rely on enough support from its own back benchers to push through privatization on its own terms.
And why should Chinese ancestor worship appeal to government ministers.
John Cole returns from the seaside with answers to the questions you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask.
But first Michael Heseltine.
"He's been a force in British politics for a third of a century, but for how much longer."
We've heard nothing from him for the past four months since that heart attack in Italy.
"Though the rumours have told us a great deal, he's still far from well, he might need a heart bypass, he's gonna have to retire form politics."
"At the very least, his influence over the party and British politics is at an end."
"Well it didn't sound at all like any of that when I spoke to M Mr Heseltine, near his home, a couple of hours ago."
"I asked him first, How are you?"
I'm well.
"Er medically, as best as I understand what the doctors tell me, er I'm er fine to carry the responsibilities and strain of er the cabinet job that I had."
But you have to do it g slowly.
Take it a step at a time.
It'd be crazy to sort of do a dive in from the sort of recuperative process.
"But er er the er one of the doctors who looked inside my heart They put a local injection, telescope upside, he said I've got the arteries of a man of thirty or forty."
Don't don't quarrel with him.
Don't quarrel with him .
So what does that mean?
No need for a bypass?
Because they
No no no no I just lost the tip of an artery.
"Closed down, finish."
So there's it w it wasn't close to the heart.
And so there's n the arteries themselves are very good.
"But this tip for reasons beyond my knowledge has gone so there's nothing to be done about it and erm er the last test I had the guy who conducted it said, You've already got the heart off an average sixty year old who hasn't had a heart attack."
And that sort of is very encouraging.
So you're completely fit er
Medically yes.
Er but it takes time to recover from the er the the shock and the experience and the unnerving.
But I've come a long way and er so I'll go back next er Wednesday to the department and er er if people will bear with me and put up with it er I'll take it er fairly slowly to start with but I dare say there will come a time when er erm you won't notice much difference.
Whilst there's a world economic malaise.
"Not sure you can blame the media altogether, I noticed you said there in almost these words er, John Major will the lead the Conservative party into the next election and the Conservatives will win."
You said exactly that I quote word for word in November nineteen ninety and a week later what happened?
You challenged Mrs Thatcher and brought her down.
Well it's interesting that er I mean these quotations get It must be very clever research.
Well you offered it.
"Yeah well okay, well I haven't I mean, I I did I did actually think that Mrs Thatcher would lead us into the election."
"Er I thought that it was wrong that she should, as everybody knows."
Er and I think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party.
That was my view and still my view and I think John Major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the pundits it has to be said.
er I hope I did everything I could to help.
As I did Mrs Thatcher.
Nobody worked harder in the nineteen eighty seven general election than I did.
Yeah but the point I'm making is that you thought that would happen then.
You say it may happen it is going to happen now.
Why should we believe it now any more than we believed it then .
"Well I I I mean there i thinking back, I didn't think at that stage, I hope I'm right about this,th that I had any idea that Geoffrey Howe was going to resign."
I never had the slightest intention of challenging Mrs Thatcher.
There was never my my view and and one day I shall if I ever get round to it I might set this all out.
My view was
Write your memoirs?
Yeah.
"In nineteen eighty six, my view was a very very clear one."
To survive.
I mean nobody thought I could do that.
I mean not many people who'd clashed with mrs thatcher did survive.
"But I did, that was my determination."
"John Major is beset with problems, you wouldn't"
Yeah.
argues that.
"In fact you said er again if if I may offer you one of your quotes erm, If you have back benchers who won't support you, that limits governments abilities to take decisions."
you said that a few months ago.
"No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us"
Oh
said the stuff you're using is
Rubbish
"old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?"
Mm
You know
"that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?"
"And that, and this, you kept getting this er"
"Oh no you, you can use this, but you"
oil through
"don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that."
Oh
"His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can"
Mm
"put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet"
So just use wax to build up the polish
"waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see"
Mm
but you can
"that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to"
"Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?"
That's already done innit?
"Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about"
"He started just after me, yeah"
"one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the"
"I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards  that'll be each one of those holes, he"
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the
yes
or
"well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand"
he will
"No, he did that."
Ah!
"I suppose if you get, when you get there  everything'll be alright."
But  it was your idea of erm  entrances that got me a bit scared.
From the top more  from the top.
Top.
"Yeah, but just sa say, if you come from th the top you, you're like a  a waist thing round you and if you fall off that'll catch you."
So what do you think?
About the entrance?
Can I have a ?
You could come down on the  the first half and I can jump   and that's like   Wrestle Mania.
Mm.
Mm.
But our feet will come down like that.
Put it this way Trace  I am more petrified than  about this than you are.
That would be a nightmare!
Will it?
Rod Stewart on the  ooh!
"Notices for you, first of all those of you who are on the Committee ."
"Any er ideas you've got  you've got, please pass on to the Committee member  Thursday dinner time."
The only other er notice I've got for you is that tomorrow I forgot to put it on the notices  tomorrow we've got a lot of visitors in school  there's about er thirty five of them coming over who are likely to be joining us in the lower sixth next September er  lessons with the lower sixth to find out what erm  what  lessons are like you know okay.
"Now do welcome them, do make them feel at home, especially those of you who are new to the place you will know and remember what it's like when you first come into a strange building that feels like home."
"Okay, so erm do  them and then if they're lost on practical things like they don't know where the toilet is will you help them."
and er
Thank you the only  is that you will have seen  organised  generally supported that although I think we could support it a lot better than we have.
So er think about that and remember
"It's a different format Mr Dexter this time, we're not having maths we're having a ten minute  and that will be followed by a concert ."
"It's a completely different format, so you might  might like to come to that  okay."
Erm  this morning we have er another visitor and  who actually was a teacher and works at  at a very senior position er heading er very interesting projects to technical location educations  and I would like to er introduce you to Mr
Good morning everybody.
It's about er ten years ago nearly that I er stopped being a teacher and when I was a teacher er  up having to do assemblies er it was always something that I did with great reluctance and er was er pleased if I could get other people to do it er it seems rather odd then er that I've actually said yes coming to do er an assembly here today and it's perhaps a sign of mental instability on my part.
Give over one of the rooms to  people .
When is it?
It's er the first weekend in March.
Anyway shall we
Okay shall we move on.
Do you want to tell us all about the stall for for the energy conservation bill?
Certainly.
Yeah the stall was extremely successful.
We kicked off at eleven and went on till three and there were I think six people stuffing er in the course of the day Bob Andy Mark and myself and Chris .
A late showing from the man himself.
And erm I was particularly pleased to get Chris along because he was extremely effective.
Erm what we were doing was filling in these these postcards asking MPs to turn up on February the fourth to support the energy conservation bill when it has its er second reading in Parliament.
"And erm it was ex ex it was great having Chris along because erm he went out and grabbed everybody in the street, pulled them in onto the stall and er and got them got them to sign on the dotted line so to speak."
Er he came along after the the Heworth Green er demonstration.
Which he described incidentally as a bit of a damp .
And they all they all ran away very soon after the press left.
So so he came along and did some work for us.
Apart from that erm the scores on the doors forty six postcards were sent out which doesn't sound perhaps like very many but is in fact quite a lot of work when you're having to find people who's who people's MPs are for them and so on.
And we were we covered sixteen different MPs which is especially good news because Hugh Bailey normally supports the bill and as far as we know is likely to turn up and and vote for it.
But getting out to MPs like erm John Prescott the energy spokesperson for the Labour Party and so on.
And John Gummer.
John Gummer right yeah.
Lots of people who are marginal erm we don't know erm ourselves if if they're intending.
So this might help tip the balance.
And because  in with it it's a national campaign.
It's er it's all all to the good.
And so it's keeping up the the good work that's of of lobbying MPs to such a degree that they they've got to back it which is what's brought it to its second reading as one of the most popular er private member's bills in history.
Erm we received eleven pounds eighty seven in donations.
Er the cost of stamps was eight pounds seventy four and therefore our profit
profit was  three pounds thirteen pence .
Not bad for somebody who thought it was going to  cost us money .
So people gave us money for the stamps that we put on and other people gave us donations.
Yeah.
then she said do you know these last six months we do nothing but argue  she said we've never argued so much!
Yeah.
And she said oh I think it's only the pressure.
Well that's right.
"I said well me and Geoff argue more, I said we never used to  cos we never argued a lot did we?"
No.
Well we have done  I felt sorry cos I hadn't really  when she phoned me up over there I was up  I thought oh my God!
"Yeah,"
"Cos I'm a bit worried we gotta get things sorted out  so I rang  I said I didn't to get onto you, she said no I know how they feel  she said  her granddad always do things like that."
What?
You know break appointments  I said well that only worries
it ain't quite the same is it?
well I said I suppose Geoff couldn't get away.
Well they just wouldn't let me
"I said that that worried m that really sort of worried me  so I rung her back anyway, she's alright."
"Well, you don't wanna worry about them because at the end of the day, I mean if  if that was absolutely desperate I shall turn round and say well I'm sorry I've bloody got to and that's it!"
"You know, but I mean"
But you must go Wednesday Geoff!
Yeah  No
And she been
"it was  they was that panicking cos tomorrow morning, the ministry are coming  and"
Yeah.
they was panicking.
"We all it is ba , well I say all it is  this bloody great strip right be between the ceiling and the walls, the right length of corridor and the manager see it and he said look  that should be shiny sort of like   and it's all pitted  so he said you'll have to go up here he said and do it all with steel abrasive  said fair enough."
"So of course I, took me about half hour to find the forklift cos somebody had nicked it  by time I went got the chemicals Robin comes down, he said oh don't worry about he said do i do it tomorrow morning he said, they'll be nobody about then  can you go down the bot bottom and do the butterflies?"
"I felt well  bloody marvellous, you now,i it was that imperative it had gotta be done, you can't have time o no I'm sorry you can't!"
So you could of gone to that appointment tonight?
"Well, well no, no because it was then about, that's what I'm is, then four o'clock you see, so I mean I knew I wouldn't make it anyway  that's why I thought I'd better ring  cos the job that we finished was half past three so I thought well even if I come home  I shall be late even if I don't get changed and washed or anything."
Yeah well you can't go there not washed and changed.
No that's what I thought I was
But you got an appointment fo you could of had one for tomorrow but I thought Wednesday is a better day I thought.
Well I mean I I know what Barbara feels about this.
"She feels that  erm  at the, the level that we are working at it is really coun be counter productive to hold stock."
Because however hard you try stock deteriorates.
Yeah.
Erm but I you know I feel that that very often we don't sell stock
Well couldn't we just have a few things
and I feel that if we did have stock then  then we would erm  sell it.
So I mean that that's two ways of looking at it.
Certainly if  we've got some stuff in a box
Well I mean we needn't buy the expensive things like sweatshirts
Shall I try at erm Cambridge?
I mean it's October.
"Yeah but they, will they, they won't sell you on at a discount will they?"
Cos if we all
"But I mean I I just know that that Harlow tried stock keeping and selling, they gave up."
I know that er in Hertford they were quite desperate.
All came up with the same idea and they wanted to do it.
And in the end they came to Barbara's conclusions  so that its a an expensive thing.
"But I mean if we only had like the  writing paper and the envelopes and re-use labels, small items of stationery"
the stickers and I mean
they still do  yeah.
"But I mean I I expect, I mean even we had some left over e eventually you could sell them to our own members because they'd all want to use it"
Mm.
and it's cheaper than ordering it off the catalogue.
That's a good idea about Cambridge isn't it?
"You could borrow there stock, is that what you're thinking and then take back what we didn't sell."
That's what
I mean I've never talked to them so I I don't know yet
"Well if they would let us borrow it, that's a different matter to buying it from then because we then wouldn't make any money on it."
"Well I don't, I have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this  selling."
Well you you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more.
But then you have then you have the stuff that doesn't sell and deteriorates and you still have to have paid for it so
Er into the er into the bunker.
"In actual fact in later times erm, possibly when that er when this was no longer in use, erm they er put five, instead of two or three coal rails, on the bunker, erm they put five on at least a couple of the engines."
"To so it could accommodate more coal, erm and not have to return to base so frequently."
"Erm there's another picture, showing the er water er water crane, with a barrel."
Er and the erm and the hose and er and and lighting and so on.
And this was a little stage er for people to go and to erm transfer coal across.
"Now you can see on there, there's something at the back isn't there?"
Oh yes.
But I I don't know what it is.
I suspect it's er it's it's er it's some sort of little office at a guess.
But I would very very much like to er to find out er and get a picture of what is up there.
Or somebody could tell me.
Now that's a bit of a grotty picture put er it's useful to er er to give an idea of what was there.
"Now after the er there was a incident at erm the er engine shed, er the stabling of the locomotive was transferred away, erm and it used to travel at the end of the day over to the  er or , or  er engine shed, where it er stayed for the stayed for the night."
"Er and this is a picture of it and the  engine shed, with some ex-  locos."
Er which were normal at that time.
"Erm and er and basically that engine shed is where  's clothing factory is, erm just er at the side of  Road,."
And by the  Hill Bridge.
"A nineteen twenty four timetable, erm not many trains between  er and er and ."
"I say originally there were four, but by nineteen er thir nineteen twenty nine, erm basically the passenger service had ceased, although er we did get  there were minor special and so on, that that were run and race days, the stations and the er were used, but basically erm er the er the line beyond er  was er virtually entirely erm colliery er and and goods traffic."
But I say it it it became er quite increasingly important right up to its closure er of of er particularly for for catering for Bl for erm  pit.
"Er and indeed er a a triangle or a curve was put in near  to er bring to bring trains or enable trains to er er to turn round or go round and face Nottingham or come from Nottingham from  yard, and so on."
there's quite a quite a good service as you can see er between erm at least er  junction and .
virtually everything.
And that was maintained right through to the end.
"Erm a late picture, say on or about the day befor when it packed up which was erm July nineteen fifty nine for passenger servicing."
"And that was a sad day, erm and I've got the details, I think it was nineteen eighty one, er that it was finally bulldozed."
"And I think a lot of that er of the hard core and er went, and was buried near the rifle range, up erm at  's place."
Er just off  Road.
I think I'm right in that.
You can see that erm   good job of the knocking all the er stonework down and so on.
Rather sad .
over to you Mike
"Er, hello there, my name's Mike, well let's go over to the weather with Winsy, no Winsy, oh Rita's dropped dead, she's jumped off a cliff we think, we think"
and now we'll go over to Winsy.
"Hello my name's Winsy  insy spider climb up the spout, down came the rain and washed Winsy out, when the sun came out it dried up the rain, insy, winsy spider climbed up again  thank you, oh thank you, oh thank you, I know, thank you, well, today, at midday today it's going to be tipping down with rain and winsy, winsy, winsy, spider will fall down the rain,"
Melissa
"Er, oh, right, on toni , tonight we're gonna have sun and maybe a bit of snow and tomorrow morning we're gonna have a full moon"
oh you're
but he was quite
well
alright then
"Do you mind, I'm trying to do a programme here, and how the hell can I do it, with your gob slapping?"
Thank you
Oh you dickhead
"Oy, right then today, we have got Melanie of Neighbours here with us"
oh my god
"other day and I told this lady and she goes, who the hell are you?"
Who the hell are you?
"Well I said what you looking at you skinny thing, and she just, how dare you speak to me like that, and I just who the hell you looking at you ugly thing , I'm going to Espania tomorrow, cos I'm going holiday to El Spania,right then"
what you doing you sexy woman?
Thank you
"your wife is over there, don't you talked to her like that"
who the hell you think you are  I've got a good mind to put your beard right in this food
and he said
"came up to me  and he did, do you want a game of footy, I said oh"
"sorry about that love, well I'll go"
"and I tore this paper and I said if you're gonna have a wee wee then do it wee on me, so I said, up your"
all over the place and then I went out
"oh stink bomb, oh, come over here, who want a football, ah, want a game of footy, alright then"
er man in the goal man
oh look like that
"he's a football player as well, not him, not"
"are you doing, making it"
"Well after the break, you can buy them, this is one of them, for as little as twenty five pounds, Elton John's been wearing something altogether more expensive at the High Court this week but  does it  look much better?"
Will you see the join when you join us?
"And men in wigs, next."
for a while I was in the Air Force and then  I lived in various parts of the country.
"But coming back to live in   like to call it, er in nineteen seventy five."
"And I know perfectly well that there's no way that er I could get my wife to move out of the town, she loves it."
And so so indeed do I.
"Anyhow, er this evening  very happy to provide a few pictures for you to have a look at, and hopefully with a bit of information."
"If there's anything you want to er er to ask me about, please don't hesitate to er to butt in at any time."
Erm can you all reasonably see what er what's going on?
Right this is er merely a map erm where we're dealing with  er local people.
It's er it's not so necessary probably er as where at times I've given talks in various parts of the country on on this area.
"Er but erm this gives an idea of the railway lines that er well basically were in this area, erm I suppose er still round about nineteen fifty sixty time."
Some of them had er already gone.
But that's that's er basically what was was around.
"And of course er the Nottingham, Lincoln y Lincoln line here."
The er main East Coast Main Line over here.
"The er mass of lines in the Nottingham area, and so on."
"And that is a real subject in itself, and I think you've probably had John  talking to you."
Have you not?
Er John's erm quite a whiz on that one.
"Erm anyhow, this evening, I'm proposing to just merely cover this particular area, particularly."
Erm and then just coming along here and er as far as  and and just coming back to there.
Erm let's have a look and see what we can we've got.
"Erm well as many of you know the first one of the first things that you see, if you're c approaching the town from from the A six one two, from er ."
"Or from , er is that building, which is the old  crossing keeper's house or cottage."
"Erm it has been altered somewhat since the original er railway days, but nevertheless it retains quite a bit of the old character erm and er the high pitched roofs erm and the ."
"Interestingly, of different styles on that."
"It's not such an attractive house as the station master's house, but nevertheless er it is one of only two railway buildings now left er in this town."
"And of course as many of you will know, the railway line er used to run just in front, here."
"There's another picture of it, as one er goes past on the road."
Yeah  the role
but he but it is the day to day d detailed development
of a project to meet the cost specification and timescale defined in the client's remit.
Undertake the requirements of the project quality plan.
"Undertaking all design construction, installation to meet all necessary current standards, statutory requirements,a and the civil engineering design manual er safety manual."
In a broad sense.
Mhm.
Which seems alright.
Yeah.
"L let us then debate, I mean you actually have a load of projects which are maybe two or three thousand pounds apiece"
Mm.
where I presume you would just wanna hand that out to some guy and say get on with it.
And that guy may be an M S one.
"The problem is a lot of those are not being managed properly by the M S ones, M S twos."
Right.
We will
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's debate that then when we get together.
Thanks for raising it Jim.
Fair point.
Have you read what
"It's, it's important that we nail it down very very quickly because the clients' reports depend very much upon the input of the project engineer."
Project engineer.
"The only, the, there is only the project engineer can get into the databases to put anything in, or, or their clerical support, to get anything into the general notes about that particular"
Yeah.
project.
I think we're meeting early next week isn
Yeah.
Tuesday isn't it?
Tuesday
So we'll bottom that Tuesday.
I mean
Okay.
let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and  supporters and what have you!
Okay.
"Any others  that, yes?"
"I don't think animals should be ta , used to be tested for cosmetics"
Mhm.
perfumes or  detergents
Mhm.
different things like that.
What about medical research?
"Well, there again, yes, with reservations  because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives, yes."
"Yes, and you get all the animals who are experimented on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying, oh well this this, this causes cancer in rats or  and you, imagine the amount, the huge amounts of  the sub , whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer, and there's no  knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats  causing cancer, will give cancer to humans!"
"I mean,i it's just absolutely ridiculous!"
I'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity
Aha.
"and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals, for cosmetics, toiletry, household product  purposes."
Hasn't that campaign been going for
"Oh many, many years!"
a long time?
Yes!
And we're making progress now.
How?
There are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time.
"Erm  for example, you can grow human skin in a, in a cell culture and use that as a, as a testing er, medium"
Mhm.
instead of a live animal.
"We can  it can use erm  a si similar substance for eye tests  erm, to test  to replace the Jeyes eye test"
Mhm.
which again has been used for a long time on animals.
These tests are very misleading.
"They don't protect bu su er, er the public, they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products."
I don't want  otherwise you finish up with five separate er management procedures .
But also  is it necessary.
Jim
So we can make
let's issue that.
Because
"You, David and I need to sort out what we need to do to implement it"
Yeah.
and we will then implement it.
For you.
We've also gotta recognize clearly Dennis that civils and M and E cannot be stereotyped they are very very different engineering .
I'm s not suggesting they could.
And some management procedures cannot work very well in M and E as they can in civils.
Not because
Mm.
"you know we don't want to  in, in, in the civils team or what have you."
Indeed it works very well.
But in some cases some procedures cannot be worked on M and E
Yeah.
engineering.
They've got totally different algorithms.
Well it is supposed to be talking about managing the system and not d not taking people's e professional expertise away from them.
I mean but if
Yes.
if we are gonna have
It is a problem.
"procedures which are, don't quite fit you, then I think what we ought to be looking for is a certain amount of common ground between your procedure and our procedure, so there is not something, you're doing something completely different to the way the rest of us are doing it."
No.
I totally agree with you.
It's gotta be married together.
Totally agree with you.
"cannot stereotype every function, under a management procedure."
The pace okay.
The speed at which we speak okay.
yeah
Power and pace and pitch and pause.
Yes okay.
let's just go back to the pace then.
How does the pace want to be compared with normal con one to one conversation perhaps?
slightly slower
"Slightly slower just so that the words come over a bit clearer yes, so so people can actually take in what you say okay."
"Now the pause, how about the pause?"
To get attention
You do don't you
it gives emphasis it attracts people's attention
sorry
Pregnant pause
Pregnant pau that's right a pregnant pause isn't it?
I mean
But it's perhaps one of the most difficult things when you start out doing presentations isn't it.
Because you get that silence in the room and mmm you want to fill it  so but you're right the use of the pause effective and particularly with a variation in pitch that gives that emphasis the two combined together can be very very effective.
Okay so the power the pace the pitch and the pause all to do with voice and slight variations on those compared with normal one to one conversation  Okay.
So that's about the voice itself now under paralinguistics also comes that the concept of words.
Words are are I mean what are words?
A simple thing to say but what are words?
Expression
Yes er but what do they express then
Sorry
Feelings
could express feelings yes.
Facts
thoughts
Facts feelings yes thoughts absolutely there there there a code aren't they?
"I mean if you speak three different languages you could use three different words to put the same sort of thought of a picture dog, chien, hound there's probably an Italian and a  and that but if you speak the languages then different words different codes if you like are for the same idea."
Ah well more or less much the same as it is today.
That's what we got the union for.
That's what we got the union for.
"That's what we got the union for, to make sure that these things did not happen."
Mhm.
That we wouldn't be stepped upon.
Were you involved in er any strikes or anything?
"Yes, I was involved in the nineteen twenty six strike."
And in nineteen twenty er strike  going at the present day there was what we called the soup kitchens.
And every local village where there was a mine had these soup kitchens.
I do not forget  the other unions which were going at that present time helped us out quite a bit.
Though we los we actually lost the strike through no fault of our own.
"There was just because there wasn't enough money within all unions, not forget that there wasn't such a thing as a T U C then, this was in at the infancy when the unions first started, there wasn't such as a T U C, Trades Unions Congress."
"These were er in, in its infancy then and er we had a soup kitchen and er we, we got soup once a day, when we got issued with it."
"Each family took over a, a ration card."
"And you got so many slices of bread, so many pots of soup."
"And this was all done in old wash houses, where they used to have the boilers."
Where we used to b boil the water.
"And the soup was made in these boilers, and they were issued with their soup then."
And that was all we got.
What was it erm started the strike in the first place?
Well they started the strike as muddled as  as some greens come up and the men as union thought that was not right.
"Not forgetting in that most of the mines then, at that particular time, were nearly all privately owned."
Mhm.
Were nearly all privately owned.
Were nearly all privately owned.
"Most, right across the length and breadth of Great Britain, were all privately owned."
"Which the present administration of central government are doing their best to, under the same hammer as  it was in those days, so  it's just, this is just a repeat performance of the those days and the government today."
Was what it erm finally brought about the end of the strike in twenty six?
Pardon?
What was it finally brought about the end of the strike in nineteen twenty six?
"Well it were just like I  like I  the unions weren't as, as er financially well off as they were er at the present day."
and they write the lecture for me
they write yeah
they write the lecture as it takes place
yeah
yes
good preparation
Well no there's actually there's a lot of preparation in that isn't there
Well what I do it on is planning
Oh yes
and er control of sub contractors then you get a mixed group from Tarmac er different companies and their conception of what planning is and conception of what controlling sub contractor is
yeah
is totally different so I did the first lecture with what my idea of  to find myself talking to a a contract housing guy whose biggest order was two thousand pounds
right
so I've have them produce the lecture and then we've gone on from like doing
yep
exactly the thing
right
pick out three things and we'll talk about them
"Mm, mm"
and that's how I use visual aids
so it can actually be a stimulus can't it?
so I then find myself doing nothing else but walking around so I go and ask
right
So it forces me
yes
out into the audience
Well that's what you hinted at yesterday as well didn't it?
I mean if if you're here even now you've got your notes down rather than in your hand and and you stand and read but you don't use that or you don't use that then there is that tendency isn't there to?
So the focus of attention switches from people looking at me
"yeah, to the visual aid yes"
to this to actually looking at what they're producing
"right, yes, and that's an important factor that that if you feel everybody's looking at you it is important"
"Well it's not much, I mean"
You would like to see more  on the tables
Well we have had more fish out  yeah  we have had more fish out
in the show
Pardon?
Where did we come in the show ?
Ninth
Ninth
Ninth
that wasn't too bad.
I shall put in the report must do better!
do better!
we do want more fish out.
any comment about  the s the sort of format of the table show  do we want to change them at all
"How, how did it work out on the champion of champions night with having the  the table show, the full table show that we cancelled when Danny  came  er how did it work er did it work out comfortably?"
Oh yeah
"Er I felt, I've been after Danny for nearly twelve months to come see  and not been able to get him on the night I want him  the only night he was able, was available was  I think it was one night when we had something else on  I can't remember what it was."
"Erm  I think it was an inter-club actually, oh the inter-club table show  was the only night he could manage and that was no good to us  so erm  we, we  the only way we could do it was to t bring him the night that there was a full table show  transfer the full table show to the champion of champions  judge that first  and put the winning fish into the champion of champions and I know, well it's gonna be  woof  you know  a rush and that will, oh well, never mind."
Least we knew we'd get some extra fish didn't we?
yeah it's good that they had a fairer chance of getting on to the tables
twenty minutes
"So erm I'm  you kn I don't propose to do that again because I wouldn't er  I wouldn't arrange a speaker if we had a full table show but  it's nice to know that it did work out because we were, I was forced into a corner a little bit  erm and I think it was worth it because we  as I say I've waited a long time for Danny and he was well worth  listening to, I can listen to Danny for hours because he  he just speaks  and, and tells you about his fish, I'm, I'm very  very fond of listening to Danny cos I think he gives a good talk."
"he has  he  the same problems that we've all had  you know erm  and yes he's, he's, he's very easy to listen to  despite the fact that he's a southerner."
But we'll forgive him that
"He comes from near Windsor, doesn't he, cos he said he has a mate has a fish shop in Windsor"
That's right
often go to Windsor
That's right.
We was looking at a video
"erm it's an old one  and it's called Fancy Fish  and we were sorting our videos out to list 'em   and then we'll make a list  and then we'd let you have and then if you want a video and that, you know what you got  and we were looking through this Fancy Fish  and it's erm I don't know if you remember it, it shows an open show  at Oxford"
"Oh yeah, I think so."
Yes I remember.
He never put me on a heavy job until at such times he thinks I was fit .
Well that's the way I was treated when I came home.
By the the  I served five year then and I left that and I went into corporation transport which was tramcars then.
"And I went then from a, a timber mill and they  there's various different jobs I've been in since then, you know?"
What was the conditions like in the building trade after the war?
"Well er you know at that time there  in the building trade there was er what they term a, an essential work order."
"Which you had, the government, the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours' payment f of wages, forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not."
So that was an essential work order was  by the government in power then.
"That m er the firms must guarantee forty four hours wages for the man, doesn't matter what"
"Was, was this erm  to protect the men or to make sure that erm"
It's er it's more or less a
retainer for the men.
Aha.
"A retainer so that they could have, that man couldn't go in another job"
.
Aye.
Presumably this was cos there was a big erm a big surge on to rebuild the
"Oh yes, yes there was"
country
"yes, yeah."
Mhm.
"The, the present, the present day er in Edinburgh, the present day buildings that I helped to build up are now in Pilton and in fact er out in Saint  I built, that was a er built a  fact I did all the rough ."
"Both in Pilton and in present day er Pilton Circus which is er er there's a lot of er controversy going over er m making them, privatizing them and so forth but I l I was er the building of these things and did all the er the  work for them."
"Is that erm quite a dangerous job working on the, on the building sites?"
"Well it depending what, what sort of job you're doing."
"All depending what sort of job your job, it could be dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing."
"I mean you couldn't put a stranger on  a job that you, you yourself ."
But once you were qualified for the job you couldn't put a stranger on you had to ta teach that stranger a job.
Before what he was to
"Erm where did you go after the, after the building, the building work?"
"After the building I left er the building work and became a tram conductor where I went through a course in the, down at Shrub Hall went through a conductor's course."
"After going through the conductor's course I then went to Leith depot, old Leith depot er of the, with the tramcars."
If not entirely mine.
So I I would like to ask the meeting whether erm  I suppose  technically for advice on this topic.
think we can get away with putting out another newsletter on the seventh of February with a ballot in it anyway for these two things even though we didn't
Yes.
I think so.
I I mean er I doubt whether we'll we'll have a full slate in February anyway so I mean they'll probably be the option for people to come in later and we'll probably end up co-opting people later and er I think we should
Yeah alright.
I'm pleased you think that because it gets me off the hook now.
I think that because I don't think people wait until the deadline to er respond anyway.
Helen?
Erm I think technically we're actually constitutional because it doesn't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline.
It just says that we have to make the the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot.
So  they can do it from they can work it out for  themselves actually .
briefing.
Ah so so it's alright.
"So everybody who got the newsletter when they read it should have thought, Aha best look up"
I'm sorry
my copy of the  constitution  that I filed away so neatly when I received that months ago.
I think perhaps an apology and erm and an  in er the next newsletter might be appropriate for.
Otherwise we'll  phoning us up and complaining .
You'll probably be ringing people up anyway trying to get them to understand.
Yes I agree entirely.
I don't think people are going to be disappointed if they miss out .
Great.
Otherwise I if it's appropriate I'll say it looks like a great newsletter.
Yeah.
Right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of February.
Which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means I'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry.
So I'm collecting things to go in it.
Er those things should include well something about the box erm next next day or whatever I can find .
Details of about where and when.
I've got a thing from Steve about erm planning permission or application for Sizewell C that I didn't have room for in this newsletter.
And she were living in the parks.
Get up here.
Yeah.
"They used to give 'em subsidies to help 'em pay the rent, they've stopped that, so they've either to gerra job, to help put supplement to pay in the, you know, their housing accommodation, or they've got to stop school."
"In summer holidays, er, the grant don't  they take that six weeks"
Off the grant.
"off the grant, so that actually they get six weeks money less, through the year, than they should do, where they're used to paying all through year"
"For twelve months, now they don't."
"Now, they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school."
No.
"So, you know, any girl that's not living at 'ome."
"She got to go out and work for that six weeks, to, to earn the money  feed the"
"And where can you get that bloody kind of money, only  corner."
"Yeah, but where can you get a job."
"Well, that's it."
Where can you job.
"Well, it's forcing the girls on to streets, ain't it."
Yeah.
corner.
"I mean, they're begging 'em you to ke they're begging you to keep 'em on at school, and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on."
"It's like other day,we were talking to this bloke like, and he were on about businesses, says you can't underst , oh he said something about finances,how difficult it is to get finance to start a business up  and er, he said, I know, he said you can't me, he said."
"You seen all these adverts about starting your own business, you know, governments like, you know, doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi , you know  hitting your head against a brick wall"
Yeah.
"The only way you can start a business, is by starting it without insurance"
"straight off your own back, and then, you know, after it's running, get insurance."
Yeah.
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that.
regulate.
I mean it's
"I mean, look at laddo round there what's been broke into."
"He's no insurance  no insurance whatsoever, 'cos he couldn't afford it."
I know.
Any good news in the papers Alastair?
Well Derek for a change there is.
"And here in the Sporting Life there's the man who rode Gay Trip to Mackeson victory one of his Mackeson victories, Terry Biddlecombe."
Large as life and smiling.
He's been in the wars a bit since his racing career.
"He was one of my childhood heroes, a marvellous jockey and a great chap."
"He's been on the sauce basically but he's kicked the habit and he says of kicking the drinking habit  I've had a lot of help and a lot of good counselling, in the end it's up to me."
I don't want to be complacent but since March I seem to be winning .
Well that's great news.
"And a lot of people have rallied round Terry Biddlecombe, very popular man, Injured Jockeys' Fund among others and he's back in the back in the swim fully employed and in action for Mackeson today at er Cheltenham."
Here in the Mail Peter Scudimore wearing his new hack's hat.
Pipe can still meet the gold standard.
There are a lot of people saying that Mike Martin Pipe is not the force he was etcetera but there's been a change of policy down at  and if anyone thinks that Pipe has lost his touch they're talking twaddle.
He'll be back and he might be back at working men's prices.
You pay your money and you take your choice on the Mackeson and here J A Magrar in the Telegraph  idea represents Mackeson value .
He has some very harsh words for the Japanese about their ban on Frankie Detory saying it's shortsighted and harsh in the extreme and we'll all say yes to that.
Er in the Star Brad's a star.
This is Josh Gifford exclusive another one of these trainers learning to be a journalist.
Time some journalists learned to be trainers I think.
He says
I'm convinced he's a mu this is Bradbury he's a much better stronger horse this season and really do think he can bring the beer money back to Sussex.
We will see.
"And here today's bandwagon rolling tip,Pershing po poised to fulfil his promise , that's Paul Johnson in the Racing Post, John de Moreville in the Express  Pershing to strike his target  and now here is something of which nobody can be proud  Gosforth Park South Africa ."
This is in the Sporting Life and it's also in the Racing Post and this is a cynical move by the bookies to pick your pocket.
There are five race meetings today.
There are more dog cards than you shake a stick at yet the bookies are peddling this tripe from South Africa through the morning.
"Now in the first race the ten fifty, number nine is called Jew Wanna Bet"
Now when you hear that mentioned in the betting shops go no and pull the plugs out of the television.
"We do not want to bet thank you very much on South African racing, we've got quite enough of our own without the bookies ."
I like South Africa.
Well you're barmy.
We've got quite enough of our own without you peddling the
The prisoners of war were used as miners in the
Oh yes
camps?
yes.
Oh yes.
"We were used as miners, yes."
How did the pay and the conditions and such like in the army compare with erm being in the mines?
"Er the, the money, the money that I  money difference wasn't great but the fact was er who you were thinking about er when you did come out."
"You had a lot of, a lot of qualifications which you could get in the army in those days that you didn't have when you were in civil life."
"For instance you could learn to be a, a motor driver, you could learned to be an electrician, you could learn to be an engineer, you could learn to be anything."
"And you  through these courses and you got a certificate when you come out which er some of the  said to us, a fully qualified member of a, so these advantages were open to us then you see?"
Mm.
"So this was the, the main incentive for joining the army then?"
Pardon?
Was that the main incentive for joining the army?
Knowing that you gain qualifications?
Well my that was my  incentive  the mines.
Yeah.
"But as I've already told you  just, it was very ironical that I should l go back down the hole in er Germany again ."
"Were the conditions worse in the, in the German mines?"
In the ?
"Oh no, I  the mine, the mines in Germany at that time were far advanced of what er Britain's mines were."
"Cos they had different methods of doing the, digging the coal out, than they h than they had in Britain."
And I believe .
"Although I've not been down a mine since then, er the German mines to my er estimation were far more advanced than what the British mines were."
Were you made to work hard harder being a prisoner of war?
No harder than we did in Britain.
"You could not, no, a miner once he's been a miner, cannot go down er a pit and say to anyone down a pit, and say to anyone down a pit, that he's not a miner."
Because he gives his  right away.
"The experience he has gained in the mines at  immediately a man g a man who has been in the mines goes down there again his er n er he gives himself away, because, just because of the experiences."
"I saw an incidence er down in the, the mine a, a miner himself can tell, by the creak of a tree just where the heavy, heavy weight's coming on the, on the, the roof."
And where there's likely to be a fall.
Oh.
"She used to say what Diane, I've never heard of a Diane, after they were married this"
.
"And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me."
"Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he can't really afford he's flying because you spend all his money, when I, when I've been backing him, saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and"
What did you say to dad?did you say that to dad didn't you say it  .
But I thought she was stirring it you see and so did Diane.
What did you tell .
I didn't believe her
"You didn't, you never ."
"But he said, I said it as a joke when she was asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to support and she takes all the money."
"But I said I am the money  I gave him his first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought his first three cars."
.
"I excused myself and went to bed I think  but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say somebody saying a joking sort of way."
"Yeah, good stirring ."
And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in .
"Does, does anybody know what he's doing,."
"Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in"
What machine?
some magic machine.
What machine?
Magic machine?
Yes.
What kind of machine?
"A machine he's designed, I don't know for what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask Vaughan ."
"It's not to, it's not to isolate gamma rays ."
"Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him."
"It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea that, men, men from Mars have ."
"Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody should go and get him some  some treatment, sanitation."
Yes.
"You can get cranks, you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I think they need checking on to make sure that they are  happy with the life they're leading  it bothers me a lot"
So where is he now?
Exactly.
And Oakes I do like your tie.
I'm glad you mentioned that cos it was given to me by the wife of the steeplechase handicap a very important man today cos for more than
She didn't whisper
and Melinda his wife runs Simply Delightful which is wh that's one of the things she has a shop
in Malton and that's something
Didn't whisper anything that's well in today in the Mackeson did she?
No.
What's on today?
It's a busy old day.
Well it's lacing there's racing all over the all over the country and except at Ayr in Scotland it's raining everywhere I'm sorry to say.
"Racing at Ayr up in Scotland where it is dry, Nottingham, Cheltenham where the Mackeson Gold Cup is, big card at Windsor with a lot of runners and finally the all-weather racing at Lingfield."
Well as John said wet and windy everywhere unless you go very far north but those people up at Ayr it's gonna be cold so you can't have everything.
Main meeting as we've said is Cheltenham let's have the news from there .
First race there twelve fifty the going at the moment is good but they have had a quarter of an inch of rain overnight so of course I suppose there's every chance it could go to good to soft by this afternoon.
"Two important non runners there in the twelve fifty, number seven Far Senior and in the two o'clock number thirteen the I wouldn't say old timer but Panto Prince anyway shame he's not going to get a run."
It is raining at the moment and it's gonna be wet and windy but quite mild for the rest of the day.
No hazards but there'll be a good crowd so get there in plenty of time.
"Actually there's a race at eleven thirty it's a running race between members of the Press and the jockeys, people like Peter Scudimore, Deckland Murphy, Ben Newton for the press he could be the dark horse."
It's over hurdles as well that could be good for a laugh especially if er you don't clear them as well as you should do.
Erm
Scu's Scu's for the press.
Scu's running for the press.
Scu's yeah
Yeah
Yeah is that a help or a hindrance ?
I don't  anyway this is just one of the highlights of what has been two marvellous days at the Mackeson meeting sponsored of course by Whitbread and the big race today is the fifty thousand pound Mackeson Gold Cup confirming fifteen runners over two and a half miles.
Panto Prince is out and General Pershing is now new  favourite and clear favourite.
"Neil Doughty eleven to two, Bradbury Star that has to be the favourite easing slightly this seven to one with General Idea."
Just looking at those prices on the screen I suppose Oakes General Pershing is a worthy favourite or is he?
Well it's a very very competitive race I I I suppose he may have the best chance but there are an awful lot with good chances.
I think he's got a great chance.
And they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old  hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem.
It was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches in case er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes  they were pipe smokers.
Old clay pipes with black twist.
But they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er vouch for that they would never.
But the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd.
Aye they were very odd.
Y you refer to them as mile stone inspectors.
Mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road.
Mm.
And there's a story about the late Duke of Portland when he was travelling up to to  estate where his lodge was.
There was many's a tramp that would have taken the A nine then but this one in particular and he was very very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him.
And when that poor tramp perished out on the roadside one severe winter or spring time the Duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little mound and a stone put on it.
That was the er Lord of Caithness I think Tommy that the stone was.
Yes yes that I'm referring to yes.
The Lord of Caithness.
I cos I can't picture another stone you know on any other roadsides and I've been on plenty that and I travel and no and I can never know of another st stone that was put up to a tramp.
Anywhere in the north as far as I know.
But that one was and I heard a year ago but I never saw it till the bus driver I went with some years ago up to John O'Groats.
Mm.
And going up to to John O'Groats and right into past Castle May where the Queen Mother has and into the church where sh where the royalty goes when they're living up in up in Castle May At er well er Johnnie Groat is buried there too.
There's many a person Johnnie Groat to my name.
From these young days that you spent in Tormore can you recall how the tramps actually looked?
Oh they they
How would you describe them?
Erm the tramps?
Well fearsome looking
wild looking as you would say it now.
But but the very opposite to what people would er er th think of them as regards people now.
And that's ordinary people.
But but they looked wild because they would have long hair beards a  and and all oh my word they were wild looking but er.
And probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know.
And jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff.
"I I mean I You know, you never make these er  you can get every sort of evasive answer to these questions."
"And they're all lies, you know, they may sound nice and they may deceive people, but the truth is, any politician that I know and respect, when it comes to the crunch, if they think they have a chance of preferment and obviously ultimate preferment, take it."
"Some of them do it sheepishly, and with reluctance and say, It's never what I ever had in mind."
But they always do it.
Others are honest about it.
"Ken Clarke, I like him, I trust him, I admire him."
"What does he say, he answers the question straight, just the way I always answered it."
"Which is to say, yes, given another chance, I'd have a go for it."
"No I no I don't say that, cos what I always said is you cannot do what your friends will never let you do."
That's the real test.
"You cannot If you're in the the House of Commons and there's a vacancy or something of this sort for a job, I mean we don't need to invent a hypothetical situation."
"Your friends are the ones who say, Well you're the guy who could do this."
"And if they don't say that, or if they positively say, You're not the guy, you're wasting your time."
The only reason that you can make progress in that sort of situation is if there's a body of opinion that says that you should.
"But somebody like you could always find friends to say, Yes you ought to do that"
No I don't agree with that.
I d I do not agree with that at all.
"I mean, there could I mean I think the House of Commons is now some way past in in my life in the sense I haven't been there since er June."
"I've no idea about the mood, I've no idea what people will think of er maybe large numbers Well one journalist said to me in Blackpool and perhaps this says it all, he said, Michael, you're the only really popular person here this week."
You see they've nothing to be frightened of any more.
But they're wrong.
Ah but they
"Aren't they because you're saying, I'm still around"
No they may not be wr I I mean the the fact I'm around doesn't mean to say that I'm frightening.
And I haven't changed.
I've never been frightening.
People have misjudged me.
So you're not going to write your memoirs?
"You know, I I I'm I'm unhappy about this memoir business."
"I mean, they're self serving aren't they."
And they're all to to put the person's point of view.
"And erm I I I find it I mean I'm not going to be sort of holier than thou about it all I mean, perhaps I myself might be tempted er one day."
I think that's where Dr  lives now isn't it.
"In the nineteen sixties an awful lot of er of stuff went, er or was just allowed to er to get into bad repair, and of course er B R weren't terribly interested so they just abandoned it."
"You can see again this er this decorative work on there, and again  most attractive er chimneys."
The er gents toilet.
A bit spartan but there it is.
And er the ladies one  look er there we are again.
"Going round the other side, where the sun was shining that way better."
Very attractive for modelling purposes this.
Looking close close up.
There you can see the sort of leaded light windows.
And the basically the whitish colour of the er the brick work.
"The doors to the waiting room etcetera, or to the booking office."
Inside.
Used to be panelled there I think.
But er rather dirty yellow buff interior.
"And again that's looking at the same time in nineteen seventy se seventy seven, seventy eight time, it's looking back into that er er driveway, and if you can remember the sort of the Victorian or Edwardian er photograph that er I showed you before, of er virtually that er that view."
Going back to seeing to to looking at the erm goods shed.
There you can see the main entrance.
"And that's where you went down slightly, er or erm carts, lorries, anything else went down there."
Erm normally there was a er  horse and cart here.
Er certainly until the I think probably until the end of the war.
"Erm I believe there ha there was a comma or a Yeah, I think there was a comma vehicle that was used, er later on."
It may have come from York I don't know.
"Er I suppose that's where they er did a lot of the office work, a wooden shed built on to it."
"You can see the buttresses, and again the rather attractive brickwork that even even on a goods shed, a functional goods shed."
"Now that's the entrance and there is where the er there used to be the erm er  wagon turntable out here, and the entrance for the trucks was er through that doorway."
"I won't say through the door,looks as if it has been."
But er there.
I'm afraid the er er the end loading ramp and a lot of the other stuff had gone by then.
Interior.
"There you can see the er wooden staging, and this is where the wagons were brought in, er and were unloaded onto this wooden staging, and the delivery vehicles would come down this er sort of rampway, erm between er well either side,the staging either side."
And you can just see some of the er you can just see the timberwork on the in the roofing.
Yes.
"But Hughie is saying as far the works office is concerned, he wants to regularize the system with this procedure."
And as I understood you
Yeah.
"again, you wanted the, the, to regularize the system with within the B E S office."
"We well I do, unless that doesn't make sense."
"Now I can't see why it doesn't make sense, but if Jim came to me and said, look Hugh, that's bloody silly."
"I mean our objective is to give the, the client a good efficient cost-effective service, that doesn't meet those"
objectives.
"But D Dave, Dave, Dave could not handle, in B E S, what he handles on the civil side."
In what respect?
H he is not staffed up to do what
could quite easily ask you to do all the erm
Running around
"the actual measure the site measurements, but the agreeing, the valuations, and the processing of the invoices, he does himself."
And that is w well within what this procedure says.
I mean he does the invoices now doesn't he?
Well I understood so.
"Or the, the certification to the client."
Yes he does he does the certificate.
Yeah.
"So really all it, all the, this would"
involve them
"doing would be to say, would you project engineers er or, or engineers collect the in information on site, provide it to the quantity surveyors so they can check it against the spirit of the contract, and make sure that er what's proposed to be certified they're happy with."
Well it doesn't say that though.
Yes.
It
Sorry.
It's
Let's
"What I'm, what I'm saying is if, if you want to really stir people up, bring in a procedure within telling them what you're doing, and then imple implement it at a later date and people will say, this is not quality."
Hey Jim
The erm type thing means what means little codes mean or does that give us any indication as to what these sites are?
No there isn't a key unfortunately.
Oh.
I'll tell you now if the poster says Labour isn't working I'm not having it.
Yeah what which is the nearest one to a Conservative Club?
Cos there's a Conservative Club down in Fishergate isn't there
They actually own the one on the side of the Conservative building I thought.
Or they thought they did until it always says Conservative propaganda  on the sides so I think that's a gonna .
It's it's on a little table at the end which says rate card analysis and it had T V areas Yorkshire T V North East T V and then principle main secondary local corner shop other and totals   numbers in the middle .
Anybody got any suggestions on that ?
Will we pay the cost of the poster site?
Is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster?
I think so.
Well I think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site.
Whether or not the Green Party then supplies the posters I wouldn't like to say.
Right so it's not just that the National Party want the people on the ground to choose the nice addresses.
Well that's the
I think it's clear that the money's coming from from the local parties.
What they're ac what they're trying to do is coordinate enough local parties with the same poster that they can make a block booking I would have thought.
This might be a good way of raising funds by asking people particularly for the Euros I think.
"Why don't you sponsor you know, members who don't normally come to meetings, to sponsor erm a site for"
Yeah.
I think a lot of people would be willing to do that.
"Erm make a big splash in the newsletter, Please sponsor your your Green Party poster for the elections."
Doing this this is one erm campaign that  as a small proportion of the poster sites is it?
It looks that way yeah.
There must be lots of other .
I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the  they were working
Right.
Okay are you willing to go away and
Yeah I think I need to talk to Miriam again don't I.
Unfortunately I don't have a phone number I only have an address.
"And, did continue to get professional help after that, but I think she was actually one of the  factors that  sent me further down, by telling me I looked well!"
What age were you then?
Twenty.
Yeah.
"And can you identify why yo wa was, are yo are you now over it?"
Are you
"Yeah I would class myself as a recovered  anorexic, but as recovered as I'll ever be!"
I don't think I'll ever totally get over it.
I've still got a very distorted body image that I have to live with.
I think I'm fat!
"The reality of anorexia for you was what, just not eating at all?"
"Cutting down on food, I was University missing whole meals, telling people I was training, I'm a P E teacher so sport and the perfect body was very much up front, so the more weight I lost the better I was told I looked until it became totally out of control and I was eating an apple and black coffee a day and then vomiting so that I had nothing in me."
Erm  my metabolism was  out the window.
"Now, as a P E teacher you're working what, boys and girls?"
Yes.
"Do you see ah,th the pe , the boys and girls or the, the young people that you're working with  erm, having the same  veering towards the same kind of thing, I mean, do you see pressures on  on girls, towards achieving that perfect body in the way that you felt it yourself at one time."
I see boys calling the girls fat and it makes my hair stand on end!
Erm  it goes on continually and these poor girls are  oh you're fat!
You've got a great big bottom!
"And they're not, they don't have, they're normal."
I wonder what you think of what you're hearing?
Yes?
I just wondered how much actual help professionals are?
"I mean, is is there really  enough help given?"
"I mean, we talk about eating disorders"
Yeah.
but do they really actually dig into the  the real reasons for the eating disorders or they just try and get you back onto a stable diet?
Yes?
I think what put me off in th and certainly em embedded was some of the comments as around control of our lives.
Mhm.
"And maybe hope that we as, as people as women need to do is regain control of our lives so they, they belong to us, so it doesn't matter if if  boys say we've got fat bottoms or not,yo you say my bottom's alright an and you live with that."
"I'd be interested to know the lady who mentioned that, er she got help from friends, what sort of help did she get from her friends?"
It's just a case of it's just a case of a few individuals or people with rank who think they've go so much power they're gonna press people
Yes I'm sorry to hear that people in rank in your particular case were involved
"Yeah well we've got a job to do if you're a soldier you've got a job to do okay, you've got a bit of training, you've got a job to do"
Right absolutely
"yeah you don't need no distractions, and bullying and bullying"
"I quite agree, I quite agree"
"and racism and all that,distractions"
I quite agree
and if you're gonna send people to Northern Ireland and places like that you want 'em to defend the next soldier?
Well c could I just come in?
But they do.
David Lightbown yes David Lightbown .
Andrew I'll let you back in.
"in a minute,in a minute."
"I I certainly didn't go in in in in with a rank on my shoulder, I went in as a recruit."
But you said
But when I when I when I trained as recruit I trained with a lot of other er lot of other people .
"But that was in different days, this is nineteen ni"
There was no easy way out in my day you w yo y
"One second Andrew, I'll come to you in a sec"
you were fetched in and you did your National Service.
Now when you did
this National Service you served your country for a set period of time.
I actually did three years of that that period of time in in in the Army.
"The majority of people that went through that service all had some recollection of things they didn't enjoy very much but they by and large thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the Army, it livened them up, it made them better men and we have got after all one of the best armies if not the best army in the world, it's got to come from"
I don't think that's
somewhere and it has to come from the training.
Alright Andrew briefly briefly.
Go on.
"Basically I don't disagree with you, aye we have got the best army and I loved my I loved my time in the Army but I'm totally against the way I was treated in the Army."
That doesn't there's  when you're off duty it's great but when you're on duty it's different.
the Army's made me a lot better person.
And it might also be that
"the landlords in Saigon are if you like more commercial, more capitalist, it might be they were better organized than landlords in the north."
"I mean th th th the clan links in the south were much stronger than they were in the north, and therefore there might be even greater commercial landlord opposition to land reform than there had been in the north."
Was the south not more erm densely populated as well?
Yes.
Yeah.
So you'd end up putting  much smaller sort of bits of land
Yes.
for each peasant which is going to harm production too.
So there's gonna be less
"There's, there's less"
inequality or
"there's a greater pressure of population  therefore  are you saying that, that  land reform might  at least on the model tried in the north, might not yield any economic benefits"
Mm.
"in terms that, that th th the erm land to  released would be relatively small?"
Yes.
Right.
So the economic gains from  land reform in the south  might not be that great.
"I mean you, the, the more you argue the south is a viable economic system, the less there is to gain from land reform."
erm
and stuff like that
"I mean the amount of land each family will get   if you redistribute land, then the land for the family is not gonna be able to support the family."
Right.
But
Yeah.
Yes
Mm.
Yes.
"Erm  I, I think I might have missed Adam's point and I was going back to  whether the south was more efficient than the north because just tying it in with the seminar we had on managerial farms, weren't there more in the north than in the south?"
"And so then that would just prove that how, managerial farms weren't that much more efficient?"
Er I think those are separate issues.
"You, you, you're right to say that on the whole  there, the managerial farms were in, in the north, although there w there was clearly some in the south"
"Well, it says on the bottom of the, your copy of the charge sheet, production of driving license  you must produce it, failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended  and it also means you've committed yet another offence  by not having  a driving licence here to produce Mr !"
"Well I wa I wasn't sure  whether to, whether it would go through in time for the case  and that's why I haven't"
What's stopping you?
send off for it.
I wasn't sure what the situation was .
"Unless  the prosecutor is in the fortunate position of having  a computer printout of your driving  er le , holding your licence record  the case won't be able to proceed today anyway."
"And your worship, regrettably there is no printout of the driving licence."
Well the case can't go ahead today without  your driving licence.
Sorry?
The case cannot go ahead without your driving licence.
How many weeks do you want to ?
"Your worship, I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout  for the computer to be able to"
And this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer printout will  can be obtained.
Does that mean I don't have to apply for another licence?
"No, but er ee i , I suggest you don't apply for the licence now."
"No, you've left it too late!"
But er  I would urge you to try to find your driving licence  because
"No, I I I don't think I'll be able to because ."
"Right, well  you know you're going to be disqualified eventually for this offence if you're convicted."
Yes.
"What, the offence  the  drink driving offence?"
Yes.
Yeah.
Do you understand?
I realise that.
"You've pleaded guilty to the charge anyhow, it's a fair cop!"
The point is that when you are disqualified you're  not just disqualified from driving you are disqualified from holding or obtaining any driving licence.
So if you've got one at home  you're committing an offence  by being in possession of it.
Do you understand?
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
Right.
No Lochassynt Lodge.
That's right
Lochassynt
that's right.
And my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also.
Fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy?
Well
Or stories about the the people that were there or
Well
passers by?
ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp.
Aha.
The gentleman of the road.
My word and me just as a little boy of eight years.
I was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment.
And well did the gentry know that too.
You mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers.
Well yeah ministers er.
When I think of it nowadays and I see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well.
When you heard there was a minister coming I was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming.
And even that seemed a  but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way.
My word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road.
And there was no fright to be taken from him.
Is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ?
Oh yes.
Made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on.
She was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going.
And my word they enjoyed it well.
They wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even.
They would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock.
No they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father.
They would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came.
whereas animals don't!
They have no
Mhm.
"choice, they have no say."
Mhm.
"There, yes?"
How do you know that erm  animals don't reason?
"Like, how do you know what goes on, like with, dolphins, with whales, with all sorts of species of animals, like we don't know, well we're so dense we can only see things like this!"
"We don't know what goes on there, we've got no right to interfere with their lives!"
Yes?
"I think, I think we're overlooking one erm"
Mhm.
"great power that the individual has, instead of being ing , indignant  about erm, our views on animals in research, we could quite simply exercise our power, not to buy the products, to ask questions of our"
Mm mm.
of our doctors what kind of drug it is?
What research goes behind it?
"Do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no , on the basis of our own conscience, individually to make a decision, and we can all do that!"
We can buy a different type of product.
And there are many
Mhm.
"companies now  erm which quite obviously assert that fact, on the doorways of chemists for instance, they do not test on animals."
So you're saying the consumer pressure could could change things?
Mhm.
It it it's every effective measure
Mm.
"of stopping erm, a certain product  it simply will go out of production."
"I would disagree that er, humans aren't used in experiments because I think that we're all being used at various"
"points in our lives, for experiments, medical or otherwise."
Mhm.
"And erm  a , a lot of the medicines that are passed  er have been passed to a certain degree and then th th the  we become the the animal."
"Are you speaking as a, as an experienced guinea pig yourself?"
Well I'm a diabetic  erm
And just take note of that.
And that's what it looked like in nineteen seventy seven.
"Er one had the gateway, cobbled stone, approach to the railway station."
"Terrible shame in my opinion that that building was demolished, allowed to go to wrack and ruin, er and then then demolished."
"There you have the  er individual walkway th along there, and the entrance along here er up the yard."
The old  sort of double  erm er  goods shed.
"Er and er vehicles would go down, it drops down inside there, and there's planking er at obviously, level erm on either side er of this arch er this erm er wide way er through to the bottom."
And I'll show you a bit more in a little while.
"There is another picture, taken on a different day, showing, again in about nineteen seventy eight."
"Seventy seven seventy eight, the remains of quite a substantial goods shed, for a relatively small place."
"Now I daresay most of you know that, really the population of  or , was pretty static in the er well from eighteen fifty to about nineteen fifty, or even nineteen sixty."
Erm round about three and a quarter thousand.
Very little change.
"They had er seventeen or nineteen pubs, I can never quite remember."
Er for that population.
"Er and er of course a number were closed in the er early part of this century, and more er coming along."
"We've still got about ten or eleven I think, haven't we?"
"Erm really the railway was closed in nineteen fifty nine, for passenger traffic."
Just about the time that Dougie  started er building substantially in the town and doubled to population to its present six and a half thousand or so.
"Er whether or not it would have survived, I I wouldn't know."
"Anyhow that as I say, was the er goods shed."
Er that erm was in use er as I say until the closure.
"Now there's a picture of the station, and you can see that we've got the post, the cobbled entrance, on this on the left hand side was the station master's house, the garden."
You'll notice that the the erm fencing is vertical.
"Erm and that was normal practice until the early part of the century, about nineteen O seven I think it was that the  started using the er forty five degree angles, style."
"But er er vegetable garden, and the lot."
There's over here there's er a passenger station.
Four wheeled coaches er in here.
"Some goods er wagons on that side, erm lovely ladies in the long dresses and so on."
Er on this right hand side you've got erm various advertisements for er Belfast and Northern Ireland and er and sort of er away days and and so on.
Erm various signals.
"The main er sort of booking place, er waiting rooms and so on."
Then we'll probably put this case back till later in the day.
Do you see that Mr ?
Because you're not represented
Well I don't know what the situation is!
"Well I'm te , that's what I'm trying to tell you!"
You'll have to .
But because you're not represented the statements will have to be read out!
Which will er  take quite some time and er will
and certainly will if you're reading to the court which was something you were concerned about.
I'm not   .
I don't know whether you can help that man with that.
"Because Mr  has represented him, Mr  said before that he he thought it was as duty solicitor  that he, he has represented him at some stage as duty solicitor  but, he is represented under legal aid though this defendant  by a firm of solicitors in Birmingham  and he's anxious to be committed for trial  today."
"If he was represented we could do it er, on the section six two."
Otherwise
Are there any solicitors present today?
"Not at present, but he doesn't know ."
Oh I see.
He's given certain information to the court which  isn't correct anyway!
Have a word with him.
It might help everybody concerned if you could have a word with .
Yes.
We'll have a word with .
Could you deal with cases fifty five and fifty six your worship?
"Shaun David , Mr  represents him."
Are you Shaun David ?
Yes.
What's your date of birth Mr ?
Twenty fourth of the seventh sixty seven.
What is your address  Mr ?
.
"Well you're charged with two offenses, the first of which is that at Clitheroe  on the twenty sixth of August nineteen eighty eight without lawful excuse  you damaged two stained glass windows  a picture frame glass and twelve  glasses of varying descriptions  belonging to Whitbread Breweries  intending to damage that property and the being reckless as to whether that property would be damaged  contrary to section one of the criminal damage act in nineteen seventy one."
"I understand this value, value has been mentioned on a previous occasion, I think three hundred and ninety five pounds?"
"What I also want you to do on this is if you can refer to Adrian Bull's book, the Economics of Travel and Tourism, and just go through the relevant chapter on demand."
"It's the Wensley Gate,Group."
"The tape recorder is now running, I hope that it's going to be recording, but let us not erm, be inhibited as a result of that."
"Erm, programmes, erm, haven't got a programme."
No.
"Erm, I haven't got a programme."
Thank you.
"You haven't got a programme, the very last one."
"Wh what, how how very carefully calculated that was."
"Erm, we are today, going to do the Black Sheep of the Family, erm, because erm, erm, doesn't feel that he he's up to doing the one that he thought he would do this week."
That will be postponed probably for a fortnight.
"Can I remind you, erm, looking at that programme, that, erm, healthy eating now appears on, I think it's the, sixteenth of March, and sadly I shall be here on the sixteenth of March."
"I shall be in Leicester at any rate, and I may very well come and join you, to talk with you about healthy eating."
"I was hoping to miss that one, because you might be trying to persuade me that I should erm, partake rather more of healthier food, than of the unhealthy food that I do eat."
"Er, it is."
"Yes, it is it is a project study, and therefore it would be as well, if we were all thinking about it in advance."
It it is in tha the hand-book.
"Er, it's on page a hundred and thirteen."
"And the idea is that as we've done with previous erm, discussions, if each one could come along armed with some information to do with healthy eating, erm, there's a list on page a hundred and seventeen, that might start you off thinking."
"Erm, celery, low fat dairy products, incidents of heart disease for those who have an olive oil rich diet."
"I don't olive oil, that's the trouble."
No.
Formic acid can be helpful to pregnant women.
Well that certainly doesn't apply to me.
No.
No.
Twenty two heaped teaspoons full of sugar every day.
"Well, considering I have none, somebody's having an awful lot."
"Er, and eating will be always one of, and so on, there's a few items there, that you might like to concentrate on, and perhaps, as much as anything, if you have your minds open in the intervening number of weeks."
"If you see an article, a snippet, er, a comment, from a newspaper, from a magazine."
"Cut it out and bring it along, and I think it will all add to our discussion of healthy eating."
And what's the better deal?
Let's find out.
"And let's start with a basic question, here in this nation of animal lovers, do you think animals deserve a better deal?"
Some animals?
All animals?
Any animals?
Do they deserve a better deal?
"Button one for yes, and button two for no."
This is a descriptive vote because this hundred er  women are not a representative cross section of the whole of Scotland  they're invited to come from various places  and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal.
When you said yes to that which animals did you mean?
And what were you talking about?
Yes?
"I think, a lot of people  see the stray dogs problem as a big problem, certainly if people have decided to  partake of pets, they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets."
Okay so
And I think problems like that  are due to human irresponsibility!
So those animals do have a raw deal!
"Okay, that's one area."
"Who else said yes, and why?"
"Up, yes?"
"I think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal, for example, large wi wild animals that are used in circuses, we haven't got the right, as people, to say that they're here for our entertainment."
What would that better deal be in that case?
"The better deal would be, not being transported up and down the country, and not being made to perform tricks that are  un unnatural to their own  behaviour patterns."
Aha.
Aha.
Any other views?
Yes?
"I think that er  concern should also spread to animals that are hunted pleasure as well, i.e. the stags, deer, foxes, hares, I mean, there's there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment."
Mhm.
Now the better deal there presumably would involve
Not chasing them at all!
not hunting them at all?
No!
"from you than the statement you've just made er and I think you'll be you used the word abhorrent, I think you'll be abhorred by some of the er stories you're about to hear."
"If I can come to you Andrew , you were in the Royal Highland Fl Fusiliers, what"
That's correct.
happened to you?
"Basically  the full time I was in basic training and when I went to the Regimental the Royal Highl Fusiliers Regiment the first battalion, I was physically beaten and mentally tortured er into the same bargain."
Well what do you mean by mentally tortured?
"Well they can physically do it to you with use of fists, use of hands and whatever else they've got and they can mentally do it to you like put you in jail that  or all sorts of things like when I was on sick leave, they came and lifted me."
"Right well t t tell me about the physical abuse, what sort of things were they doing to you Andrew."
Beat ya up.
"N C Os, noncommissioned officers beat ya up, and a above them as well."
You get
So
"in a battle camp, you're supposed to be  learning how to fight in a war and basically they beat ya up, and in camp as well, it happens in camp too."
"And did did you see th w was it widespread, did you see it happening to other people?"
It's very widespread.
Actually I  witnessed a guy being raped in the Army.
"That was by that was by normal recruits but it still happens it, actually the the bullying goes down the line."
"The N C Os bully, the officers bully the N C Os, the N C Os bully the privates and the privates bully the privates."
"It goes down the line, all the way down the line."
It's a nons it's a non
"If you're bullied, you bully somebody else"
Aye.
and so on and so on?
"let me just get back that was abhorrent as a word w has already been used and er should be used again by what you said, you saw s somebody being raped by two soldiers."
Did you try and help that particular soldier?
"I did, I did, I s actually put a stop to it."
That's
So that was a brave thing to do?
"I wouldn't say it was brave it was a normal thing to do, wasn't brave, there was nothing brave about that."
Was just a normal thing to do
You'd expect yeah y you'd expect somebody to do that for you of course.
Of course I would.
Mm.
W what about  Street school?
"Street School, I was th there on only there a year, and the headmaster came in one day, he was another Liberal politician."
"Headmasters were always members of the council, in those days, and they were always tended to be La Liberal or Labour, which I the present Labour would say was very pale pink."
"And the headmaster at er  Street school, Joseph , was a Labour member of council, and Joseph  was tended to be more Liberal."
"He came in one day and asked what M C C stood for, and I've always known a lot of useless information, so I could tell him, so I was then dispatched everyday to the erm radio shop in the High Street, to get the cricket scores in Australia."
"And then he asked me, he said, Well, have you read that notice on the board about er scholarships?"
"I said, Yes, but there's no hope."
"He says, Well, your aunt was a teacher,co you could go teaching."
You're na you're not going down the pit?
"I said No, no-one at home was, Everyone at home had said, You're not going down the pit."
"And he entered me for the scholarship,, and er, I won."
Mm.
"I incurred his displeasure on one occasion, there was a young lady sat on the form in front, we had those, where you sat in pairs, on the iron sort of things."
"She had plaits, and I tied them together, on to th behind the bar, and he he caned me.."
Mm.
"I suppose caning was a a more frequent form of discipline, in those days?"
"Caning was, er yes, erm."
"If you asked for trouble, you got it."
"Would you ev would you ever get any comeback from you your father, if you got told told off at school ?"
"If you got in trouble at school, you got in trouble at home."
No if and buts..
"About going t about getting the Henr scholarship to , had only just opened then ,"
That
hadn't it?
It hadn't er I went when it opened.
"We were er before then there was the , the school just over the wall to  Street, was the  Centre."
"It was a pupil, teacher centre."
"It started life as a technical school, which it was given by subscription, mainly the colliery company, for scientific education."
But used during the day by the Education Committee as a pupil-teacher centre.
"And up till then, you went to you got your scholarship, you went to the tu pupil- teacher training centre and then you became a teacher."
"Erm if you  passed  , erm you did a stint and then you came to  College, Nottingham for your teaching ticket."
Yes.
Can you undertake that that will apply?
Yes.
And you aware of the restrictions on drink for young people?
Yeah.
And the sort of concern about that?
Yes.
And we're going  to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep the premises open  and I must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted   that the transfer is specialist.
"And we're ordering that the other person, if possible, attends at that ."
If she's not in the district then it'll be difficult.
"And if it is possible, if she is in the district we order that she attends the transfer sessions  the outgoing licensee."
Fifty eight.
Have you got the license er  Miss ?
No it's  .
"Well, but it will not be effective until er, you have produced that license to this court."
"Erm, I assume it  that this er, if the licensee has left those premises  wi she's physically left has she there?"
Yeah.
"Er, when did she go?"
About a month ago now  .
She left the company then did
Mm.
she?
"I see, well I would of expected those premises not to be selling intoxicating liquor sir, they've obviously not had a license for a month!"
That will also be er  considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing!
"You must produce that license otherwise it's not effective er, Miss !"
"See, as licensee you have responsibilities!"
"It's all very well the company telling you as employee what to do  it's yo , you're the one who's going to be in difficulties if you don't comply with the licensing laws!"
Your whole application's not been very satisfactory Miss !
And the fact that the license is not in  puts you in in in difficulty!
We are aware now that you're operating without a license and it's up to you to get that license here as quickly as possible!
Right  .
Okay.
I mean it depends on each organization doesn't it?
Sort of two way two way thing you agree or don't agree between yourselves.
I'm in some ways surprised the non-political groups want to affiliate with with the party.
War on Want are er for a long time have been the only probably the only erm  that put their neck on the block as far as social and environmental aspects of the party go.
But you know I agree with you cos that  as a charity.
Yeah they seem to have a lot more to loose than we do.
Yeah.
There's been a lot of trouble lately a lot of problems haven't they.
War on Want didn't they go bankrupt or something.
They did yeah.
There is a possibility that War on Want should  be considered as being relatively high on our list of people we would be willing to affiliate with.
That's something that  not bad at all they do  as well so.
So is this was the national War on Want who contact us or the local contact?
Erm it was a lady who came from Leek.
Oh.
Do we have any feedback from any other local parties or the National Party are they recommending it or they only putting out feelers to local parties and ask what what we feel about it?
No.
associated with for example you're  party.
Oh that's just a mailshot deal.
They quite likely the Green Party got a free mailshot and their communication returned or or even might have got some money from them you never know.
I thought this sort of thing would be something the Green Party nationally should decide that whether in principle we ought to affiliate with.
Yeah but the advice might not have gone amiss and
Yes  surprising that War on Want aren't asking the national party
Yeah.
and instead are mailshotting all the local parties.
I think it may be it may be that  they could perhaps get more money if the local parties affiliated separately but
What about our links formal or informal with other York  branches of other
Yeah I mean this is this is erm more the sort of thing that I I had in mind.
Yeah.
Erm I think I mean we ought to be doing more with the local Friends of the Earth and local Greenpeace I feel.
In the past Greenpeace have always rejected us and er on the grounds that in fact we're a political party.
And Friends of the Earth it's only relatively new it's only been going properly for what two years.
Yes.
"Erm, being with the S S P C A, I have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals, but one of the saddest photographs I saw, quite recently was  two monkeys, well they're primates, we are"
Yep.
"part of that family too, and they were in a lab awaiting experimentation and they were  in cages side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands, almost as though, to give each other comfort."
Mhm.
Monkeys feel pain.
"They feel happiness, sadness  and they also have a sense of humour."
Under the nineteen eighty six act
Mm.
"they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office, as well as locally."
"I mean, it's it's  vets etcetera"
Yeah.
Yep.
"are always present in research establishments to ensure  the well being of the animals, and very often there is actually no pain  involved in the research."
"How, how do you know that?"
Well I was told by somebody who's involved in animal
Right.
research!
Right.
"But er, frequently the animals are used  for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed humanly before the research actually takes place."
"But do we find it acceptable that animals should be used, however painless the event."
Well I would rather use an animal any time that my own child!
Up there.
"Er, Switzerland is one country that has banned the use of animals for research, and I think we ought to be going along these lines  that, if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for experimentation."
Mhm.
"And if we were to ban the the process,th erm  we would devise other means for research, would, we would find alternatives."
There.
"Th there'll, there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it."
It's quite
"alright, they move it out of Switzerland  but if we can't have it here we'll have it in Pakistan or somewhere  where they want the money!"
So it won't make any difference  in that
Yes?
That's all from Region.
"Er, I've also received minutes from the Epping Forest from Redbridge Group and they also have a lobbying workshop erm, that's on the second of March, and they're asking if anybody's interested in that."
Is that an evening?
It doesn't actually say
I think it's
"but, er, probably would be."
If you're interested could follow it up.
"They meet in, don't they meet in Leytonstone or was it Wanstead, somewhere in that area."
Wanstead
"Mm, mm."
"was, was, where they help Islington."
Monday mm.
Would you be interested in it?
"Well I might this, this, the time fitting in with the families, they're, they're likely to come back to"
"Okay, well I'll, I put some information not full details ."
Right.
"Erm, actually there wasn't a lot of detailed stuff, there was erm, materials for gr groups and winter sales"
Do you want to pass that over to Aida please?
"which we have a  erm, there's a bit about release policy and procedures for local groups, er, groups can help their prisoner with mummy or other erm relief, erm on the Christmas family particularly and it's, it's explaining you know how they do it and the best ways to go about it."
"Mm, cos there's a special fund available for that, that's particularly why they"
"anyway they explain all about it, if it would, if we need it."
"Er, there's a mandate workshop."
"Oh they, no, sorry,, they're offering still a mandate workshop for the group, erm, sending a trainer"
I'm the trainer.
"you're the trainer, oh well ."
"I've been very bad on this recently, I've really been too busy or tired, but I have got, I have, today I have had arrived oh not today, the last few days, the new mandate workshop, so"
So you've got to read through it and let .
"I was gonna say, having spent some months or years  well ."
"It's all the new bits in about it, yes mind you, there's always, always been a mandate, the mandate workshop was the very first one that's produced, but this is an updated version and changes ."
"Yeah, have there always been workshops , continue workshops on mandate or?"
"Yes, there's always been a mandate workshop?"
Or just when there  reviews?
What's the what's the primary method of of getting contact with the audience?
Well the method
Eyes
looking at them
"Yeah using the eyes, yeah, okay."
Both to to to feel to make them feel involved and to er gauge the reaction gauge how things are going so you can er get some feedback on how you're doing.
Okay
You need to keep their interest don't you?
"Oh absolutely, yes, I mean I mean"
the effect
Sure  erm no amount of audience contact will compensate for a boring subject.
"Yeah, oh yes I erm erm I'm not saying that and that's when we come on to the the design and the content that we put in."
"Yeah, you're absolutely right  very important point yeah no amount of eye contact is going to compensate for something that that doesn't hold their interest."
Okay.
What else then what other methods do we have besides having eye contact what else might we do to involve the audience to make them feel involved?
Questions
"Yes, absolutely so questions er a very definite way of involving the audience and again it gives a measure of feedback doesn't it because if you get the right answer you know that they are with you and you know they are understanding what you have to say."
"But obviously if there's some hesitation over it then perhaps you just need to step back a stage in what you're saying and er er go over it again to for clarity, and Tony what's another way of involving the audience?"
Well you've got to get them to participate but I suppose you would do if you question them
Well yes I guess you would.
Jeff what's another way that you might make the audience feel that they're involved?
Mike
Well yes okay that's a possibility and that's something that we'll come on to tomorrow.
"But in terms of audience contact, Sarah"
Jokes
Well yeah yeah a bit of humour a bit of humour
Smile at them
Smile at them well yeah okay.
"Bob, another way of involving the audience making them feel part of it"
Ask them to relate their experiences
Yes okay but that in a way comes under questions doesn't it yes.
Ask them
In this dictionary of phrase and fable.
"Brewer equates black sheep with bet noir, the eyesore in the flock, a disgrace, something unpleasing."
Sheep used to be of great importance to the British economy.
"Black sheep was often despised by shepherds, and their wool was less valuable."
"Nevertheless, even black sheep were used for export."
"Okay, that's that's the bit of erm, sheep background."
"The nursery rhyme then, comes from Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book from around seventeen forty-four, and the division of bags, one for the master, one for the dame, one for the little boy who where wherever he is, lives down the lane, is said to refer to the export tax on wool, which was imposed as far back as twelve seventy-five, making even the outsider sheep of value."
So black sheep are different.
"The term is used negatively, but the black sheep of the family maybe an attractive person, someone with a sparkle, with a courage to be different, with a courage to defy the norm."
"Everyone, is says, can think of black sheep of their acquaintance."
"Every can you think of a black sheep of your acquaintance, do you do you."
"No, I don't whether I can."
Not  acquaintance.
"Perhaps I've, perhaps I've, perhaps I've mixed in a very sheltered society."
"Perhaps family history, perhaps, but not the very"
"Yes, yes."
No.
"I don't think er, and of course, er, again perhaps the idea of a black sheep, has changed over the years."
"Erm, circumstances which made someone, perhaps fifty years ago, considered to be the black sheep of the family, wouldn't necessarily be the same now."
No.
Mm.
"Erm, spivs."
I I don't think I had anybody in my family who was a spiv.
"But there was somebody in in the street where I lived, who was a spiv, and he was considered to be the black sheep of the family, didn't quite fit in when everybody else did."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Nowadays, you know, erm, don't know whether that sort of thing"
"Enterprise, culture."
"En enterprise, culture, yes indeed."
"Yes, yes."
"Er, I mean in the olden days, they used, they they usually the  sent to the colonies or, sent into the army or or into religion, weren't they."
Mm.
"So it was pragmatic but it could also fit into their ideology in that how, that if they'd gone straight for socialism"
"Now come on, this, this is disgraceful."
There's no  this is a disgraceful
No but if they'd gone straight for
document for a communist party to base land reform on.
There's no ideology  at all.
"Absolutely, absolutely none."
I think it's only pragmatic in that  it's maintaining production levels.
Or helping production but
"So is this what, they certainly ?"
"Yeah, this is it."
This is
That's
"No, no"
No but I mean the basis of it was presumably landlord out and China was based around this
Yeah.
Well it was for the next  two years.
They didn't
"No, no."
Oh right.
"I mean this, these, these, these"
Well that's alright then.
"No, I mean we would, no"
So I mean this is just another basic erm
Yeah.
"Well in fact it, it it has in fact gone full circle because through the nineteen fifties you went through to co-ops to collectives to communes which lasted through to nineteen seventy eight, the communes were then disbanded and you're back, now, after reform which took very much system."
"But, you know, if, if, if I'd have put, when we, when we started to talk at the beginning of this term we had at the beginning a general discussion about what are we gonna put in land reform, if I'd have come along to s to you and I'd said well I think we should do this"
We'd of laughed.
Right.
"And I, I, I, I, I, I would not have endeavoured to persuade you that this was going to be  the land reform document that was, that  this is it."
It doesn't surprise me that they did it.
But this isn't this is it?
I think very often you do need professional help and it isn't possible to do it with family and friends because of the interaction that actually makes it worse.
"So there's a practical suggestion and I, I like, I like Carole's philosophical suggestion that we could start celebrating the diversity of human kind."
"I mean, that's the kind of thing one often hears on this programme, is it wishful thinking or d'you think we could actually achieve it?"
Oh!
Wahey!
Yes?
I think the media have an awful lot to answer for!
Yeah.
"I run one of the self-help groups that one of the ladies mentioned and we looked at an outsize catalogue recently and it went up to size twenty six and in some cases up to a size thirty  and the ladies who modelled the clothes were no bigger than a twelve, possibly a fourteen, but a very shapely fourteen!"
Mm.
Mm.
"So the media, even when anything you do depends on your size,yo your image is all for a woman, your brain or your ability really comes way down the line!"
You have to look good first  before anyone listens to your other abilities!
But looking big and good are not incompatible are they?
"I was just gonna say, I I think we should possibly stop blaming the media or whatever actually happens and perhaps echo what the  the lady earlier said, I think that it's in our hands, we're the women   that could make this happen !"
Yes?
Well I
I was just si Oh sorry!
I'm sorry!
One at a time!!
I was just sitting here wondering why men don't have this image problem?
Because there are an awful lot of overweight men and I don't see any problem with them at all!
They don't seem to have any problems between each other either!
I'm quite concerned that my four year old daughter is after a Sindy doll  and wondering whether perhaps Sindy dolls shouldn't be produced  in erm  such diverse figures as real life?
Well there's an
"Are we, are we providing"
an interesting idea!
our future generation with women with an ideological  figure such as Sindy.
A lot of ideas and certainly worth talking about it.
It's something I hope we'll talk about again.
I hope you've learnt something and I know that I have!
Thanks very much for joining us.
And all the estate men first of all would get everything.
And all the crofters then that was paying rent.
In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate?
Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths.
They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
The pools?
Yes the pools.
That's the salmon pools
Mm.
you see.
And they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men.
To cross the the
Yes just yes you see
the streams .
it still on the the rivers.
But now it's made of stonework or or concrete.
Mm.
Now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand
Mhm.
to the weather.
But er that's the way.
And the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge.
And the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that.
And painters and joiners they would have themselves.
All self-contained?
Yes self-contained yes.
There'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a
"Erm  what, what we do today is to  way go back over some of the ideas about land reform and then carry them through to the ninety fifty er Agrarian Reform Bill."
Erm   what we've been looking at is  the process of land reform.
"Tt  and we're obviously looking at a process of land reform which has, has undergone a number of changes and I think we, we've begun to see some of the influences on those changes and particularly over the, the last week or so the  this has ."
"Tt er  and i in a sense there's kind of been an upward trend in terms of progression through that, that reform but within that there have obviously been a number of  and in a sense what we've been coming to terms with is, is what has been causing those, those variations, those changes in that policy."
"They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that"
stacks of it
"and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to"
"Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see"
"Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a"
"for pupation, yeah"
"I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart"
Oh yes
used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it
yes
"must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it?"
"Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub"
"Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree"
this is going back
to get the figure into it
"I, a cut"
on the diagonal
Yes
"you see, a diagonal, the"
"raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,"
Yeah
but expensive that was
yeah that's right
"cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in"
Yeah
"this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced"
Yeah
"because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard"
"I wouldn't of thought so, it was"
I wouldn't of thought so
the
I'll have to find out of this
Yeah.
That's the difference.
"And between them both, you can, you could  I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage, mortgage, and you could end up paying what, twenty thousand, twenty four thousand  back."
Yeah.
"Well, finance company."
"You, you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to, and you get a certain amount put on that, and that's it, it's fixed."
No.
You don't pay no more.
"Say you'll, you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred, that, if you buy, if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures."
"You borrow twenty thousand, and the interest payments works out"
Benji
very high
He's alright.
"It's very high, you know, the interest payments are very high, but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say, just for a a figure, five hundred pound back for that twenty thousand, five you know,"
Yeah.
"five thousand pound, not."
Not paying it for years and years all the time.
"But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company, you're gonna, you're gonna borrow twice that, you gonna have to pay twice that much back."
"Forty grand, you kn that's the only difference, and"
"I don't mind that so much though, 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way."
"But I just got one thing that I want, that they gonna send me owt dodgy like a loan shark bloke or owt like that, I mean you, you're bound to be a bit nervous, you know."
"No, they won't send a loan shark."
"You you can tell loan sharks, straight away, because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent ."
"Ma maybe twenty nine, even thirty, depending, but if it er, mind you I don't know, because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em."
"But, you know, when you when you borrow money, you get er, an interest rate, don't you, over so many,yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gonna pay it back."
You know.
"If you say, oh, we'll take it over ten years."
"Well you've got ten years interest to pay, ain't ya."
"So you pay the interest for for nine years, and they start paying your loan off."
"We're still having trouble getting insurance, and er, anyway I phoned, and I wrote him again yesterday, and he's given this number, who er, who he's with."
"'Cos he had a right job,got plastic, 'cos he even  plastics, I mean that's"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I might do"
your handwriting's quite nice and neat
"Erm, oh I've got another piece back that I've  twenty nine, twenty nine  as it goes"
That's a C innit?
"Yeah, but that goes, that goes in the lit file, so I got rid of my er with the thirty five I managed to get rid of erm"
Who's got all these things?
They're at school in a box
Thank goodness for that
"but er, so now I've got a thirty six, thirty five, thirty four, thirty four, thirty four, thirty two and thirty, so that's a B count in B file, so there's no hassle with that, but if I can get on and get rid of the er, I've got twenty eight, twenty nine in there as well, er twenty eight in there as well, so I want to get rid of the twenty eight and twenty nine  but it is a guarantee that a B file, so there's"
Mm
"no real worry about it, but erm I want to do better"
What about your economics?
Or don't you know that yet?
"Yeah, he still keeps far faffing around with the erm  whatever detail, yeah, he still hasn't given it to us"
Well how you supposed to do it?
"Did you get, did you get that thing finished er geography whatever it was?"
"Something, something"
Science
well well whatever it was you
No
had to finish off?
No
Why not?
"Because I didn't have time, but er they started geography course work today and I was out the lesson"
Why were you out the lesson?
"The drama thing, so I'm a se a section hand already on that and I've even got a, well we're supposed to listen to it tomorrow, we've got a tutor period instead, so it means that we miss another lesson"
"Can't you copy out what you, what you missed?"
"Yeah, I'm out tomorrow night, I'm out school, selling books again  so should be at home"
When you gonna get all this work done Richard?
"Yes I'm trying to get it done, but I am getting pressure from the year group as well, it was, and so I've got that, back out at Wednesday, so I'm gonna have to have my hair done last"
Gonna Wednesday what?
"Erm, got a rehearsal haven't I?"
"As I say, I would like you to be in  fairly close proximity to where I am so that you can see what I'm doing and hear what I'm saying."
Er and I don't want you to be too close.
I will actually be working to start with in this area here.
So perhaps you could arrange yourselves in a semi-circle just round here.
"Right, my friends  we've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm    I do beg your pardon  when we are printing."
The one which you will have come across when we were doing lino printing was turps.
"We had to use turps didn't we, to dissolve the printing inks?"
"Can you remember that, when you did lino printing?"
Mm
But when we're doing screen printing we use very much stronger solvents  which can have a nasty effect on your skin.
You notice I have slight eczema on the palms of my hands.
"Some of us have even worse eczema, yeah?"
So it's really important that we  don't irritate our skin.
But frankly  it's not likely to irritate your skin anyway because er  you aren't industrial users of this  you would only ever touch these chemicals for a very short time so the  any possible side effects they might er have on you will be  greatly diminished by the fact that you didn't use them very much.
"If you're using them in industry, day in day out all day long, then that is the real importance of wearing protective gear."
But I'm just going to demonstrate to you just  what happens.
This lovely supple rubber here  is exactly the same supple rubber here at one time but now it's gone all hard and denatured because of the chemicals.
"So if y if the chemicals will do that over a long period of time  to rubber, think what it would do to your skin."
Does that make sense?
Mm.
These lumps have become so erm hardened by these chemicals that I can't er pick up  the  thin zinc plate from the  tub.
"I'm afraid that Mrs  has gone off with, ah Mrs   I'll be very grateful if you could bring me in a bowl."
You know the one you just took out?
You want it back?
I wonder if I could have it back please?
A a bowl.
"A a bowl, it doesn't matter which one."
"Just a plastic bowl please, washing up bowl."
Do you want anything in it?
Or just water?
Er  bring it empty and I'll .
Thank you very much.
You're a graduate.
I am yes.
Yeah I thought so anyway.
Er I
would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to impart knowledge to people than anybody else.
No I'd I'd I don't I don't believe that that's the case erm
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen come to the studio please.
Karen co sorry I just want to do something go on.
Yeah so okay I'm I'm I'm
I don't think that's the case.
I'm I'm winding you up a little bit but no I mean there's a little method in this .
When are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the Government?
Oh we're
Cos anybody can score points off them I mean it's simple.
We we well we'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years.
Well he's not going to be there for ever.
Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them.
If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them.
You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped  out of my mind .
"Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him?"
S Sir Keith Joseph?
Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph.
Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education  and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable.
And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right?
Yes.
We well I've no objections to that to that at all.
"No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now  and out he walked."
Is there a chocolate machine in the building?
And off he went.
He was addicted to chocolate.
I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and  tried to do something constructive is John McGregor.
and everything went .
"When I reached the pit bottom, there was approximately three feet of water at the pit bottom and I had my first experience of water in the mines."
Were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days?
"Well in those days er there wasn't much me much er coal cutting machine, this was all hewn by hand."
"And we had the pit ponies and where we didn't have the pit ponies drawing the hutches, which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom, then er we had to do it by hand."
And if there were h a wagon or a hutch went off the road there you were with not enough height to lift it all back off the rail again and believe me that was experience in itself.
So it was quite a difficult job then?
"It was a difficult job, yes."
Mm.
What were the erm the wages and the hours like?
"Ooh, the wages."
"I started the wages and er I didn't have much more, I started I had six and eight pence per shift."
Mm.
And er what were the hours like?
"The hours, well sometimes I would do a double shift which was sixteen hours."
"Or eight hours for a full shift, sixteen hours for a double shift."
Mm.
"And in those days we required the money and er often, very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit."
Do a double shift.
"Which meant you come home from your double er shift, went to your bed, had about four hours sleep and were back out for your normal shift again."
Was you erm in a union or anything at all at this time?
"Yes, the miners' union then was just  wasn't that that  was started was ."
"In fact there's, very near the start of the unions in and o er that, that the miners' union was one of the first to start up."
Do you think it gave you erm any advantages being in a union?
"Y oh yes it gave us advantage to the extent that we'd someone b behind us to fight for any, any er grievances that we had."
That was the idea of the union starting out in the first place.
Mhm.
We had to pay into a union.
"We can, on every Friday there was a union official down there in a small hut."
"We had straight from our wages straight to the union, it's payed at union right away."
So that there was nobody skipped.
What were the erm the erm relations between the w the workers and the bosses like?
Mm
"just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down"
Mm
"cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see"
Yeah without a guard on it
without a guard and they won't
"mm, mm"
allow that on this stand
No I can understand that I suppose
"but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing"
"Something to grip it, mm"
We would have to like pull the wood through you see
"what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er"
"Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know"
don't think you'd be very happy you know
"I mean you wouldn't wanna pay  no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth"
"Damaging them, saw, mm"
Well at least we've had a look at the whether we
"right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?"
Well I mean
What are you gonna do?
I don't know
It's impossible to do by hand
No not impossible
with a good saw
Yeah
and about ten irish navvies
One down below and one above huh
mm
"Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the  they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like  I made the cab some cabinets you know."
I want them split down that road
Which way?
And then they kept their language  kept the language.
Right.
Okay did anybody get a chance to read the paper which was about  conversation?
I just wondered  what what that came up with as it's conclusion.
W well it might be worth having a read of that.
Er okay what else?
Has anybody got any that I haven't haven't really covered yet?
Mhm.
and how erm  but it probably got a little to do with the way groups actually organize.
Whereas the boys are more  but the tend to give more .
Right.
But the girls tend  more equal responsibility and not .
What differences do you f I mean have you got any specific examples there or?
"No   Er the girls sort of say things like  perhaps ask her, Do you have any  We could get on a bit more so they don't include themselves in what they're going to do."
Whereas the boys  Give me the pie  Get off my steps or something
Mm.
Right.
Is there something  about where one girl was using what would be boys language when
Yeah.
someone else came round to her house she was like you know get off my yard
"Yeah,Yeah, so girls are perfectly capable of using those  when need be"
"Yeah, I mean I The important thing is I think the children do recognize the differences, not that they don't notice the differences, because they're Like you say they're capable of using the other if it if it suits them."
"Er I mean that goes back again to the articles which you might have about the way that parents talk to their children, and you quite often find that then very very quickly the children grow up speaking in a same way as the parent of that sex talked to the them."
"So if a child gets spoken to in a fairly direct way by imagine a female child by her father and the same female child gets spoken to in a not so direct way be her mother, then even of this The child is likely to  both version, she'll grow up using female variety because she's she can affiliate herself with her mother and I mean she knows that is  the variety she's expected to use."
I think  can't really remember I don't know  how father would use different language he's talking to his son or daughter.
Yeah that's true as well.
Er it sort of goes in four ways I mean the fathers talk more directly than the mothers whether or not it's a boy or a girl they're talking to.
"But they do talk more directly to boys than girls, so it's sort of graded in that way."
Okay who wanted to talk briefly about what people are going to write about?
Cos we haven't really sort of said anything.
Has anyone got any I mean I you don't all need to write about the same thing or anything.
Er does everyone want to do a general essay or do people want to do a s a specific thing?
You  I was in a warehouse at  served thirteen year there.
"And I was working in a large warehouse, a three floor warehouse, a grocers,grocers."
"I served there for thirteen year, became a chargehand eventually and eventually the f the firm folded up."
What were they
"Very old established firm, it was established in er eighteen fifty six."
"So it was a, a, a firm of about a hundred years standing at that time."
But the both brothers who owned it er Charles er John and Tom  were becoming very very aged and were not capable of carrying on the job.
And they approached the son who wasn't interested so they just folded up.
What were the conditions like where you worked in the warehouse?
"Ah well we, we actually made our own condition and this is one time, I'm telling you again, where my union membership came in very handy."
I actually made it a  union firm .
So you unionized the whole firm then?
Organ organized it.
Organized the people inside it.
And I explained to them  what benefits they were getting.
Mm.
Although the employer was pretty reasonable to us he p always payed us sixpence above the rate.
Above the normal rate.
What was the erm the employer's attitude to you unionizing and organizing and
"Oh oh he didn't say, he says oh just a, it'll not worry me he says, whether you er start one or not he says."
"I pay my men sixpence over the, the rate."
"So I says well thank you very much, but still for mu l people benefit themselves."
Mm.
"They're better being in a union, he says I agree with you, quite agree with you."
"The union fights for  he says, and the union's a  but I'm one of these employers who paying them, my men a plus rate, so I'm paying men sixpence plus over the normal rate so there was no difficulty there."
Mhm.
So he obviously wouldn't have thought the union would have been much of a threat to him seeing as he
"No, no it didn't  because he was prepared to pay over er above the rate ."
The union already fought for that rate and they got it.
But he was paying them sixpence above the rate so there was no problem to him.
Did you notice much differences in the work once you got promoted to a chargehand?
"Well er there was  I didn't do so much of the normal grafting naturally, but I was always, if there was a new man came on the job they would always  learns."
he's got  times
Time
"when ready, weight, number of packages, destination, and then haz"
Well done.
Haz will do nicely for me.
"That's what we're really looking for, hazardous"
Yeah.
goods.
Well done.
"Because, how can I say"
"Even, even I take"
"we've, you'll see, I mean there's a, not a very good illustration of a, the hub with the yellow walls of the, the conveyer belt behind you, but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in."
"The more, er er sophisticated erm  wholesale er  distributors now  know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they?"
"And, they may have one display displayed, but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your  you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's illustrating a Flymo  lawn mower or something and, and it'll, er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging, but, a lot of people for pilferage reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate, from our point of view, what's on the package."
But you must know what's in it.
"Just knowing the size and the weight isn't, you might, that's alright, that's only for the price  what's in it is vital  because  if I asked the sales people  from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them?"
"Do reme , can yo , can I, can you guess at how many would say I don't know?"
Major customers.
Half a dozen.
"It's a lo , I, I'd sa , they wouldn't admit it Bill, they might say something like erm  oh it's electronics, but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic."
Would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box.
"You don't put , you shouldn't, but you should know."
You should declare it.
"They should declare if it's hazardous, infectious, infested,i it will, what's word you used?"
Incestuous weren't it?
Incestuous?
Was that a word.
Infested.
"Infested, contaminated"
Yes it is.
or fragile goods.
"Dangerous,haz really, he should declare it, and people don't you know, unless you ask."
Yes.
so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few
Mhm.
years has has  is an experiment.
How do you feel about that?
"I, don't mind being used as a guinea pig because I feel that it'll help people in the future."
Up there.
I believe that we have been given the right to have dominion over animals.
"The point I would like to put over is, I've listened to one or two erm, radio programmes, and television programmes about this and I personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals."
I don't think us  er er  public people really realize what is going on and I think then they would maybe stand up and be
Mm.
"and be counted, but I think we've tended to stand back and just say  well we know it's going on but what is actually being  done to these"
Mhm.
animals?
Yes?
"Yes, we  that lady over said there were guidelines, there were people that go in and inspect, but there are not enough, it is a known fact, that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal  erm, experimentations are taking place  and, I love animals, and alright, yes,yo you can do ex , some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel!"
"That lady up there said that we have experiments, I'm sure, human  experiments , you know, experiments, sorry, on human people"
Mm.
"but, on human beings, but we're not put through the state that animals are!"
We
Mm.
"don't have great lumps made to grown on us, we don't go through she , severe pain."
"And, which company was it that says, to  do something about pain  you first have to create it."
Mm.
"Ah, I mean that's terrible!"
"I was responsible for researching into the, so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty, and it was a real can of worms!"
I was
Yep!
I was sorry I got involved in it at one point!
Erm  cosmetic companies are very devious!
It's what they don't tell you that's important.
"Erm, there is a big problem at the moment with cosmetic labelling, for example, erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean?"
"I think some of them do , yes, I know s er some of them have said how much they enjoyed it when it started off first, but er  but now it's just got that wee bit more serious."
"We're with the plays, with going to the festival of course, you can't,you must be serious when you're practising for something like that ."
"Do you feel like it's almost like doing a different thing that you're not, you know when you're actually acting in the play you're more self conscious and you're more conscious of what you're you're moving and you're speaking and whereas the likes of the panto you know you just be yourself really with a bit of fun thrown in ."
"Yeah, yes, oh yes aye the plays  the plays you've got to  think what you're doing wand if you miss your cue line you're putting your, the person next, off as well that it is more  er serious and you've got to think more I think"
Mhm.
really.
But however
"So you just kind of kept kept on singing, after the choir and that finished?"
"Aha, when the pantomime started up that was just carried on in there."
"Not that I'm a great, good or great singer it's just  I seem to have a strong voice."
Unfortunately you can always hear me above everybody else.
Oh dear.
"That's, you can"
But if er if folks spoke about you you know they would they would say you were a singer?
"Because you're seen in public and you do sing in public, there's a lot of people that sing but as you say it's sometimes just in their own homes or they used to but they would never sing in public ,they used to sing in the choir ."
"Yes, sing in public, no no."
"I've I wouldn't  I don't think I would go out if somebody said, Would you come  and sing  er at such and such a thing."
I I don't think I would go.
"But in the pantomime, well you're singing with everybody else, you're not er on your own really."
And the pantomimes a different thing altogether.
Mhm.
"And I mun that  I must have words in front of me, if I don't have words in front of me even though I know it, I I still forget it."
But er
"That's right, just nerves."
I think it's the nervousness that just knocks the words coming out of your head.
"Oh,"
It's easy to do.
Aha.
oh aye.
But er  do you quite like singing for folk that know you?
"Do you like singing in the village, where everybody knows you, or would you in some ways be less nervous do you think if you were singing like even to  folk,who just don't  so well ?"
Quite know me so well?
"Er this has been altered quite a lot since then, but you can still see the er gate that was er to the yard of the station."
"Moving on, to ."
"Again, er early nineteen hundreds, and you can see single track coming in from  here, and interesting bit of track work here, erm station up here."
Double track through the station.
"Erm goods shed, er and er siding along here."
So interesting type of track work there.
"Now when the  was opened, er it was decided to er to put in a line, erm just near  to connect with , and pick up some of the trade for the for  Railway, cos the  or the  had already decided to get some from that end as well."
Er going up to erm  and so on.
"So a line was put in, up to Colliery."
"And there you have, not a very good picture, but you can see this was th with the goods shed as per the last  ordnance survey map."
"Slightly altered configuration, but er tracks put in there, erm and er to house quite a lot of wagons and to er allow trains to er to just be held there until they could move up to erm cos that's single track beyond there."
"That was the quite enlarged quite enlarged er sidings, erm these haven't been changed here, but additional sidings on this side er and I say that curve up here."
"Erm just look at that one that er goods shed, that's er that's interesting cos er there's still remains of that there."
There you can see  Station.
Station master's house there.
Erm and the I can never remember the name of that road over there.
Er   o this is  Road down here isn't it?
"Anyhow, erm that's in a cutting there."
And you can see the track layout.
"I say in interesting, if you built that in a model, people wouldn't believe you."
"There's a picture in early B R days, of a I think erm special probably from ."
"And showing that even if the er station isn't actually used for passenger traffic, er it's well kept."
Now let's look down from the bridge.
"And there you see  again in early B R days, er the er the station master's house, and er er and the station itself, over here, the goods shed over there , the various track works coming across, the er line up to round here, and as I say the various sidings that were put in to accommodate the additional er colliery and other traffic."
"But er considering it isn't er used for passengers, it looks in quite good nick, doesn't it really that."
"But I say that er just er look at that, and look at the particular roof line."
"And er the the vent there, the circular vent."
Now that's what it looks like more or less now.
Er looking just er well that picture of that  going through th station on a special.
That's roughly  the same place.
Well just a few yards along.
"Picture from the from the er bridge, and there you can see the goods sheds still there."
"Then they all took ship and sailed home , and when they came to the princess 's country , Hans disguised himself as the sovereign of a neighbouring kingdom , and went up to the palace alone ."
"He was given a hearty welcome by the king , who prided himself on his hospitality , and a banquet was commanded in his honour ."
"That evening , whilst they sat drinking their wine , Hans said to the king : ' I have heard the fame of your majesty 's wisdom , and I have travelled from far to ask your counsel ."
A man in my country has buried his daughter alive because she loved a youth who was born a peasant .
"How shall I punish this unnatural father , for it is left to me to give judgment ? '"
"The king , who was still truly grieved for his daughter 's loss , answered quickly : ` Burn him alive , and strew his ashes all over the kingdom . '"
"Hans looked at him steadily for a moment , and then threw off his disguise ."
"` You are the man , ' said he ; ` and I am he who loved your daughter , and became a gold ring on her finger ."
"She is safe , and waiting not far from here ; but you have pronounced judgment on yourself . '"
"Then the king fell on his knees and begged for mercy ; and as he had in other respects been a good father , they forgave him ."
The wedding of Hans and the princess was celebrated with great festivities which lasted a month .
As for the hill-man he intended to be present ; but whilst he was walking along a street which led to the palace a loose stone fell on his head and killed him .

"The Cat 's Elopement -LSB- From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty , with a skin as soft and shining as silk , and wise green eyes , that could see even in the dark ."
"His name was Gon , and he belonged to a music teacher , who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world ."
Now not far from the music master 's house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma .
"She was such a little dear altogether , and blinked her eyes so daintily , and ate her supper so tidily , and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue , that her mistress was never tired of saying , ` Koma , Koma , what should I do without you ? '"
"Well , it happened one day that these two , when out for an evening stroll , met under a cherry tree , and in one moment fell madly in love with each other ."
"Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife , for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy ; but he was not easy to please , and did not care about any of them ."
"Now , before he had time to think , Cupid had entangled him in his net , and he was filled with love towards Koma ."
"She fully returned his passion , but , like a woman , she saw the difficulties in the way , and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them ."
"Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma , but her mistress would not part from her ."
"Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady , but he declined to listen to any such suggestion , so everything remained as before ."
"At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves , and to seek their fortunes together ."
"So one moonlight night they stole away , and ventured out into an unknown world ."
"All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine , till they had left their homes far behind them , and towards evening they found themselves in a large park ."
"The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired , and the grass looked very soft and inviting , and the trees cast cool deep shadows , when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise , in the shape of a big , big dog !"
"He came springing towards them showing all his teeth , and Koma shrieked , and rushed up a cherry tree ."
"Gon , however , stood his ground boldly , and prepared to give battle , for he felt that Koma 's eyes were upon him , and that he must not run away ."
"But , alas !"
"his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him , for he was large and powerful , and very fierce ."
"You have got a conscience , though you are a little boy , and you must learn to mind it . ''"
"`` Well , my conscience did n't prick me a bit when she said ` Let 's get over the wall , ' '' answered Rob , quoting one of Demi 's expressions ."
`` Did you stop to see if it did ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Then you can not tell . ''
"`` I guess it 's such a little conscience that it do n't prick hard enough for me to feel it , '' added Rob , after thinking the matter over for a minute ."
`` We must sharpen it up .
"It 's bad to have a dull conscience ; so you may stay here till dinner-time , and talk about it with Nan ."
I trust you both not to untie yourselves till I say the word . ''
"`` No , we wo n't , '' said both , feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping to punish themselves ."
"For an hour they were very good , then they grew tired of one room , and longed to get out ."
"Never had the hall seemed so inviting ; even the little bedroom acquired a sudden interest , and they would gladly have gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed ."
"The open windows drove them wild because they could not reach them ; and the outer world seemed so beautiful , they wondered how they ever found the heart to say it was dull ."
"Nan pined for a race round the lawn , and Rob remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning , and wondered what poor Pollux would do ."
"They watched the clock , and Nan did some nice calculations in minutes and seconds , while Rob learned to tell all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them ."
"It was maddening to smell the dinner , to know that there was to be succotash and huckleberry pudding , and to feel that they would not be on the spot to secure good helps of both ."
"When Mary Ann began to set the table , they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there was to be ; and Nan offered to help her make the beds , if she would only see that she had `` lots of sauce on her pudding . ''"
"When the boys came bursting out of school , they found the children tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts , and were much edified , as well as amused , by the sequel to the exciting adventures of the night ."
"`` Untie me now , Marmar ; my conscience will prick like a pin next time , I know it will , '' said Rob , as the bell rang , and Teddy came to look at him with sorrowful surprise ."
"`` We shall see , '' answered his mother , setting him free ."
"He took a good run down the hall , back through the dining-room , and brought up beside Nan , quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction ."
"`` I 'll bring her dinner to her , may I ? ''"
"he asked , pitying his fellow-captive ."
`` That 's my kind little son !
"Yes , pull out the table , and get a chair ; '' and Mrs. Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others , who were always in a raging state of hunger at noon ."
"Nan ate alone , and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa ."
"Mrs. Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window ; and there she stood watching the boys play , and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty ."
"Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn , so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it ."
"Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her ; Demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself , which amused Nan a good deal ; and Dan brought a little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power ."
But nothing atoned for the loss of freedom ; and a few hours of confinement taught Nan how precious it was .
A good many thoughts went through the little head that lay on the window-sill during the last quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emil 's new ship launched .
"She was to have christened it , and had depended on smashing a tiny bottle of currant-wine over the prow as it was named Josephine in honor of Mrs. Bhaer ."
"Merry hated clearing up , but dutifully did every distasteful task , and kept her eye on careless Roxy till all was in order ; then she gladly went to perch on her father 's knee , seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the `` little one . ''"
"`` Yes , I do want something , but I know you will say it is silly , '' she began , as her father pinched her blooming cheek , with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well ."
"`` Should n't wonder if it was a doll now ; '' and Mr. Grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile , as if she was about six instead of fifteen ."
"`` Why , father , you know I do n't !"
I have n't played with dollies for years and years .
"No ; I want to fix up my room pretty , like Jill 's ."
"I 'll do it all myself , and only want a few things , for I do n't expect it to look as nice as hers . ''"
"Indignation gave Merry courage to state her wishes boldly , though she knew the boys would laugh ."
"They did , and her mother said in a tone of surprise , -- `` Why , child , what more can you want ?"
"I 'm sure your room is always as neat as a new pin , thanks to your bringing up , and I told you to have a fire there whenever you wanted to . ''"
"`` Let me have some old things out of the garret , and I 'll show you what I want ."
"It is neat , but so bare and ugly I hate to be there ."
I do so love something pretty to look at ! ''
and Merry gave a little shiver of disgust as she turned her eyes away from the large greasy boot Dick was holding up to be sure it was well lubricated all round .
"`` So do I , and that 's a fact ."
"I could n't get on without my pretty girl here , any way ."
"Why , she touches up the old place better than a dozen flower-pots in full blow , '' said the farmer , as his eye went from the scarlet geranium to the bright young face so near his own ."
`` I wish I had a dozen in the sitting-room window .
"Mother says they are not tidy , but I 'd keep them neat , and I know you 'd like it , '' broke in Merry , glad of the chance to get one of the long-desired wishes of her heart fulfilled ."
`` I 'll fetch you some next time I go over to Ballad 's .
"Tell me what you want , and we 'll have a posy bed somewhere round , see if we do n't , '' said her father , dimly understanding what she wanted ."
"`` Now , if mother says I may fix my room , I shall be satisfied , and I 'll do my chores without a bit of fuss , to show how grateful I am , '' said the girl , thanking her father with a kiss , and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse ."
`` You may have anything you like out of the blue chest .
"There 's a lot of things there that the moths got at after Grandma died , and I could n't bear to throw or give 'em away ."
"Trim up your room as you like , and mind you do n't forget your part of the bargain , '' answered Mrs. Grant , seeing profit in the plan ."
"`` I wo n't ; I 'll work all the morning to-morrow , and in the afternoon I 'll get ready to show you what I call a nice , pretty room , '' answered Merry , looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen ."
"She kept her word , and the very stormy afternoon when Jill got into trouble , Merry was working busily at her little bower ."
"In the blue chest she found a variety of treasures , and ignoring the moth holes , used them to the best advantage , trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance which prevailed in Mrs. Minot 's back bedroom ."
"Three faded red-moreen curtains went up at the windows over the chilly paper shades , giving a pleasant glow to the bare walls ."
"A red quilt with white stars , rather the worse for many washings , covered the bed , and a gay cloth the table , where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots ."
"The little air-tight stove was banished , and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the fire-light ."
"Grandma 's last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth , and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau , over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt , tied up with Merry 's red sash ."
"He gave me one look as much as to say , `` Well done , David ! ''"
and off he set again at his top speed .
It grew cooler and even a little darker -LRB- but not much -RRB- with the coming of the night .
"The sky was cloudless ; it was still early in July , and pretty far north ; in the darkest part of that night , you would have needed pretty good eyes to read , but for all that , I have often seen it darker in a winter mid-day ."
Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain ; and this refreshed me for a while .
"When we stopped to breathe , and I had time to see all about me , the clearness and sweetness of the night , the shapes of the hills like things asleep , and the fire dwindling away behind us , like a bright spot in the midst of the moor , anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm ."
"By what I have read in books , I think few that have held a pen were ever really wearied , or they would write of it more strongly ."
"I had no care of my life , neither past nor future , and I scarce remembered there was such a lad as David Balfour ."
"I did not think of myself , but just of each fresh step which I was sure would be my last , with despair -- and of Alan , who was the cause of it , with hatred ."
"Alan was in the right trade as a soldier ; this is the officer 's part to make men continue to do things , they know not wherefore , and when , if the choice was offered , they would lie down where they were and be killed ."
"And I dare say I would have made a good enough private ; for in these last hours it never occurred to me that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able , and die obeying ."
"Day began to come in , after years , I thought ; and by that time we were past the greatest danger , and could walk upon our feet like men , instead of crawling like brutes ."
"But , dear heart have mercy !"
"what a pair we must have made , going double like old grandfathers , stumbling like babes , and as white as dead folk ."
"Never a word passed between us ; each set his mouth and kept his eyes in front of him , and lifted up his foot and set it down again , like people lifting weights at a country play ; * all the while , with the moorfowl crying `` peep ! ''"
"in the heather , and the light coming slowly clearer in the east ."
* Village fair .
I say Alan did as I did .
"Not that ever I looked at him , for I had enough ado to keep my feet ; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself , and looked as little where we were going , or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men ."
It fell in this way .
"We were going down a heathery brae , Alan leading and I following a pace or two behind , like a fiddler and his wife ; when upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle , three or four ragged men leaped out , and the next moment we were lying on our backs , each with a dirk at his throat ."
I do n't think I cared ; the pain of this rough handling was quite swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full ; and I was too glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk .
"I lay looking up in the face of the man that held me ; and I mind his face was black with the sun , and his eyes very light , but I was not afraid of him ."
I heard Alan and another whispering in the Gaelic ; and what they said was all one to me .
"Then the dirks were put up , our weapons were taken away , and we were set face to face , sitting in the heather ."
"`` They are Cluny 's men , '' said Alan ."
`` We couldnae have fallen better .
"We 're just to bide here with these , which are his out-sentries , till they can get word to the chief of my arrival . ''"
"Now Cluny Macpherson , the chief of the clan Vourich , had been one of the leaders of the great rebellion six years before ; there was a price on his life ; and I had supposed him long ago in France , with the rest of the heads of that desperate party ."
"Even tired as I was , the surprise of what I heard half wakened me ."
"`` What , '' I cried , `` is Cluny still here ? ''"
"`` Ay , is he so ! ''"
But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements .
"If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade , he argued , they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold ."
Nor had we much time left to us for thought .
"Suddenly , with a loud huzza , a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade ."
"At the same moment , the fire was once more opened from the woods , and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor 's musket into bits ."
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys .
"Squire and Gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside ."
"But of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees ."
"Two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house ."
"The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building , shouting as they ran , and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them ."
"Several shots were fired , but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect ."
"In a moment , the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us ."
"The head of Job Anderson , the boatswain , appeared at the middle loophole ."
"`` At 'em , all hands -- all hands ! ''"
he roared in a voice of thunder .
"At the same moment , another pirate grasped Hunter 's musket by the muzzle , wrenched it from his hands , plucked it through the loophole , and with one stunning blow , laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor ."
"Meanwhile a third , running unharmed all around the house , appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor ."
Our position was utterly reversed .
"A moment since we were firing , under cover , at an exposed enemy ; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow ."
"The log-house was full of smoke , to which we owed our comparative safety ."
"Cries and confusion , the flashes and reports of pistol-shots , and one loud groan rang in my ears ."
"`` Out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open !"
Cutlasses ! ''
cried the captain .
"I snatched a cutlass from the pile , and someone , at the same time snatching another , gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt ."
I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight .
"Someone was close behind , I knew not whom ."
"Right in front , the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill , and just as my eyes fell upon him , beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face ."
"`` Round the house , lads !"
Round the house ! ''
"cried the captain ; and even in the hurly-burly , I perceived a change in his voice ."
"Mechanically , I obeyed , turned eastwards , and with my cutlass raised , ran round the corner of the house ."
"She slept peacefully till midnight , when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke ."
"Everything trembled and shook ; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall ; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations , it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down , and then the roof fell in with a crash ."
"Then all became still , and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep ."
"But when she awoke again in broad daylight , what a sight met her eyes !"
"She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour ; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground ; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet , and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls ."
"The maiden thought she must be dreaming , but in came three servants richly dressed , who asked what were her commands ."
"` Go , ' said the maiden , ' I will get up at once and cook the old man 's supper for him , and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow . '"
"But the door opened and in came a handsome young man , who said , ' I am a king 's son , and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants , who were transformed into a cock , a hen , and a brindled cow ."
The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts .
"You are that maiden , and last night at midnight we were freed , and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace ."
As they stood there the king 's son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden 's parents to be present at the wedding feast .
` But where are my two sisters ? '
asked the maid . '
"I shut them up in the cellar , but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved , and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry . '"
"Uraschimataro and the Turtle From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- ."
"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing ."
"They had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot ."
"This son 's name was Uraschimataro , which means in Japanese , ` Son of the island , ' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather ."
"Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ` If your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . '"
"But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him ."
"One beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle ."
"He was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life ."
"` After all , ' it said , ` what good can I do you ?"
"I am so young and small , and I would so gladly live a little longer ."
"Be merciful and set me free , and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . '"
"Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea ."
"Years flew by , and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea ."
"But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves ."
Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .
"But he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore ."
"Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' I am the turtle whose life you once saved ."
I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude .
`` But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson ? ''
"says he , when I had done ."
"`` I think so , indeed , sir , '' said I. `` Dear doctor ! ''"
"cries he , rubbing his brow ."
`` Dear doctor !
"No , Mr. David , I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible ."
"I say nothing against your friend , Mr. Thomson : I know nothing against him ; and if I did -- mark this , Mr. David !"
-- it would be my duty to lay hands on him .
Now I put it to you : is it wise to meet ?
He may have matters to his charge .
He may not have told you all .
His name may not be even Thomson ! ''
"cries the lawyer , twinkling ; `` for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws . ''"
"`` You must be the judge , sir , '' said I ."
"But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy , for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs. Rankeillor ; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine , ere he was back harping on my proposal ."
"When and where was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson ; was I sure of Mr. T. 's discretion ; supposing we could catch the old fox tripping , would I consent to such and such a term of an agreement -- these and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals , while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue ."
"When I had answered all of them , seemingly to his contentment , he fell into a still deeper muse , even the claret being now forgotten ."
"Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil , and set to work writing and weighing every word ; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber ."
"`` Torrance , '' said he , `` I must have this written out fair against to-night ; and when it is done , you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me , for you will probably be wanted as a witness . ''"
"`` What , sir , '' cried I , as soon as the clerk was gone , `` are you to venture it ? ''"
"`` Why , so it would appear , '' says he , filling his glass ."
`` But let us speak no more of business .
"The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago , when I had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh ."
"Each had gone his proper errand ; and when it came four o'clock , Torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master , and I , who had forgot my spectacles , was so blind without them , that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk . ''"
And thereupon he laughed heartily .
"I said it was an odd chance , and smiled out of politeness ; but what held me all the afternoon in wonder , he kept returning and dwelling on this story , and telling it again with fresh details and laughter ; so that I began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friend 's folly ."
"Towards the time I had appointed with Alan , we set out from the house , Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm , and Torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand ."
"All through the town , the lawyer was bowing right and left , and continually being button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business ; and I could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county ."
"At last we were clear of the houses , and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier , the scene of my misfortune ."
"I could not look upon the place without emotion , recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more : Ransome taken , I could hope , from the evil to come ; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him ; and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge ."
"All these , and the brig herself , I had outlived ; and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scath ."
My only thought should have been of gratitude ; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear .
"There was no way , think , plan , worry as she might ."
And if she could not !
"Marcella remembered Patty 's face and the doctor 's look , and her heart sank like lead ."
"Patty was growing weaker every day instead of stronger , and the weather was getting hotter ."
"Oh , if Patty were to -- to -- but Marcella could not complete the sentence even in thought ."
If they were not so desperately poor !
Marcella 's bitterness overflowed her soul at the thought .
Everywhere around her were evidences of wealth -- wealth often lavishly and foolishly spent -- and she could not get money enough anywhere to save her sister 's life !
"She almost felt that she hated all those smiling , well-dressed people who thronged the streets ."
"By the time she reached the store , poor Marcella 's heart was seething with misery and resentment ."
"Three years before , when Marcella had been sixteen and Patty nine , their parents had died , leaving them absolutely alone in the world except for their father 's half-sister , Miss Gibson , who lived in Canning and earned her livelihood washing and mending for the hands employed in the big factory nearby ."
"She had grudgingly offered the girls a home , which Marcella had accepted because she must ."
"She obtained a position in one of the Canning stores at three dollars a week , out of which she contrived to dress herself and Patty and send the latter to school ."
"Her life for three years was one of absolute drudgery , yet until now she had never lost courage , but had struggled bravely on , hoping for better times in the future when she should get promotion and Patty would be old enough to teach school ."
But now Marcella 's courage and hopefulness had gone out like a spent candle .
"She was late at the store , and that meant a fine ; her head ached , and her feet felt like lead as she climbed the stairs to her department -- a hot , dark , stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter ."
"It was warm and close at any time , but today it was stifling , and there was already a crowd of customers , for it was the day of a bargain sale ."
The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella 's tortured nerves .
"She felt that she wanted to scream , but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer -- a big , handsome , richly dressed woman ."
Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year .
She was Mrs. Liddell -- Marcella knew her by sight -- and she was in a very bad temper because she had been kept waiting .
For the next half hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction .
Nothing suited her .
"Pile after pile , box after box , of shirtwaists did Marcella take down for her , only to have them flung aside with sarcastic remarks ."
Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella responsible for the lack of waists that suited her ; her tongue grew sharper and sharper and her comments more trying .
"Then she mislaid her purse , and was disagreeable about that until it turned up ."
Marcella shut her lips so tightly that they turned white to keep back the impatient retort that rose momentarily to her lips .
"The insolence of some customers was always trying to the sensitive , high-spirited girl , but today it seemed unbearable ."
"Her head throbbed fiercely with the pain of the ever-increasing ache , and -- what was the lady on her right saying to a friend ?"
"`` Yes , she had typhoid , you know -- a very bad form ."
"She rallied from it , but she was so exhausted that she could n't really recover , and the doctor said -- '' `` Really , '' interrupted Mrs. Liddell 's sharp voice , `` may I ask you to attend to me , if you please ?"
"No doubt gossip may be very interesting to you , but I am accustomed to having a clerk pay some small attention to my requirements ."
"We had a dreary morning 's work before us , for there was no sign of any wind , and the boats had to be got out and manned , and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island ."
"I volunteered for one of the boats , where I had , of course , no business ."
"The heat was sweltering , and the men grumbled fiercely over their work ."
"Anderson was in command of my boat , and instead of keeping the crew in order , he grumbled as loud as the worst ."
"`` Well , '' he said with an oath , `` it 's not forever . ''"
"I thought this was a very bad sign , for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline ."
"All the way in , Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship ."
"He knew the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart , John never hesitated once ."
"`` There 's a strong scour with the ebb , '' he said , `` and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . ''"
"We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other ."
The bottom was clean sand .
"The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods , but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent ."
"The place was entirely land-locked , buried in woods , the trees coming right down to high-water mark , the shores mostly flat , and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there ."
"Two little rivers , or rather two swamps , emptied out into this pond , as you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness ."
"From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they were quite buried among trees ; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion , we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas ."
"There was not a breath of air moving , nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside ."
A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage -- a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks .
"I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone tasting a bad egg ."
"`` I do n't know about treasure , '' he said , `` but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . ''"
"If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat , it became truly threatening when they had come aboard ."
They lay about the deck growling together in talk .
The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed .
"Even the honest hands must have caught the infection , for there was not one man aboard to mend another ."
"Mutiny , it was plain , hung over us like a thunder-cloud ."
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger .
"Long John was hard at work going from group to group , spending himself in good advice , and as for example no man could have shown a better ."
He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility ; he was all smiles to everyone .
"If an order were given , John would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheeriest `` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"in the world ; and when there was nothing else to do , he kept up one song after another , as if to conceal the discontent of the rest ."
"Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst ."
We held a council in the cabin .
"`` Sir , '' said the captain , `` if I risk another order , the whole ship 'll come about our ears by the run ."
"And now , '' said she when I had done so , `` we have to get the key off THAT ; and who 's to touch it , I should like to know ! ''"
and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words .
I went down on my knees at once .
"On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper , blackened on the one side ."
"I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT ; and taking it up , I found written on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : `` You have till ten tonight . ''"
"`` He had till ten , Mother , '' said I ; and just as I said it , our old clock began striking ."
"This sudden noise startled us shockingly ; but the news was good , for it was only six ."
"`` Now , Jim , '' she said , `` that key . ''"
"I felt in his pockets , one after another ."
"A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair ."
"`` Perhaps it 's round his neck , '' suggested my mother ."
"Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his own gully , we found the key ."
At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival .
"It was like any other seaman 's chest on the outside , the initial `` B '' burned on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long , rough usage ."
"`` Give me the key , '' said my mother ; and though the lock was very stiff , she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling ."
"A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior , but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brushed and folded ."
"They had never been worn , my mother said ."
"Under that , the miscellany began -- a quadrant , a tin canikin , several sticks of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistols , a piece of bar silver , an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compasses mounted with brass , and five or six curious West Indian shells ."
"I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunted life ."
"In the meantime , we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets , and neither of these were in our way ."
"Underneath there was an old boat-cloak , whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar ."
"My mother pulled it up with impatience , and there lay before us , the last things in the chest , a bundle tied up in oilcloth , and looking like papers , and a canvas bag that gave forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold ."
"`` I 'll show these rogues that I 'm an honest woman , '' said my mother ."
"`` I 'll have my dues , and not a farthing over ."
Hold Mrs. Crossley 's bag . ''
And she began to count over the amount of the captain 's score from the sailor 's bag into the one that I was holding .
"It was a long , difficult business , for the coins were of all countries and sizes -- doubloons , and louis d'ors , and guineas , and pieces of eight , and I know not what besides , all shaken together at random ."
"The guineas , too , were about the scarcest , and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count ."
"When we were about half-way through , I suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth -- the tap-tapping of the blind man 's stick upon the frozen road ."
"It drew nearer and nearer , while we sat holding our breath ."
"Then it struck sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter ; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without ."
"At last the tapping recommenced , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard ."
"`` Mother , '' said I , `` take the whole and let 's be going , '' for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet 's nest about our ears , though how thankful I was that I had bolted it , none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man ."
"But my mother , frightened as she was , would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less ."
"It was not yet seven , she said , by a long way ; she knew her rights and she would have them ; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill ."
"That was enough , and more than enough , for both of us ."
"`` I 'll take what I have , '' she said , jumping to her feet ."
"`` And I 'll take this to square the count , '' said I , picking up the oilskin packet ."
"Next moment we were both groping downstairs , leaving the candle by the empty chest ; and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat ."
We had not started a moment too soon .
The fog was rapidly dispersing ; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side ; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape .
"Far less than half-way to the hamlet , very little beyond the bottom of the hill , we must come forth into the moonlight ."
"Nor was this all , for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears , and as we looked back in their direction , a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern ."
"`` My dear , '' said my mother suddenly , `` take the money and run on ."
I am going to faint . ''
"This was certainly the end for both of us , I thought ."
"How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours ; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed , for her past foolhardiness and present weakness !"
"We were just at the little bridge , by good fortune ; and I helped her , tottering as she was , to the edge of the bank , where , sure enough , she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder ."
"I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all , and I am afraid it was roughly done , but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch ."
"Farther I could not move her , for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it ."
So there we had to stay -- my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn .
"5 The Last of the Blind Man MY curiosity , in a sense , was stronger than my fear , for I could not remain where I was , but crept back to the bank again , whence , sheltering my head behind a bush of broom , I might command the road before our door ."
"I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive , seven or eight of them , running hard , their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front ."
"Three men ran together , hand in hand ; and I made out , even through the mist , that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar ."
The next moment his voice showed me that I was right .
`` Down with the door ! ''
he cried .
"`` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"answered two or three ; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow , the lantern-bearer following ; and then I could see them pause , and hear speeches passed in a lower key , as if they were surprised to find the door open ."
"But the pause was brief , for the blind man again issued his commands ."
"His voice sounded louder and higher , as if he were afire with eagerness and rage ."
"`` In , in , in ! ''"
"he shouted , and cursed them for their delay ."
"Four or five of them obeyed at once , two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar ."
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , where Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
-LSB- Illustration : There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk -RSB- She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this : he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow . '"
"O you naughty , naughty child ! '"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but a chrysanthemum heard her , and said so pointedly , ` Hoity-toity , what is this ? '"
that she had to come out and show herself .
Then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do .
"-LSB- Illustration : An afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow -RSB- ` Of course it is no affair of ours , ' a spindle-tree said after they had whispered together , ` but you know quite well you ought not to be here , and perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies ; what do you think yourself ? ' '"
"I think you should not , ' Maimie replied , which so perplexed them that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her . '"
"I would n't ask it of you , ' she assured them , ` if I thought it was wrong , ' and of course after this they could not well carry tales ."
"They then said , ` Well-a-day , ' and ` Such is life , ' for they can be frightfully sarcastic ; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches , and she said good-naturedly , ` Before I go to the fairies ' ball , I should like to take you for a walk one at a time ; you can lean on me , you know . '"
"At this they clapped their hands , and she escorted them up the Baby Walk and back again , one at a time , putting an arm or a finger round the very frail , setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous , and treating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the English , though she could not understand a word they said ."
"They behaved well on the whole , though some whimpered that she had not taken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy , and others jagged her , but it was quite unintentional , and she was too much of a lady to cry out ."
"So much walking tired her , and she was anxious to be off to the ball , but she no longer felt afraid ."
"The reason she felt no more fear was that it was now night-time , and in the dark , you remember , Maimie was always rather strange ."
"They were now loth to let her go , for , ` If the fairies see you , ' they warned her , ` they will mischief you -- stab you to death , or compel you to nurse their children , or turn you into something tedious , like an evergreen oak . '"
"As they said this they looked with affected pity at an evergreen oak , for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens ."
"` Oh , la ! '"
"replied the oak bitingly , ` how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering . '"
"This made them sulky , though they had really brought it on themselves , and they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that would face her if she insisted on going to the ball ."
"-LSB- Illustration : She ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid -RSB- She learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual good temper at present , the cause being the tantalising heart of the Duke of Christmas Daisies ."
"He was an Oriental fairy , very poorly of a dreadful complaint , namely , inability to love , and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them ."
"Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet , to vex her still more ; for she had always tucked them inside it , because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night ."
Then he nearly cried ; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead ; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it .
"Sometimes , though not often , he had dreams , and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys ."
"For hours he could not be separated from these dreams , though he wailed piteously in them ."
"They had to do , I think , with the riddle of his existence ."
"At such times it had been Wendy 's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap , soothing him in dear ways of her own invention , and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up , so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him ."
But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep .
"One arm dropped over the edge of the bed , one leg was arched , and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth , which was open , showing the little pearls ."
Thus defenceless Hook found him .
He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy .
Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast ?
"The man was not wholly evil ; he loved flowers -LRB- I have been told -RRB- and sweet music -LRB- he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord -RRB- ; and , let it be frankly admitted , the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly ."
"Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree , but for one thing ."
What stayed him was Peter 's impertinent appearance as he slept .
"The open mouth , the drooping arm , the arched knee : they were such a personification of cockiness as , taken together , will never again , one may hope , be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness ."
They steeled Hook 's heart .
"If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident , and leapt at the sleeper ."
"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed , Hook stood in darkness himself , and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle , the door of Slightly 's tree ."
"It did not entirely fill the aperture , and he had been looking over it ."
"Feeling for the catch , he found to his fury that it was low down , beyond his reach ."
"To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter 's face and figure visibly increased , and he rattled the door and flung himself against it ."
Was his enemy to escape him after all ?
But what was that ?
The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter 's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach .
"He fathomed what it was straightaway , and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power ."
"Lest he should be taken alive , Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug , blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession ."
"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science , which was probably the most virulent poison in existence ."
Five drops of this he now added to Peter 's cup .
"His hand shook , but it was in exultation rather than in shame ."
"As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper , but not lest pity should unnerve him ; merely to avoid spilling ."
"Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim , and turning , wormed his way with difficulty up the tree ."
As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole .
"` That does n't matter , ' said Peter , as if he were the only person present who knew all about it , though he was really the one who knew least ."
` What we need is just a nice motherly person . '
` Oh dear ! '
"Wendy said , ` you see I feel that is exactly what I am . '"
"` It is , it is , ' they all cried ; ` we saw it at once . '"
"` Very well , ' she said , ' I will do my best ."
"Come inside at once , you naughty children ; I am sure your feet are damp ."
And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella . '
"In they went ; I do n't know how there was room for them , but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland ."
And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy .
"By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees , but she herself slept that night in the little house , and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword , for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl ."
"The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness , with a bright light showing through its blinds , and the chimney smoking beautifully , and Peter standing on guard ."
"After a time he fell asleep , and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy ."
"Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed , but they just tweaked Peter 's nose and passed on ."
-LSB- Illustration : PETER ON GUARD -RSB- CHAPTER VII THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees .
"Hook , you remember , had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece , but this was ignorance , for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down , and no two of the boys were quite the same size ."
"Once you fitted , you drew in your breath at the top , and down you went at exactly the right speed , while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately , and so wriggled up ."
"Of course , when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them , and then nothing can be more graceful ."
"But you simply must fit , and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes : the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you , while you have to be made to fit the tree ."
"Usually it is done quite easily , as by your wearing too many garments or too few ; but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape , Peter does some things to you , and after that you fit ."
"Once you fit , great care must be taken to go on fitting , and this , as Wendy was to discover to her delight , keeps a whole family in perfect condition ."
"Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try , but John had to be altered a little ."
After a few days ' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well .
And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground ; especially Wendy .
"It consisted of one large room , as all houses should do , with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing , and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour , which were used as stools ."
"A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room , but every morning they sawed the trunk through , level with the floor ."
"By tea-time it was always about two feet high , and then they put a door on top of it , the whole thus becoming a table ; as soon as they cleared away , they sawed off the trunk again , and thus there was more room to play ."
"There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it , and across this Wendy stretched strings , made of fibre , from which she suspended her washing ."
"The bed was tilted against the wall by day , and let down at 6.30 , when it filled nearly half the room ; and all the boys except Michael slept in it , lying like sardines in a tin ."
"There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal , when all turned at once ."
"Michael should have used it also ; but Wendy would have a baby , and he was the littlest , and you know what women are , and the short and the long of it is that he was hung up in a basket ."
"It was rough and simple , and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances ."
"Saint Lucy Saturday was a busy and a happy time to Jack , for in the morning Mr. Acton came to see him , having heard the story overnight , and promised to keep Bob 's secret while giving Jack an acquittal as public as the reprimand had been ."
Then he asked for the report which Jack had bravely received the day before and put away without showing to anybody .
"`` There is one mistake here which we must rectify , '' said Mr. Acton , as he crossed out the low figures under the word `` Behavior , '' and put the much-desired 100 there ."
"`` But I did break the rule , sir , '' said Jack , though his face glowed with pleasure , for Mamma was looking on ."
`` I overlook that as I should your breaking into my house if you saw it was on fire .
"You ran to save a friend , and I wish I could tell those fellows why you were there ."
It would do them good .
"I am not going to praise you , John , but I did believe you in spite of appearances , and I am glad to have for a pupil a boy who loves his neighbor better than himself . ''"
"Then , having shaken hands heartily , Mr. Acton went away , and Jack flew off to have rejoicings with Jill , who sat up on her sofa , without knowing it , so eager was she to hear all about the call ."
"In the afternoon Jack drove his mother to the Captain 's , confiding to her on the way what a hard time he had when he went before , and how nothing but the thought of cheering Bob kept him up when he slipped and hurt his knee , and his boot sprung a leak , and the wind came up very cold , and the hill seemed an endless mountain of mud and snow ."
"Mrs. Minot had such a gentle way of putting things that she would have won over a much harder man than the strict old Captain , who heard the story with interest , and was much pleased with the boys ' efforts to keep Bob straight ."
"That young person dodged away into the barn with Jack , and only appeared at the last minute to shove a bag of chestnuts into the chaise ."
"But he got a few kind words that did him good , from Mrs. Minot and the Captain , and from that day felt himself under bonds to behave well if he would keep their confidence ."
"`` I shall give Jill the nuts ; and I wish I had something she wanted very , very much , for I do think she ought to be rewarded for getting me out of the mess , '' said Jack , as they drove happily home again ."
`` I hope to have something in a day or two that will delight her very much .
"I will say no more now , but keep my little secret and let it be a surprise to all by and by , '' answered his mother , looking as if she had not much doubt about the matter ."
`` That will be jolly .
"You are welcome to your secret , Mamma ."
I 've had enough of them for one while ; '' and Jack shrugged his broad shoulders as if a burden had been taken off .
"In the evening Ed came , and Jack was quite satisfied when he saw how pleased his friend was at what he had done ."
"`` I never meant you should take so much trouble , only be kind to Bob , '' said Ed , who did not know how strong his influence was , nor what a sweet example of quiet well-doing his own life was to all his mates ."
`` I wished to be really useful ; not just to talk about it and do nothing .
"That is n't your way , and I want to be like you , '' answered Jack , with such affectionate sincerity that Ed could not help believing him , though he modestly declined the compliment by saying , as he began to play softly , `` Better than I am , I hope ."
I do n't amount to much . ''
"`` Yes , you do !"
and if any one says you do n't I 'll shake him .
"I ca n't tell what it is , only you always look so happy and contented -- sort of sweet and shiny , '' said Jack , as he stroked the smooth brown head , rather at a loss to describe the unusually fresh and sunny expression of Ed 's face , which was always cheerful , yet had a certain thoughtfulness that made it very attractive to both young and old ."
"`` Soap makes him shiny ; I never saw such a fellow to wash and brush , '' put in Frank , as he came up with one of the pieces of music he and Ed were fond of practising together ."
`` I do n't mean that ! ''
said Jack indignantly .
"`` I wash and brush till you call me a dandy , but I do n't have the same look -- it seems to come from the inside , somehow , as if he was always jolly and clean and good in his mind , you know . ''"
"`` Born so , '' said Frank , rumbling away in the bass with a pair of hands that would have been the better for some of the above-mentioned soap , for he did not love to do much in the washing and brushing line ."
"Shoes , skirts , books , and toys lay about , and her drawers were a perfect chaos of soiled ruffles , odd gloves , old ribbons , boot lacings , and bits of paper ."
"`` Oh , my heart , what a muddle !"
"Mrs. Minot would n't think much of me if she could see that , '' said Molly , recalling how that lady once said she could judge a good deal of a little girl 's character and habits by a peep at her top drawer , and went on , with great success , to guess how each of the school-mates kept her drawer ."
"`` Come , missionary , clear up , and do n't let me find such a glory-hole again , or I 'll report you to the society , '' said Molly , tipping the whole drawer-full out upon the bed , and beguiling the tiresome job by keeping up the new play ."
"Twilight came before it was done , and a great pile of things loomed up on her table , with no visible means of repair , -- for Molly 's work-basket was full of nuts , and her thimble down a hole in the shed-floor , where the cats had dropped it in their play ."
"`` I 'll ask Bat for hooks and tape , and papa for some money to buy scissors and things , for I do n't know where mine are ."
Glad I ca n't do any more now !
Being neat is such hard work ! ''
"and Molly threw herself down on the rug beside the old wooden cradle in which Boo was blissfully rocking , with a cargo of toys aboard ."
"She watched her time , and as soon as her father had done supper , she hastened to say , before he got to his desk , -- `` Please , papa , I want a dollar to get some brass buttons and things to fix Boo 's clothes with ."
He wore a hole in his new trousers coasting down the Kembles ' steps .
And ca n't I wash him ?
"He needs it , and Miss Bat wo n't let me have a tub . ''"
"`` Certainly , child , certainly ; do what you like , only do n't keep me ."
"I must be off , or I shall miss Jackson , and he 's the man I want ; '' and , throwing down two dollars instead of one , Mr. Bemis hurried away , with a vague impression that Boo had swallowed a dozen brass buttons , and Miss Bat had been coasting somewhere in a bath-pan ; but catching Jackson was important , so he did not stop to investigate ."
"Armed with the paternal permission , Molly carried her point , and oh , what a dreadful evening poor Boo spent !"
"First , he was decoyed upstairs an hour too soon , then put in a tub by main force and sternly scrubbed , in spite of shrieks that brought Miss Bat to the locked door to condole with the sufferer , scold the scrubber , and depart , darkly prophesying croup before morning ."
"`` He always howls when he is washed ; but I shall do it , since you wo n't , and he must get used to it ."
"I will not have people tell me he 's neglected , if I can help it , '' cried Molly , working away with tears in her eyes -- for it was as hard for her as for Boo ; but she meant to be thorough for once in her life , no matter what happened ."
"When the worst was over , she coaxed him with candy and stories till the long task of combing out the curls was safely done ; then , in the clean night-gown with a blue button newly sewed on , she laid him in bed , worn out , but sweet as a rose ."
"`` Now , say your prayers , darling , and go to sleep with the nice red blanket all tucked round so you wo n't get cold , '' said Molly , rather doubtful of the effect of the wet head ."
"`` No , I wo n't !"
Going to sleep now !
"'' and Boo shut his eyes wearily , feeling that his late trials had not left him in a prayerful mood ."
"`` Then you 'll be a real little heathen , as Mrs. Pecq called you , and I do n't know what I shall do with you , '' said Molly , longing to cuddle rather than scold the little fellow , whose soul needed looking after as well as his body ."
"`` No , no ; I wo n't be a heevin !"
I do n't want to be frowed to the trockindiles .
I will say my prayers !
"oh , I will ! ''"
"and , rising in his bed , Boo did so , with the devotion of an infant Samuel , for he remembered the talk when the society was formed ."
"Molly thought her labors were over for that night , and soon went to bed , tired with her first attempts ."
"But toward morning she was wakened by the hoarse breathing of the boy , and was forced to patter away to Miss Bat 's room , humbly asking for the squills , and confessing that the prophecy had come to pass ."
His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .
And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children .
"But though Stalo was dead , his three sons were still living , and not very far off either ."
"They had gone to their mother , who was tending some reindeer on the pastures , and told her that by some magic , they knew not what , their father 's head had rolled from his body , and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her ."
The ogress said nothing .
"Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were , so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer , while she returned to the other house to bury her husband 's body ."
"Now , three days ' journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma , who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting ."
"Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures , but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away ."
"Unluckily , however , one day , when Lyma was left by herself in the hut , the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage ."
"The country was very lonely , and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her ."
"Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way , but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos ' house ."
When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty .
Loudly they cried : ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
"But no voice answered them ; and they fell to searching all about , lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them ."
"At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow , and they set out to follow it ."
"On and on they went , and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day 's journey would bring them to the Stalos ' dwelling ."
"Of course they did not dare to approach it openly , for the Stalos had the strength of giants , and besides , there were three of them ; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well ."
"` Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here , ' they said to each other ."
"But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came , and as she let down her bucket into the well , the leaves seemed to whisper ` Lyma !"
Lyma ! '
"The girl started and looked up , but could see nothing , and in a moment the voice came again ."
"` Be careful -- take no notice , fill your buckets , but listen carefully all the while , and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also . '"
"So Lyman bent over the well lower than before , and seemed busier than ever ."
"` You know , ' said her brother , ` that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel , but throws it to his dogs ."
"Now , after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire , and the broth is nearly cooked , just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot ."
"The Stalo will soon notice this , and will call you to give all the food to the dogs ; but , instead , you must bring it straight to us , as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk ."
That is all you need do for the present . '
"Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house , and did as her brothers had told her ."
"They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking , but when there was nothing left in the pot , the eldest one said : ` Listen carefully to what I have to tell you ."
"After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper , he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him ."
"You can hear him snoring a mile off , and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him , and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot ."
I do n't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person 's mind .
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you , and your own map can become intensely interesting , but catch them trying to draw a map of a child 's mind , which is not only confused , but keeps going round all the time ."
"There are zigzag lines on it , just like your temperature on a card , and these are probably roads in the island ; for the Neverland is always more or less an island , with astonishing splashes of colour here and there , and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing , and savages and lonely lairs , and gnomes who are mostly tailors , and caves through which a river runs , and princes with six elder brothers , and a hut fast going to decay , and one very small old lady with a hooked nose ."
"It would be an easy map if that were all ; but there is also first day at school , religion , fathers , the round pond , needlework , murders , hangings , verbs that take the dative , chocolate pudding day , getting into braces , say ninety-nine , three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself , and so on ; and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through , and it is all rather confusing , especially as nothing will stand still ."
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal .
"John 's , for instance , had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting , while Michael , who was very small , had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it ."
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands , Michael in a wigwam , Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together ."
"John had no friends , Michael had friends at night , Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents ; but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance , and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other 's nose , and so forth ."
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles .
"We too have been there ; we can still hear the sound of the surf , though we shall land no more ."
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact ; not large and sprawly , you know , with tedious distances between one adventure and another , but nicely crammed ."
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth , it is not in the least alarming , but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very nearly real ."
That is why there are night-lights .
"Occasionally in her travels through her children 's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand , and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter ."
"She knew of no Peter , and yet he was here and there in John and Michael 's minds , while Wendy 's began to be scrawled all over with him ."
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words , and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance ."
"` Yes , he is rather cocky , ' Wendy admitted with regret ."
Her mother had been questioning her .
"` But who is he , my pet ? '"
"` He is Peter Pan , you know , mother . '"
"At first Mrs. Darling did not know , but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies ."
"There were odd stories about him ; as that when children died he went part of the way with them , so that they should not be frightened ."
"She had believed in him at the time , but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person ."
"` Besides , ' she said to Wendy , ` he would be grown up by this time . '"
"` Oh no , he is n't grown up , ' Wendy assured her confidently , ` and he is just my size . '"
"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body ; she did n't know how she knew it , she just knew it ."
"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling , but he smiled pooh-pooh ."
"` Mark my words , ' he said , ` it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads ; just the sort of idea a dog would have ."
"Leave it alone , and it will blow over . '"
But it would not blow over ; and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock .
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them .
"For instance , they may remember to mention , a week after the event happened , that when they were in the wood they met their dead father and had a game with him ."
"O , our Crookback is a bold blade and a good warrior ; but , whether in cold blood or in hot , he will have all things done exact to his commandment ."
"If any fail or hinder , they shall die the death . ''"
"`` Now , by the saints ! ''"
"cried Richard , `` is this so ?"
And will men follow such a leader ? ''
"`` Nay , they follow him gleefully , '' replied the other ; `` for if he be exact to punish , he is most open-handed to reward ."
"And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others , he is ever liberal of his own , still in the first front of battle , still the last to sleep ."
"He will go far , will Crookback Dick o ' Gloucester ! ''"
"The young knight , if he had before been brave and vigilant , was now all the more inclined to watchfulness and courage ."
"His sudden favour , he began to perceive , had brought perils in its train ."
"And he turned from the archer , and once more scanned anxiously the market-place ."
It lay empty as before .
"`` I like not this quietude , '' he said ."
`` Doubtless they prepare us some surprise . ''
"And , as if in answer to his remark , the archers began once more to advance against the barricade , and the arrows to fall thick ."
But there was something hesitating in the attack .
"They came not on roundly , but seemed rather to await a further signal ."
"Dick looked uneasily about him , spying for a hidden danger ."
"And sure enough , about half way up the little street , a door was suddenly opened from within , and the house continued , for some seconds , and both by door and window , to disgorge a torrent of Lancastrian archers ."
"These , as they leaped down , hurriedly stood to their ranks , bent their bows , and proceeded to pour upon Dick 's rear a flight of arrows ."
"At the same time , the assailants in the market-place redoubled their shot , and began to close in stoutly upon the barricade ."
"Dick called down his whole command out of the houses , and facing them both ways , and encouraging their valour both by word and gesture , returned as best he could the double shower of shafts that fell about his post ."
"Meanwhile house after house was opened in the street , and the Lancastrians continued to pour out of the doors and leap down from the windows , shouting victory , until the number of enemies upon Dick 's rear was almost equal to the number in his face ."
"It was plain that he could hold the post no longer ; what was worse , even if he could have held it , it had now become useless ; and the whole Yorkist army lay in a posture of helplessness upon the brink of a complete disaster ."
"The men behind him formed the vital flaw in the general defence ; and it was upon these that Dick turned , charging at the head of his men ."
"So vigorous was the attack , that the Lancastrian archers gave ground and staggered , and , at last , breaking their ranks , began to crowd back into the houses from which they had so recently and so vaingloriously sallied ."
"Meanwhile the men from the market-place had swarmed across the undefended barricade , and fell on hotly upon the other side ; and Dick must once again face about , and proceed to drive them back ."
"Once again the spirit of his men prevailed ; they cleared the street in a triumphant style , but even as they did so the others issued again out of the houses , and took them , a third time , upon the rear ."
The Yorkists began to be scattered ; several times Dick found himself alone among his foes and plying his bright sword for life ; several times he was conscious of a hurt .
And meanwhile the fight swayed to and fro in the street without determinate result .
Suddenly Dick was aware of a great trumpeting about the outskirts of the town .
"The war-cry of York began to be rolled up to heaven , as by many and triumphant voices ."
"And whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a baby-sister , always take pains to write your address clearly ."
You ca n't think what a lot of babies Solomon has sent to the wrong house .
"Shelley 's boat , when opened , completely puzzled Solomon , and he took counsel of his assistants , who having walked over it twice , first with their toes pointed out , and then with their toes pointed in , decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five ."
They thought this because there was a large five printed on it .
` Preposterous ! '
"cried Solomon in a rage , and he presented it to Peter ; anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to Peter as a plaything ."
"But he did not play with his precious bank-note , for he knew what it was at once , having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy ."
"With so much money , he reflected , he could surely at last contrive to reach the Gardens , and he considered all the possible ways , and decided -LRB- wisely , I think -RRB- to choose the best way ."
"But , first , he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley 's boat ; and though they were too honest to demand it back , he saw that they were galled , and they cast such black looks at Solomon , who was rather vain of his cleverness , that he flew away to the end of the island , and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings ."
"Now Peter knew that unless Solomon was on your side , you never got anything done for you in the island , so he followed him and tried to hearten him ."
-LSB- Illustration : ` Preposterous ! '
cried Solomon in a rage -RSB- Nor was this all that Peter did to gain the powerful old fellow 's good-will .
You must know that Solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life .
"He looked forward to retiring by and by , and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy , and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking ."
"It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island , and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs , thirty-four nuts , sixteen crusts , a pen-wiper , and a boot-lace ."
"When his stocking was full , Solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency ."
Peter now gave him a pound .
He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick .
"This made Solomon his friend for ever , and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes ."
You will see presently why thrushes only were invited .
"The scheme to be put before them was really Peter 's , but Solomon did most of the talking , because he soon became irritable if other people talked ."
"He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building , and this put them into good-humour at once , as it was meant to do ; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests ."
"Other birds , said Solomon , omitted to line their nests with mud , and as a result they did not hold water ."
"Here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument ; but , unfortunately , a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited , and she squeaked out , ` We do n't build nests to hold water , but to hold eggs , ' and then the thrushes stopped cheering , and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water ."
"` Consider , ' he said at last , ` how warm the mud makes the nest . '"
"` Consider , ' cried Mrs. Finch , ` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . '"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"` Try another drink , ' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : For years he had been quietly filling his stocking -RSB- Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"` If , ' said he , ' a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . '"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol ."
"John Trelawney Postscript -- I did not tell you that Blandly , who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we do n't turn up by the end of August , had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respects a treasure ."
"Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named Arrow ."
"I have a boatswain who pipes , Livesey ; so things shall go man-o ' - war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA ."
"I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker 's account , which has never been overdrawn ."
"He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving ."
J. T. P.P.S. -- Hawkins may stay one night with his mother .
J. T .
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me .
"I was half beside myself with glee ; and if ever I despised a man , it was old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament ."
"Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure was like law among them all ."
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble .
"The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits ."
"The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling ."
"The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar ."
He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone .
"It was on seeing that boy that I understood , for the first time , my situation ."
"I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that I was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , I had my first attack of tears ."
"I am afraid I led that boy a dog 's life , for as he was new to the work , I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and I was not slow to profit by them ."
"The night passed , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road ."
"I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted , no longer quite so dear ."
"One of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope ."
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight .
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath .
"I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time ."
`` Where are we ? ''
I asked .
"`` Bristol , '' said Tom ."
`` Get down . ''
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner .
"Thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations ."
"In one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider 's ."
"He too sprang high and well , but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat ."
"Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk , but Andras only laughed and said carelessly : ` Just a little too short , bailiff ; next time you must do better than that . '"
"The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival 's scornful words , and answered quickly : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"And turning his back on his friends , he went sulkily home ."
"Andras , putting the money he had earned in his pocket , went home also ."
The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso .
"A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off ; and the bailiff , disguising himself as a Stalo , or ogre , called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras ."
"Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands , thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump ."
"He wandered on , his eyes fixed on the sands , so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock , while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves ."
"A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself , and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage ."
` Dear me !
"I may find some use for that , ' he said ; and hastened down to the sea , waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him ."
"Suddenly -- he could not have told why -- a nameless fear seized upon him , and he fled away from the shore as if for his life ."
"As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe , such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use ; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen , but the bailiff himself ."
"It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain , where the sun never set , and it was very difficult to get to sleep , Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic , and this stood him in good stead now ."
"The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer , and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles ."
Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing .
"Nothing he could see , but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain , and ever , as he listened , it drew nearer ."
"A cold shiver shook Andras , and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf ."
For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him .
A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living .
"Yes ; but not so swift as a Stalo , as Andras found out when he stopped to rest , and heard the pipe playing !"
"For a moment his heart sank , and he gave himself up for dead , till he remembered that , not far off , were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river ."
"In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water , except in dry seasons , and as the winter rains had been very heavy , he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen ."
"The next minute , if anyone had been looking that way , he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards , and by-and-by giving a great spring , which landed him in the midst of the stream ."
"But , instead of sinking to the bottom , he paused a second to steady himself , then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore ."
"He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly , so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was ."
` Ah !
"There you are , ' cried the Stalo , appearing on the opposite bank ; ` for a moment I really thought I had lost you . '"
"` No such luck , ' answered Andras , shaking his head sorrowfully ."
By this time he had taken his own shape again .
"With a cry John seized the branch of a tree , whipped the crutch out of his armpit , and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air ."
"It struck poor Tom , point foremost , and with stunning violence , right between the shoulders in the middle of his back ."
"His hands flew up , he gave a sort of gasp , and fell ."
"Whether he were injured much or little , none could ever tell ."
"Like enough , to judge from the sound , his back was broken on the spot ."
But he had no time given him to recover .
"Silver , agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch , was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body ."
"From my place of ambush , I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows ."
"I do not know what it rightly is to faint , but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist ; Silver and the birds , and the tall Spy-glass hilltop , going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear ."
"When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head ."
"Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass ."
"Everything else was unchanged , the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain , and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes ."
"But now John put his hand into his pocket , brought out a whistle , and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air ."
"I could not tell , of course , the meaning of the signal , but it instantly awoke my fears ."
More men would be coming .
I might be discovered .
"They had already slain two of the honest people ; after Tom and Alan , might not I come next ?"
"Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again , with what speed and silence I could manage , to the more open portion of the wood ."
"As I did so , I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades , and this sound of danger lent me wings ."
"As soon as I was clear of the thicket , I ran as I never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as I ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy ."
"Indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than I ?"
"When the gun fired , how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ?"
Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe 's ?
"Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ?"
"It was all over , I thought ."
"Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA ; good-bye to the squire , the doctor , and the captain !"
There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers .
"All this while , as I say , I was still running , and without taking any notice , I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions ."
"Mingled with these were a few scattered pines , some fifty , some nearer seventy , feet high ."
The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh .
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart .
"15 The Man of the Island FROM the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees ."
"There was something he wanted very much , but , though he knew he wanted it , he could not think what it was ."
"What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose , but that never struck him , so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment ."
They are reputed to know a good deal .
"There were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk , with their arms round each other 's waists , and he hopped down to address them ."
"The fairies have their tiffs with the birds , but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question , and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him ."
"Another was lolling on a garden-chair , reading a postage-stamp which some human had let fall , and when he heard Peter 's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip ."
To Peter 's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him .
"A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them ."
A milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it .
Soon the Gardens were in an uproar .
"Crowds of fairies were running this way and that , asking each other stoutly , who was afraid , lights were extinguished , doors barricaded , and from the grounds of Queen Mab 's palace came the rubadub of drums , showing that the royal guard had been called out ."
"A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk , armed with holly-leaves , with which they jog the enemy horribly in passing ."
"Peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after Lock-out Time , but he never thought for a moment that he was the human ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though that had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
"Poor little Peter Pan , he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease forever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"`` Look at your night-gown , if you do n't believe me , '' Solomon said , and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
`` How many of your toes are thumbs ? ''
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"`` Ruffle your feathers , '' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window-ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"`` I think I shall go back to mother , '' he said timidly ."
"`` Good-bye , '' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' said Dan , meekly , and looked a little scared by the serious tone of the last remarks , for he hated books , yet had evidently made up his mind to study anything she proposed ."
`` Do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it ? ''
was the next very unexpected question .
"Dan did see two tall old-fashioned ones standing on either side of the piano ; he knew them well , and had often seen nice bits of string , nails , brown paper , and such useful matters come out of the various drawers ."
He nodded and smiled .
"Mrs. Jo went on , `` Well , do n't you think those drawers would be good places to put your eggs , and stones , and shells , and lichens ? ''"
"`` Oh , splendid , but you would n't like my things ` clutterin ' round , ' as Mr. Page used to say , would you ? ''"
"cried Dan , sitting up to survey the old piece of furniture with sparkling eyes ."
"`` I like litter of that sort ; and if I did n't , I should give you the drawers , because I have a regard for children 's little treasures , and I think they should be treated respectfully ."
"Now , I am going to make a bargain with you , Dan , and I hope you will keep it honorably ."
"Here are twelve good-sized drawers , one for each month of the year , and they shall be yours as fast as you earn them , by doing the little duties that belong to you ."
"I believe in rewards of a certain kind , especially for young folks ; they help us along , and though we may begin by being good for the sake of the reward , if it is rightly used , we shall soon learn to love goodness for itself . ''"
`` Do you have 'em ? ''
"asked Dan , looking as if this was new talk for him ."
"`` Yes , indeed !"
I have n't learnt to get on without them yet .
"My rewards are not drawers , or presents , or holidays , but they are things which I like as much as you do the others ."
"The good behavior and success of my boys is one of the rewards I love best , and I work for it as I want you to work for your cabinet ."
"Do what you dislike , and do it well , and you get two rewards , one , the prize you see and hold ; the other , the satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed ."
Do you understand that ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am . ''"
"`` We all need these little helps ; so you shall try to do your lessons and your work , play kindly with all the boys , and use your holidays well ; and if you bring me a good report , or if I see and know it without words for I 'm quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall have a compartment in the drawer for your treasures ."
"See , some are already divided into four parts , and I will have the others made in the same way , a place for each week ; and when the drawer is filled with curious and pretty things , I shall be as proud of it as you are ; prouder , I think for in the pebbles , mosses , and gay butterflies , I shall see good resolutions carried out , conquered faults , and a promise well kept ."
"Shall we do this , Dan ? ''"
"The boys answered with one of the looks which said much , for it showed that he felt and understood her wish and words , although he did not know how to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness ."
"She understood the look , and seeing by the color that flushed up to his forehead that he was touched , as she wished him to be , she said no more about that side of the new plan , but pulled out the upper drawer , dusted it , and set it on two chairs before the sofa , saying briskly , `` Now , let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe place ."
"These compartments will hold a good deal , you see ."
"I 'd pin the butterflies and bugs round the sides ; they will be quite safe there , and leave room for the heavy things below ."
"I 'll give you some cotton wool , and clean paper and pins , and you can get ready for the week 's work . ''"
"`` But I ca n't go out to find any new things , '' said Dan , looking piteously at his foot ."
"`` That 's true ; never mind , we 'll let these treasures do for this week , and I dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them . ''"
"`` They do n't know the right sort ; besides , if I lay , no , lie here all the time , I ca n't work and study , and earn my drawers . ''"
"In the very article , comes Captain Hoseason with the story of your drowning ; whereupon all fell through ; with no consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell , injury to my pocket , and another blot upon your uncle 's character , which could very ill afford it ."
"And now , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you understand the whole process of these matters , and can judge for yourself to what extent I may be trusted . ''"
"Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him , and placed more scraps of Latin in his speech ; but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust ."
"Moreover , I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a doubt ; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` if I tell you my story , I must commit a friend 's life to your discretion ."
"Pass me your word it shall be sacred ; and for what touches myself , I will ask no better guarantee than just your face . ''"
He passed me his word very seriously .
"`` But , '' said he , `` these are rather alarming prolocutions ; and if there are in your story any little jostles to the law , I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer , and pass lightly . ''"
"Thereupon I told him my story from the first , he listening with his spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed , so that I sometimes feared he was asleep ."
But no such matter !
he heard every word -LRB- as I found afterward -RRB- with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as often surprised me .
"Even strange outlandish Gaelic names , heard for that time only , he remembered and would remind me of , years after ."
"Yet when I called Alan Breck in full , we had an odd scene ."
"The name of Alan had of course rung through Scotland , with the news of the Appin murder and the offer of the reward ; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer moved in his seat and opened his eyes ."
"`` I would name no unnecessary names , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ; `` above all of Highlanders , many of whom are obnoxious to the law . ''"
"`` Well , it might have been better not , '' said I , `` but since I have let it slip , I may as well continue . ''"
"`` Not at all , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
"`` I am somewhat dull of hearing , as you may have remarked ; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly ."
"We will call your friend , if you please , Mr. Thomson -- that there may be no reflections ."
"And in future , I would take some such way with any Highlander that you may have to mention -- dead or alive . ''"
"By this , I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly , and had already guessed I might be coming to the murder ."
"If he chose to play this part of ignorance , it was no matter of mine ; so I smiled , said it was no very Highland-sounding name , and consented ."
"Through all the rest of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson ; which amused me the more , as it was a piece of policy after his own heart ."
"James Stewart , in like manner , was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ; Colin Campbell passed as a Mr. Glen ; and to Cluny , when I came to that part of my tale , I gave the name of `` Mr. Jameson , a Highland chief . ''"
"It was truly the most open farce , and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it up ; but , after all , it was quite in the taste of that age , when there were two parties in the state , and quiet persons , with no very high opinions of their own , sought out every cranny to avoid offence to either ."
"`` Well , well , '' said the lawyer , when I had quite done , `` this is a great epic , a great Odyssey of yours ."
"You must tell it , sir , in a sound Latinity when your scholarship is riper ; or in English if you please , though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue ."
You have rolled much ; quae regio in terris -- what parish in Scotland -LRB- to make a homely translation -RRB- has not been filled with your wanderings ?
"You have shown , besides , a singular aptitude for getting into false positions ; and , yes , upon the whole , for behaving well in them ."
"This Mr. Thomson seems to me a gentleman of some choice qualities , though perhaps a trifle bloody-minded ."
"It would please me none the worse , if -LRB- with all his merits -RRB- he were soused in the North Sea , for the man , Mr. David , is a sore embarrassment ."
"But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him ; indubitably , he adhered to you ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail -RSB- But as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts , and then the music became sad also , and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens , though he could see them through the arch of the bridge ."
"He knew he could never be a real human again , and scarcely wanted to be one , but oh !"
"how he longed to play as other children play , and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens ."
"The birds brought him news of how boys and girls play , and wistful tears started in Peter 's eyes ."
Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across .
The reason was that he could not swim .
"He wanted to know how to swim , but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks , and they are so stupid ."
"They were quite willing to teach him , but all they could say about it was , ` You sit down on the top of the water in this way , and then you kick out like that . '"
"Peter tried it often , but always before he could kick out he sank ."
"What he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking , and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that ."
"Occasionally swans touched on the island , and he would give them all his day 's food and then ask them how they sat on the water , but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away ."
Once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens .
"A wonderful white thing , like a runaway newspaper , floated high over the island and then tumbled , rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing ."
"Peter was so frightened that he hid , but the birds told him it was only a kite , and what a kite is , and that it must have tugged its string out of a boy 's hand , and soared away ."
"After that they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite ; he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it , and I think this was pathetic and pretty , for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise -RSB- To the birds this was a very poor reason , but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the German measles , and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite ."
So six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it ; and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they .
"Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times , and always instead of thanking them he cried , ` Do it again ! '"
which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy .
"At last , with a grand design burning within his brave heart , he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail , and now a hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail , meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens ."
"But the kite broke to pieces in the air , and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island ."
After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise .
"Nevertheless , Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of Shelley 's boat , as I am now to tell you ."
-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Peter Pan ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- III THE THRUSH 'S NEST Shelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to be .
He was a poet ; and they are never exactly grown-up .
"They are people who despise money except what you need for to-day , and he had all that and five pounds over ."
"So , when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens , he made a paper boat of his bank-note , and sent it sailing on the Serpentine ."
"It reached the island at night ; and the look-out brought it to Solomon Caw , who thought at first that it was the usual thing , a message from a lady , saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one ."
"They always ask for the best one he has , and if he likes the letter he sends one from Class A , but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed ."
"Sometimes he sends none at all , and at another time he sends a nestful ; it all depends on the mood you catch him in ."
"He likes you to leave it all to him , and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time , he is almost sure to send another girl ."
"There was no sign of the brig , which must have lifted from the reef and sunk ."
"The boat , too , was nowhere to be seen ."
There was never a sail upon the ocean ; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man .
"I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates , and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene ."
"What with my wet clothes and weariness , and my belly that now began to ache with hunger , I had enough to trouble me without that ."
"So I set off eastward along the south coast , hoping to find a house where I might warm myself , and perhaps get news of those I had lost ."
"And at the worst , I considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes ."
"After a little , my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea , which seemed to run pretty deep into the land ; and as I had no means to get across , I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it ."
"It was still the roughest kind of walking ; indeed the whole , not only of Earraid , but of the neighbouring part of Mull -LRB- which they call the Ross -RRB- is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among ."
At first the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see ; but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again .
"At this I scratched my head , but had still no notion of the truth : until at last I came to a rising ground , and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a little barren isle , and cut off on every side by the salt seas ."
"Instead of the sun rising to dry me , it came on to rain , with a thick mist ; so that my case was lamentable ."
"I stood in the rain , and shivered , and wondered what to do , till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable ."
Back I went to the narrowest point and waded in .
"But not three yards from shore , I plumped in head over ears ; and if ever I was heard of more , it was rather by God 's grace than my own prudence ."
"I was no wetter -LRB- for that could hardly be -RRB- , but I was all the colder for this mishap ; and having lost another hope was the more unhappy ."
"And now , all at once , the yard came in my head ."
What had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety .
"With that I set off , undaunted , across the top of the isle , to fetch and carry it back ."
"It was a weary tramp in all ways , and if hope had not buoyed me up , I must have cast myself down and given up ."
"Whether with the sea salt , or because I was growing fevered , I was distressed with thirst , and had to stop , as I went , and drink the peaty water out of the hags ."
"I came to the bay at last , more dead than alive ; and at the first glance , I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left it ."
"In I went , for the third time , into the sea ."
"The sand was smooth and firm , and shelved gradually down , so that I could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face ."
"But at that depth my feet began to leave me , and I durst venture in no farther ."
"As for the yard , I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond ."
"I had borne up well until this last disappointment ; but at that I came ashore , and flung myself down upon the sands and wept ."
"The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me , that I must pass it lightly over ."
"In all the books I have read of people cast away , they had either their pockets full of tools , or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them , as if on purpose ."
My case was very different .
"I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan 's silver button ; and being inland bred , I was as much short of knowledge as of means ."
"I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat ; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets , which at first I could scarcely strike from their places , not knowing quickness to be needful ."
"But she often talked lovingly of Peter , and she knitted a kettle-holder for him , and one day when she was wondering what Easter present he would like , her mother made a suggestion ."
"-LSB- Illustration : If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ` Nothing , ' she said thoughtfully , ` would be so useful to him as a goat . '"
"` He could ride on it , ' cried Maimie , ` and play on his pipe at the same time . '"
"` Then , ' her mother asked , ` wo n't you give him your goat , the one you frighten Tony with at night ? '"
"` But it is n't a real goat , ' Maimie said ."
"` It seems very real to Tony , ' replied her mother ."
"` It seems frightfully real to me too , ' Maimie admitted , ` but how could I give it to Peter ? '"
"Her mother knew a way , and next day , accompanied by Tony -LRB- who was really quite a nice boy , though of course he could not compare -RRB- , they went to the Gardens , and Maimie stood alone within a fairy ring , and then her mother , who was a rather gifted lady , said -- ` My daughter , tell me , if you can , What have you got for Peter Pan ? '"
"To which Maimie replied -- ' I have a goat for him to ride , Observe me cast it far and wide . '"
"She then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed , and turned round three times ."
"Next Tony said -- ` If P. doth find it waiting here , Wilt ne'er again make me to fear ? '"
And Maimie answered -- ` By dark or light I fondly swear Never to see goats anywhere . '
"She also left a letter to Peter in a likely place , explaining what she had done , and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one convenient for riding on ."
"Well , it all happened just as she hoped , for Peter found the letter , and of course nothing could be easier for the fairies than to turn the goat into a real one , and so that is how Peter got the goat on which he now rides round the Gardens every night playing sublimely on his pipe ."
"And Maimie kept her promise , and never frightened Tony with a goat again , though I have heard that she created another animal ."
"Until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave presents for Peter in the Gardens -LRB- with letters explaining how humans play with them -RRB- , and she is not the only one who has done this ."
"David does it , for instance , and he and I know the likeliest place for leaving them in , and we shall tell you if you like , but for mercy 's sake do n't ask us before Porthos , for he is so fond of toys that , were he to find out the place , he would take every one of them ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They will certainly mischief you -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- Though Peter still remembers Maimie he is become as gay as ever , and often in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily on the grass ."
"Oh , he has a joyful time !"
"But he has still a vague memory that he was a human once , and it makes him especially kind to the house-swallows when they visit the island , for house-swallows are the spirits of little children who have died ."
"They always build in the eaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans , and sometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window , and perhaps that is why Peter loves them best of all the birds ."
And the little house ?
"Every lawful night -LRB- that is to say , every night except ball nights -RRB- the fairies now build the little house lest there should be a human child lost in the Gardens , and Peter rides the marches looking for lost ones , and if he finds them he carries them on his goat to the little house , and when they wake up they are in it , and when they step out they see it ."
"The fairies build the house merely because it is so pretty , but Peter rides round in memory of Maimie , and because he still loves to do just as he believes real boys would do ."
"But you must not think that , because somewhere among the trees the little house is twinkling , it is a safe thing to remain in the Gardens after Lock-out time ."
"If the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out that night they will certainly mischief you , and even though they are not , you may perish of cold and dark before Peter Pan comes round ."
"He has been too late several times , and when he sees he is too late he runs back to the Thrush 's Nest for his paddle , of which Maimie had told him the true use , and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little tombstone , and carves the poor thing 's initials on it ."
"He does this at once because he thinks it is what real boys would do , and you must have noticed the little stones , and that there are always two together ."
He puts them in twos because they seem less lonely .
I think that quite the most touching sight in the Gardens is the two tombstones of Walter Stephen Matthews and Phoebe Phelps .
They stand together at the spot where the parish of Westminster St. Mary 's is said to meet the parish of Paddington .
"Here Peter found the two babes , who had fallen unnoticed from their perambulators , Phoebe aged thirteen months and Walter probably still younger , for Peter seems to have felt a delicacy about putting any age on his stone ."
"`` You 're pretty stubborn , I reckon , '' was Mr. Harrison 's way of putting it ."
"`` Well , well , we 'll see ."
Someday when you get riled up ... and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled ... you 'll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling .

"Altogether , Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood ."
She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea .
"Anne sipped it patiently , although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do ."
"Had it been some magic brew , potent to confer age and experience , Anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching ."
"`` Marilla , what if I fail ! ''"
"`` You 'll hardly fail completely in one day and there 's plenty more days coming , '' said Marilla ."
"`` The trouble with you , Anne , is that you 'll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off , and if you ca n't you 'll think you 've failed . ''"
V A Full-fledged Schoolma'am When Anne reached the school that morning ... for the first time in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties ... all was quiet and still .
"The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival , and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of `` shining morning faces '' and bright , inquisitive eyes ."
"She hung up her hat and faced her pupils , hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling ."
She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school .
"She had revised and improved it painstakingly , and then she had learned it off by heart ."
"It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it , especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge ."
The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it .
"After what seemed to her a year ... about ten seconds in reality ... she said faintly , `` Take your Testaments , please , '' and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed ."
While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land .
"Most of them were , of course , quite well known to her ."
"Her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her , excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to Avonlea ."
Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her .
"To be sure , they might be just as commonplace as the rest ; but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among them ."
It was a thrilling idea .
Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye .
"He had a dark , sullen little face , and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes ."
Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boy 's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly .
"In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane ... a jolly looking little chap , with a snub nose , freckled face , and big , light blue eyes , fringed with whitish lashes ... probably the DonNELL boy ; and if resemblance went for anything , his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell ."
"Anne wondered what sort of mother the child had , to send her to school dressed as she was ."
"She wore a faded pink silk dress , trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace , soiled white kid slippers , and silk stockings ."
"Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls , surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head ."
`` But I will be cruelly avenged .
"I will tell a secret to my Lady Shelton -- she that is to be , '' she added , curtseying ."
"`` Joanna , '' she continued , `` I believe , upon my soul , your sweetheart is a bold fellow in a fight , but he is , let me tell you plainly , the softest-hearted simpleton in England ."
Go to -- ye may do your pleasure with him !
"And now , fool children , first kiss me , either one of you , for luck and kindness ; and then kiss each other just one minute by the glass , and not one second longer ; and then let us all three set forth for Holywood as fast as we can stir ; for these woods , methinks , are full of peril and exceeding cold . ''"
`` But did my Dick make love to you ? ''
"asked Joanna , clinging to her sweetheart 's side ."
"`` Nay , fool girl , '' returned Alicia ; `` it was I made love to him ."
"I offered to marry him , indeed ; but he bade me go marry with my likes ."
These were his words .
"Nay , that I will say : he is more plain than pleasant ."
"But now , children , for the sake of sense , set forward ."
"Shall we go once more over the dingle , or push straight for Holywood ? ''"
"`` Why , '' said Dick , `` I would like dearly to get upon a horse ; for I have been sore mauled and beaten , one way and another , these last days , and my poor body is one bruise ."
But how think ye ?
"If the men , upon the alarm of the fighting , had fled away , we should have gone about for nothing ."
"'T is but some three short miles to Holywood direct ; the bell hath not beat nine ; the snow is pretty firm to walk upon , the moon clear ; how if we went even as we are ? ''"
"`` Agreed , '' cried Alicia ; but Joanna only pressed upon Dick 's arm ."
"Forth , then , they went , through open leafless groves and down snow-clad alleys , under the white face of the winter moon ; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure ; and their light-minded companion , her own bereavements heartily forgotten , followed a pace or two behind , now rallying them upon their silence , and now drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives ."
"Still , indeed , in the distance of the wood , the riders of Tunstall might be heard urging their pursuit ; and from time to time cries or the clash of steel announced the shock of enemies ."
"But in these young folk , bred among the alarms of war , and fresh from such a multiplicity of dangers , neither fear nor pity could be lightly wakened ."
"Content to find the sounds still drawing farther and farther away , they gave up their hearts to the enjoyment of the hour , walking already , as Alicia put it , in a wedding procession ; and neither the rude solitude of the forest , nor the cold of the freezing night , had any force to shadow or distract their happiness ."
"At length , from a rising hill , they looked below them on the dell of Holywood ."
"The great windows of the forest abbey shone with torch and candle ; its high pinnacles and spires arose very clear and silent , and the gold rood upon the topmost summit glittered brightly in the moon ."
"All about it , in the open glade , camp-fires were burning , and the ground was thick with huts ; and across the midst of the picture the frozen river curved ."
"`` By the mass , '' said Richard , `` there are Lord Foxham 's fellows still encamped ."
The messenger hath certainly miscarried .
"Well , then , so better ."
We have power at hand to face Sir Daniel . ''
"But if Lord Foxham 's men still lay encamped in the long holm at Holywood , it was from a different reason from the one supposed by Dick ."
"They had marched , indeed , for Shoreby ; but ere they were half way thither , a second messenger met them , and bade them return to their morning 's camp , to bar the road against Lancastrian fugitives , and to be so much nearer to the main army of York ."
"For Richard of Gloucester , having finished the battle and stamped out his foes in that district , was already on the march to rejoin his brother ; and not long after the return of my Lord Foxham 's retainers , Crookback himself drew rein before the abbey door ."
"He came nigh-hand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry ."
Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us . ''
"I told my plan to the captain , and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment ."
"We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle , with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection ."
"Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port , and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins , muskets , bags of biscuits , kegs of pork , a cask of cognac , and my invaluable medicine chest ."
"In the meantime , the squire and the captain stayed on deck , and the latter hailed the coxswain , who was the principal man aboard ."
"`` Mr. Hands , '' he said , `` here are two of us with a brace of pistols each ."
"If any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man 's dead . ''"
"They were a good deal taken aback , and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion , thinking no doubt to take us on the rear ."
"But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley , they went about ship at once , and a head popped out again on deck ."
"`` Down , dog ! ''"
cries the captain .
"And the head popped back again ; and we heard no more , for the time , of these six very faint-hearted seamen ."
"By this time , tumbling things in as they came , we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared ."
"Joyce and I got out through the stern-port , and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us ."
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore .
"`` Lillibullero '' was dropped again ; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point , one of them whipped ashore and disappeared ."
"I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats , but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand , and all might very well be lost by trying for too much ."
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house .
"All three made the first journey , heavily laden , and tossed our stores over the palisade ."
"Then , leaving Joyce to guard them -- one man , to be sure , but with half a dozen muskets -- Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more ."
"So we proceeded without pausing to take breath , till the whole cargo was bestowed , when the two servants took up their position in the block house , and I , with all my power , sculled back to the HISPANIOLA ."
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was .
"They had the advantage of numbers , of course , but we had the advantage of arms ."
"Not one of the men ashore had a musket , and before they could get within range for pistol shooting , we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least ."
"The squire was waiting for me at the stern window , all his faintness gone from him ."
"He caught the painter and made it fast , and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives ."
"Pork , powder , and biscuit was the cargo , with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain ."
"The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water , so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun , on the clean , sandy bottom ."
"By this time the tide was beginning to ebb , and the ship was swinging round to her anchor ."
"Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs ; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter , who were well to the eastward , it warned our party to be off ."
"Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat , which we then brought round to the ship 's counter , to be handier for Captain Smollett ."
"Borrowing a rope for a halter , Dan led her home , followed by a party of very sober young gentlemen , for the cow was in a sad state , having strained her shoulder jumping , so that she limped , her eyes looked wild , and her glossy coat was wet and muddy ."
"`` You 'll catch it this time , Dan , '' said Tommy , as he led the wheezing donkey beside the maltreated cow ."
"`` So will you , for you helped . ''"
"`` We all did , but Demi , '' added Jack ."
"`` He put it into our heads , '' said Ned ."
"`` I told you not to do it , '' cried Demi , who was most broken-hearted at poor Buttercup 's state ."
"`` Old Bhaer will send me off , I guess ."
"Do n't care if he does , '' muttered Dan , looking worried in spite of his words ."
"`` We 'll ask him not to , all of us , '' said Demi , and the others assented with the exception of Stuffy , who cherished the hope that all the punishment might fall on one guilty head ."
"Dan only said , `` Do n't bother about me ; '' but he never forgot it , even though he led the lads astray again , as soon as the temptation came ."
"When Mr. Bhaer saw the animal , and heard the story , he said very little , evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of impatience ."
"Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall , and the boys sent to their rooms till supper-time ."
"This brief respite gave them time to think the matter over , to wonder what the penalty would be , and to try to imagine where Dan would be sent ."
"He whistled briskly in his room , so that no one should think he cared a bit ; but while he waited to know his fate , the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger , the more he recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here , the hardship and neglect he had felt elsewhere ."
"He knew they tried to help him , and at the bottom of his heart he was grateful , but his rough life had made him hard and careless , suspicious and wilful ."
"He hated restraint of any sort , and fought against it like an untamed creature , even while he knew it was kindly meant , and dimly felt that he would be the better for it ."
"He made up his mind to be turned adrift again , to knock about the city as he had done nearly all his life ; a prospect that made him knit his black brows , and look about the cosy little room with a wistful expression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr. Bhaer 's if he had seen it ."
"It vanished instantly , however , when the good man came in , and said in his accustomed grave way , `` I have heard all about it , Dan , and though you have broken the rules again , I am going to give you one more trial , to please Mother Bhaer . ''"
"Dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve , but he only said in his gruff way , `` I did n't know there was any rule about bull-fighting . ''"
"`` As I never expected to have any at Plumfield , I never did make such a rule , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , smiling in spite of himself at the boy 's excuse ."
"Then he added gravely , `` But one of the first and most important of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the place ."
"I want everybody and everything to be happy here , to love and trust , and serve us , as we try to love and trust and serve them faithfully and willingly ."
"I have often said that you were kinder to the animals than any of the other boys , and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in you very much , because she thought it showed a good heart ."
"But you have disappointed us in that , and we are sorry , for we hoped to make you quite one of us ."
Shall we try again ? ''
"Dan 's eyes had been on the floor , and his hands nervously picking at the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in , but when he heard the kind voice ask that question , he looked up quickly , and said in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before , `` Yes , please . ''"
"`` Very well , then , we will say no more , only you will stay at home from the walk to-morrow , as the other boys will and all of you must wait on poor Buttercup till she is well again . ''"
`` I will . ''
"`` Now , go down to supper , and do your best , my boy , more for your own sake than for ours . ''"
"Then Mr. Bhaer shook hands with him , and Dan went down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping which Asia had strongly recommended ."
"Dan did try for a day or two , but not being used to it , he soon tired and relapsed into his old wilful ways ."
"Mr. Bhaer was called from home on business one day , and the boys had no lessons ."
"The room was nearly dark , for the lantern burned badly ; they could not laugh loud nor move about much , for Silas slept next door in the shed-chamber , and altogether the party was dull ."
"In the middle of a deal Dan stopped suddenly , and called out , `` Who 's that ? ''"
"in a startled tone , and at the same moment drew the slide over the light ."
"A voice in the darkness said tremulously , `` I ca n't find Tommy , '' and then there was the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from the wing to the main house ."
`` It 's Demi !
"he 's gone to call some one ; cut into bed , Tom , and do n't tell ! ''"
"cried Dan , whisking all signs of the revel out of sight , and beginning to tear off his clothes , while Nat did the same ."
"Tommy flew to his room and dived into bed , where he lay , laughing till something burned his hand , when he discovered that he was still clutching the stump of the festive cigar , which he happened to be smoking when the revel broke up ."
"It was nearly out , and he was about to extinguish it carefully when Nursey 's voice was heard , and fearing it would betray him if he hid it in the bed , he threw it underneath , after a final pinch which he thought finished it ."
"Nursey came in with Demi , who looked much amazed to see the red face of Tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow ."
"`` He was n't there just now , because I woke up and could not find him anywhere , '' said Demi , pouncing on him ."
"`` What mischief are you at now , bad child ? ''"
"asked Nursey , with a good-natured shake , which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly , `` I only ran into Nat 's room to see him about something ."
"Go away , and let me alone ; I 'm awful sleepy . ''"
"Nursey tucked Demi in , and went off to reconnoitre , but only found two boys slumbering peacefully in Dan 's room ."
"`` Some little frolic , '' she thought , and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer , who was busy and worried over little Teddy ."
"Tommy was sleepy , and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask questions , he was snoring in ten minutes , little dreaming what was going on under his bed ."
"The cigar did not go out , but smouldered away on the straw carpet till it was nicely on fire , and a hungry little flame went creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught , then the sheets , and then the bed itself ."
"The beer made Tommy sleep heavily , and the smoke stupified Demi , so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them , and they were in danger of being burned to death ."
"Franz was sitting up to study , and as he left the school-room he smelt the smoke , dashed up-stairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left wing of the house ."
"Without stopping to call any one , he ran into the room , dragged the boys from the blazing bed , and splashed all the water he could find at hand on to the flames ."
"It checked but did not quench the fire , and the children wakened on being tumbled topsy-turvy into a cold hall , began to roar at the top of their voices ."
"Mrs. Bhaer instantly appeared , and a minute after Silas burst out of his room shouting , `` Fire ! ''"
in a tone that raised the whole house .
"A flock of white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall , and for a minute every one was panic-stricken ."
"Then Mrs. Bhaer found her wits , bade Nursey see to the burnt boys , and sent Franz and Silas down-stairs for some tubs of wet clothes which she flung on the bed , over the carpet , and up against the curtains , now burning finely , and threatening to kindle the walls ."
"Most of the boys stood dumbly looking on , but Dan and Emil worked bravely , running to and fro with water from the bath-room , and helping to pull down the dangerous curtains ."
"The peril was soon over , and ordering the boys all back to bed , and leaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again , Mrs. Bhaer and Franz went to see how the poor boys got on ."
"Demi had escaped with one burn and a grand scare , but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched off his head , but a great burn on his arm , that made him half crazy with the pain ."
"Demi was soon made cosy , and Franz took him away to his own bed , where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as cosily as a woman ."
"Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night , trying to ease his misery , and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy with oil and cotton , paregoric and squills , saying to herself from time to time , as if she found great amusement in the thought , `` I always knew Tommy would set the house on fire , and now he has done it ! ''"
When Mr. Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things .
"A dense forest lay all round the cottage , and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood ."
"In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare , and many an hour the two passed together , when the man was resting by the roadside , eating his dinner ."
"Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki , a wicked , quarrelsome beast , who hated the peasant , and was never tired of doing him an ill turn ."
"Again and again he had crept to the hut , and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare , had either eaten it if he thought it nice , or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it , and at last the peasant lost patience , and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki 's blood ."
"So for many days the man lay hidden , waiting for the Tanuki to come by , and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal , the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly , so that he could not move ."
"Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house , feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns ."
"` He shall pay for them with his skin , ' he said to his wife ."
"` We will first kill him , and then cook him . '"
"So saying , he hanged the Tanuki , head downwards , to a beam , and went out to gather wood for a fire ."
Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight .
"Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner , and , stopping her work , she looked round to see what it was ."
"That was all that the rascal wanted , and he put on directly his most humble air , and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds , which her hurting him sorely ."
"She was filled with pity for him , but did not dare to set him free , as she knew that her husband would be very angry ."
"The Tanuki , however , did not despair , and seeing that her heart was softened , began his prayers anew ."
"` He only asked to have his bonds taken from him , ' he said ."
"` He would give his word not to attempt to escape , and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her . '"
"` Then you can have a little rest , ' he went on , ` for rice pounding is very tiring work , and not at all fit for weak women . '"
"These last words melted the good woman completely , and she unfastened the bonds that held him ."
Poor foolish creature !
"In one moment the Tanuki had seized her , stripped off all her clothes , and popped her in the mortar ."
"In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice ; and not content with that , the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife !"
"When everything was complete he looked out of the door , and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood ."
"Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman 's clothes , but , as he was a magician , assumed her form as well ."
"Then he took the wood , kindled the fire , and very soon set a large dinner before the old man , who was very hungry , and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy ."
"But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner , he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape ."
"Then he said to the peasant , ` You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them !"
You are caught in your own net .
"It is your own wife that you have eaten , and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor . '"
With these words he turned and made for the forest .
"The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened , and seemed frozen to the place where he stood ."
"When he had recovered himself a little , he collected the bones of his dead wife , buried them in the garden , and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki ."
"After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly , and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife ."
On every side the company of the Black Arrow was making for the hill .
"Some , being better runners , or having open ground to run upon , had far outstripped the others , and were already close upon the goal ; some , following valleys , had spread out to right and left , and outflanked the lads on either side ."
Dick plunged into the nearest cover .
"It was a tall grove of oaks , firm under foot and clear of underbrush , and as it lay down hill , they made good speed ."
"There followed next a piece of open , which Dick avoided , holding to his left ."
"Two minutes after , and the same obstacle arising , the lads followed the same course ."
"Thus it followed that , while the lads , bending continually to the left , drew nearer and nearer to the high road and the river which they had crossed an hour or two before , the great bulk of their pursuers were leaning to the other hand , and running towards Tunstall ."
The lads paused to breathe .
There was no sound of pursuit .
"Dick put his ear to the ground , and still there was nothing ; but the wind , to be sure , still made a turmoil in the trees , and it was hard to make certain ."
"`` On again , '' said Dick ; and , tired as they were , and Matcham limping with his injured foot , they pulled themselves together , and once more pelted down the hill ."
"Three minutes later , they were breasting through a low thicket of evergreen ."
"High overhead , the tall trees made a continuous roof of foliage ."
"It was a pillared grove , as high as a cathedral , and except for the hollies among which the lads were struggling , open and smoothly swarded ."
"On the other side , pushing through the last fringe of evergreen , they blundered forth again into the open twilight of the grove ."
`` Stand ! ''
cried a voice .
"And there , between the huge stems , not fifty feet before them , they beheld a stout fellow in green , sore blown with running , who instantly drew an arrow to the head and covered them ."
"Matcham stopped with a cry ; but Dick , without a pause , ran straight upon the forester , drawing his dagger as he went ."
"The other , whether he was startled by the daring of the onslaught , or whether he was hampered by his orders , did not shoot ; he stood wavering ; and before he had time to come to himself , Dick bounded at his throat , and sent him sprawling backward on the turf ."
The arrow went one way and the bow another with a sounding twang .
The disarmed forester grappled his assailant ; but the dagger shone and descended twice .
"Then came a couple of groans , and then Dick rose to his feet again , and the man lay motionless , stabbed to the heart ."
`` On ! ''
"said Dick ; and he once more pelted forward , Matcham trailing in the rear ."
"To say truth , they made but poor speed of it by now , labouring dismally as they ran , and catching for their breath like fish ."
"Matcham had a cruel stitch , and his head swam ; and as for Dick , his knees were like lead ."
But they kept up the form of running with undiminished courage .
Presently they came to the end of the grove .
"It stopped abruptly ; and there , a few yards before them , was the high road from Risingham to Shoreby , lying , at this point , between two even walls of forest ."
"At the sight Dick paused ; and as soon as he stopped running , he became aware of a confused noise , which rapidly grew louder ."
"It was at first like the rush of a very high gust of wind , but soon it became more definite , and resolved itself into the galloping of horses ; and then , in a flash , a whole company of men-at-arms came driving round the corner , swept before the lads , and were gone again upon the instant ."
"`` In honour , I do , '' said Dick ."
"`` Hear , then , '' she continued ; `` Ye would make but a sad friar , methinks ; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure , I will even take you for my husband ."
"Nay , now , no words ! ''"
cried she .
`` They will avail you nothing .
"For see how just it is , that you who deprived me of one home , should supply me with another ."
"And as for Joanna , she will be the first , believe me , to commend the change ; for , after all , as we be dear friends , what matters it with which of us ye wed ?"
Not one whit ! ''
"`` Madam , '' said Dick , `` I will go into a cloister , an ye please to bid me ; but to wed with anyone in this big world besides Joanna Sedley is what I will consent to neither for man 's force nor yet for lady 's pleasure ."
"Pardon me if I speak my plain thoughts plainly ; but where a maid is very bold , a poor man must even be the bolder . ''"
"`` Dick , '' she said , `` ye sweet boy , ye must come and kiss me for that word ."
"Nay , fear not , ye shall kiss me for Joanna ; and when we meet , I shall give it back to her , and say I stole it ."
"And as for what ye owe me , why , dear simpleton , methinks ye were not alone in that great battle ; and even if York be on the throne , it was not you that set him there ."
"But for a good , sweet , honest heart , Dick , y ' are all that ; and if I could find it in my soul to envy your Joanna anything , I would even envy her your love . ''"
"CHAPTER VI -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS -LRB- concluded -RRB- : DICK AND JOAN The horses had by this time finished the small store of provender , and fully breathed from their fatigues ."
"At Dick 's command , the fire was smothered in snow ; and while his men got once more wearily to saddle , he himself , remembering , somewhat late , true woodland caution , chose a tall oak and nimbly clambered to the topmost fork ."
Hence he could look far abroad on the moonlit and snow-paven forest .
"On the south-west , dark against the horizon , stood those upland , heathy quarters where he and Joanna had met with the terrifying misadventure of the leper ."
And there his eye was caught by a spot of ruddy brightness no bigger than a needle 's eye .
He blamed himself sharply for his previous neglect .
"Were that , as it appeared to be , the shining of Sir Daniel 's camp-fire , he should long ago have seen and marched for it ; above all , he should , for no consideration , have announced his neighbourhood by lighting a fire of his own ."
But now he must no longer squander valuable hours .
"The direct way to the uplands was about two miles in length ; but it was crossed by a very deep , precipitous dingle , impassable to mounted men ; and for the sake of speed , it seemed to Dick advisable to desert the horses and attempt the adventure on foot ."
"Ten men were left to guard the horses ; signals were agreed upon by which they could communicate in case of need ; and Dick set forth at the head of the remainder , Alicia Risingham walking stoutly by his side ."
"The men had freed themselves of heavy armour , and left behind their lances ; and they now marched with a very good spirit in the frozen snow , and under the exhilarating lustre of the moon ."
"The descent into the dingle , where a stream strained sobbing through the snow and ice , was effected with silence and order ; and on the further side , being then within a short half mile of where Dick had seen the glimmer of the fire , the party halted to breathe before the attack ."
"In the vast silence of the wood , the lightest sounds were audible from far ; and Alicia , who was keen of hearing , held up her finger warningly and stooped to listen ."
"All followed her example ; but besides the groans of the choked brook in the dingle close behind , and the barking of a fox at a distance of many miles among the forest , to Dick 's acutest hearkening , not a breath was audible ."
"`` But yet , for sure , I heard the clash of harness , '' whispered Alicia ."
"`` Madam , '' returned Dick , who was more afraid of that young lady than of ten stout warriors , `` I would not hint ye were mistaken ; but it might well have come from either of the camps . ''"
`` It came not thence .
"It came from westward , '' she declared ."
"You must know that , while Lucy was busy for others , she was not forgotten , and when she was expecting to lie on her bed through the summer , plans were being made for all sorts of pleasant changes ."
"First of all , she was to have a nice little brace to support the back which was growing better every day ; then , as the warm weather came on , she was to go out , or lie on the piazza ; and by and by , when school was done , she was to go with the queen and the princes for a month or two down to the sea-side , where fresh air and salt water were to build her up in the most delightful way ."
"There , now !"
is n't that the best ending of all ? ''
"and Mamma paused to read her answer in the bright faces of two of the listeners , for Jill hid hers in the pillow , and lay quite still , as if it was too much for her ."
`` That will be regularly splendid !
"I 'll row you all about -- boating is so much easier than riding , and I like it on salt water , '' said Frank , going to sit on the arm of the sofa , quite excited by the charms of the new plan ."
"`` And I 'll teach you to swim , and roll you over the beach , and get sea-weed and shells , and no end of nice things , and we 'll all come home as strong as lions , '' added Jack , scrambling up as if about to set off at once ."
"`` The doctor says you have been doing finely of late , and the brace will come to-morrow , and the first really mild day you are to have a breath of fresh air ."
Wo n't that be good ? ''
"asked Mrs. Minot , hoping her story had not been too interesting ."
`` Is she crying ? ''
"said Jack , much concerned as he patted the pillow in his most soothing way , while Frank lifted one curl after another to see what was hidden underneath ."
"Not tears , for two eyes sparkled behind the fingers , then the hands came down like clouds from before the sun , and Jill 's face shone out so bright and happy it did one 's heart good to see it ."
"`` I 'm not crying , '' she said with a laugh which was fuller of blithe music than any song she sung ."
"`` But it was so splendid , it sort of took my breath away for a minute ."
"I thought I was n't any better , and never should be , and I made up my mind I would n't ask , it would be so hard for any one to tell me so ."
"Now I see why the doctor made me stand up , and told me to get my baskets ready to go a-Maying ."
I thought he was in fun ; did he really mean I could go ? ''
"asked Jill , expecting too much , for a word of encouragement made her as hopeful as she had been despondent before ."
"`` No , dear , not so soon as that ."
"It will be months , probably , before you can walk and run , as you used to ; but they will soon pass ."
"You need n't mind about May-day ; it is always too cold for flowers , and you will find more here among your own plants , than on the hills , to fill your baskets , '' answered Mrs. Minot , hastening to suggest something pleasant to beguile the time of probation ."
`` I can wait .
"Months are not years , and if I 'm truly getting well , everything will seem beautiful and easy to me , '' said Jill , laying herself down again , with the patient look she had learned to wear , and gathering up the scattered carnations to enjoy their spicy breath , as if the fairies hidden there had taught her some of their sweet secrets ."
"`` Dear little girl , it has been a long , hard trial for you , but it is coming to an end , and I think you will find that it has not been time wasted , I do n't want you to be a saint quite yet , but I am sure a gentler Jill will rise up from that sofa than the one who lay down there in December . ''"
"`` How could I help growing better , when you were so good to me ? ''"
"cried Jill , putting up both arms , as Mrs. Minot went to take Frank 's place , and he retired to the fire , there to stand surveying the scene with calm approval ."
`` You have done quite as much for us ; so we are even .
"I proved that to your mother , and she is going to let the little house and take care of the big one for me , while I borrow you to keep me happy and make the boys gentle and kind ."
"That is the bargain , and we get the best of it , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking well pleased , while Jack added , `` That 's so ! ''"
"and Frank observed with an air of conviction , `` We could n't get on without Jill , possibly . ''"
"From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all , and screamed with all her might , hoping that some one would hear , and come to help ."
"Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by , and he drove off the dog , and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms , carried him to his mistress ."
"So poor little Koma was left alone , while Gon was borne away full of trouble , not in the least knowing what to do ."
"Even the attention paid him by the princess , who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways , did not console him , but there was no use in fighting against fate , and he could only wait and see what would turn up ."
"The princess , Gon 's new mistress , was so good and kind that everybody loved her , and she would have led a happy life , had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her , and was constantly annoying her by his presence ."
"Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared ; but as they were careless , and the serpent very sly , it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them , and to frighten the princess by appearing before her ."
"One day she was seated in her room , playing on her favourite musical instrument , when she felt something gliding up her sash , and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek ."
"She shrieked and threw herself backwards , and Gon , who had been curled up on a stool at her feet , understood her terror , and with one bound seized the snake by his neck ."
"He gave him one bite and one shake , and flung him on the ground , where he lay , never to worry the princess any more ."
"Then she took Gon in her arms , and praised and caressed him , and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat , and the softest mats to lie on ; and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again ."
"Time passed on , and one morning Gon lay before the house door , basking in the sun ."
"He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him , and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and ill-treating quite a little one ."
"He jumped up , full of rage , and chased away the big cat , and then he turned to comfort the little one , when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma ."
"At first Koma did not know him again , he had grown so large and stately ; but when it dawned upon her who it was , her happiness knew no bounds ."
"And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again , while their purring might have been heard a mile off ."
"Paw in paw they appeared before the princess , and told her the story of their life and its sorrows ."
"The princess wept for sympathy , and promised that they should never more be parted , but should live with her to the end of their days ."
"By-and-bye the princess herself got married , and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park ."
"And she told him all about her two cats , and how brave Gon had been , and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent ."
"And when the prince heard , he swore they should never leave them , but should go with the princess wherever she went ."
"So it all fell out as the princess wished ; and Gon and Koma had many children , and so had the princess , and they all played together , and were friends to the end of their lives ."

"Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not get on at all well together , for the younger was much handsomer than his elder brother who was very jealous of him ."
"When they grew older , things became worse and worse , and at last one day as they were walking through a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other , tied him to a tree , and went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death ."
"However , it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree with his flock , and seeing the prisoner , he stopped and said to him , ` Tell me , my son why are you tied to that tree ? '"
"` Because I was so crooked , ' answered the young man ; ` but it has quite cured me , and now my back is as straight as can be . ' '"
"I wish you would bind me to a tree , ' exclaimed the shepherd , ` so that my back would get straight . '"
"` With all the pleasure in life , ' replied the youth ."
` If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can . '
"This was soon done , and then the young man drove off the sheep , leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly ; and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen , and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures ."
"Of course the king was quite ignorant of these arrangements , and boldly entered the palace of the Lion Fairy , who was waiting for him , with her tail lashing furiously , for she still kept her lion 's shape ."
"With a roar that shook the walls she flung herself upon him ; but he was on the watch , and a blow from his sword cut off the paw she had put forth to strike him dead ."
"She fell back , and with his helmet still on and his shield up , he set his foot on her throat ."
"` Give me back the wife and the child you have stolen from me , ' he said , ` or you shall not live another second ! '"
But the fairy answered : ` Look through the window at that lake and see if it is in my power to give them to you . '
"And the king looked , and through the crystal walls he beheld his wife and daughter floating on the quicksilver ."
At that sight the Lion Fairy and all her wickedness was forgotten .
"Flinging off his helmet , he shouted to them with all his might ."
"The queen knew his voice , and she and Muffette ran to the window and held out their hands ."
"Then the king swore a solemn oath that he would never leave the spot without taking them if it should cost him his life ; and he meant it , though at the moment he did not know what he was undertaking ."
"Three years passed by , and the king was no nearer to obtaining his heart 's desire ."
"He had suffered every hardship that could be imagined -- nettles had been his bed , wild fruits more bitter than gall his food , while his days had been spent in fighting the hideous monsters which kept him from the palace ."
"He had not advanced one single step , nor gained one solitary advantage ."
"Now he was almost in despair , and ready to defy everything and throw himself into the lake ."
"It was at this moment of his blackest misery that , one night , a dragon who had long watched him from the roof crept to his side ."
"` You thought that love would conquer all obstacles , ' said he ; ` well , you have found it has n't !"
"But if you will swear to me by your crown and sceptre that you will give me a dinner of the food that I never grow tired of , whenever I choose to ask for it , I will enable you to reach your wife and daughter . '"
"Ah , how glad the king was to hear that !"
What oath would he not have taken so as to clasp his wife and child in is arms ?
"Joyfully he swore whatever the dragon asked of him ; then he jumped on his back , and in another instant would have been carried by the strong wings into the castle if the nearest monsters had not happened to awake and hear the noise of talking and swum to the shore to give battle ."
"The fight was long and hard , and when the king at last beat back his foes another struggle awaited him ."
"At the entrance gigantic bats , owls , and crows set upon him from all sides ; but the dragon had teeth and claws , while the queen broke off sharp bits of glass and stabbed and cut in her anxiety to help her husband ."
"At length the horrible creatures flew away ; a sound like thunder was heard , the palace and the monsters vanished , while , at the same moment -- no one knew how -- the king found himself standing with his wife and daughter in the hall of his own home ."
"The dragon had disappeared with all the rest , and for some years no more was heard or thought of him ."
"Muffette grew every day more beautiful , and when she was fourteen the kings and emperors of the neighbouring countries sent to ask her in marriage for themselves or their sons ."
"For a long time the girl turned a deaf ear to all their prayers ; but at length a young prince of rare gifts touched her heart , and though the king had left her free to choose what husband she would , he had secretly hoped that out of all the wooers this one might be his son-in-law ."
"So they were betrothed that some day with great pomp , and then with many tears , the prince set out for his father 's court , bearing with him a portrait of Muffette ."
"The days passed slowly to Muffette , in spite of her brave efforts to occupy herself and not to sadden other people by her complaints ."
One morning she was playing on her harp in the queen 's chamber when the king burst into the room and clasped his daughter in his arms with an energy that almost frightened her .
"` Oh , my child !"
my dear child !
why were you ever born ? '
"Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head. “Look here,” he said at length, “it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear—I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig; at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.”"
"The good Hans was terrified. “Goodness!” he said, “help me out of this fix; you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.” “I shall risk something at that game,” answered the lad, “but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.” So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path."
"The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm. “When I think over it properly,” said he to himself, “I have even gained by the exchange; first there is the good roast-meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers; I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be!”"
"As he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow; as his wheel whirred he sang—"
"“I sharpen scissors and quickly grind, My coat blows out in the wind behind.”"
"Hans stood still and looked at him; at last he spoke to him and said, “All’s well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding.” “Yes,”"
"answered the scissors-grinder, “the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?”"
"“I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.”"
“And the pig?”
“That I got for a cow.”
“And the cow?”
“I took that instead of a horse.”
“And the horse?”
“For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.”
“And the gold?”
"“Well, that was my wages for seven years’ service.”"
"“You have known how to look after yourself each time,” said the grinder. “If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.”"
"“How shall I manage that?” said Hans. “You must be a grinder, as I am; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here; it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose; will you do it?”"
"“How can you ask?” answered Hans. “I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, what need I trouble about any longer?” and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange. “Now,” said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, “here is a strong stone for you into the bargain; you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully.”"
"Hans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart; his eyes shone with joy. “I must have been born with a caul,” he cried; “everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child.”"
"Meanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute; the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then."
"He crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water. When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favour also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him."
"“There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I,” he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home."
84 Hans Married
"There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife. He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot. Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, “Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back.” “Yes,” said Hans, “I will do all that.” Then the wooer put on a pair of old patched trousers, went to a rich peasant’s daughter in the next village, and said, “Won’t you marry my nephew Hans—you will get an honest and sensible man who will suit you?” The covetous father asked, “How is it with regard to his means? Has he bread to break?” “Dear friend,” replied the wooer, “my young nephew has a snug berth, a nice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he has quite as many patches as I have,” (and as he spoke, he slapped the patches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also.) “If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said.” Then the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said, “If that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the marriage.”"
"So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom’s property, Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, “I might spoil my good coat.” Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock-frock, and said, “That patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it,” meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own."
"“Were you indeed at the wedding?” “Yes, indeed I was there, and in full dress. My head-dress was of snow; then the sun came out, and it was melted. My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns which tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I pushed against a stone and they said, “Klink,” and broke in two."
85 The Gold-Children
"There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth. But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold. As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said, “Hark you, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.” Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat?” The gold fish continued, “That shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire.” “If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favour.” “Yes,” said the fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over.” Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home. But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said, “Husband, how has all this come to pass? It suits me very well.” “Yes,” said the man, “it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat.” Said the wife, “But I have got nothing and don’t know where to find anything in this new house.” “There is no need of your knowing,” said the man, “for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it.” When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect."
"Then the woman cried joyfully, “What more can you want, my dear?” and they sat down, and ate and drank together. When they had had enough, the woman said, “But husband, whence come all these riches?” “Alas,”"
"answered he, “do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.” “Very good,” said she, “if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.” However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty. And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman’s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish. “Listen,” said the fish, “if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life’s sake don’t reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!” “I will take good care,”"
"answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut. “Now you have got what you want,”"
"At last the old man said, ""Come down, honey. I am afraid the limb will break if you don't."" Then, as the boy still remained, he told him that those were not eating-apples, that they were just common cooking-apples, and that there were worms in them. But the boy said he didn't mind a little thing like that. So then the old gentleman got irritated, and called the dog, and threw turf at the boy, and at last saluted him with pieces of turf and decayed cabbages; and after the lad had gone away the old man pried the bull-dog's jaws open and found a mouthful of pantaloons and a freckle."
"I do not tell this, of course, in Mr. Webster's language, but I give the main points as they recur now to my mind."
"Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years and have carefully examined his style, I am free to say that his ideas about writing a book are not the same as mine. Of course it is a great temptation for a young author to write a book that will have a large sale; but that should not be all. We should have a higher object than that, and strive to interest those who read the book. It should not be jerky and scattering in its statements."
"I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man who is now no more, a man who did so much for the world and who could spell the longest word without hesitation, but I speak of these things just as I would expect others to criticise my work. If one aspire to be a member of the literati of his day, he must expect to be criticised. I have been criticised myself. When I was in public life, as a justice of the peace in the Rocky Mountains, a man came in one day and criticised me so that I did not get over it for two weeks."
"I might add, though I dislike to speak of it now, that Mr. Webster was at one time a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts. I believe that was the only time he ever stepped aside from the strait and narrow way."
"A good many people do not know this, but it is true."
"Mr. Webster was also a married man, yet he never murmured or repined."
CHAPTER XXIV.
BEFO' THE WAH CAUSES WHICH LED TO IT MASTERLY GRASP OF THE SUBJECT SHOWN BY THE AUTHOR.
"A Man named Lopez in 1851 attempted to annex Cuba, thus furnishing for our Republican wrapper a genuine Havana filler; but he failed, and was executed, while his plans were not."
"Franklin Pierce was elected President on the Democratic ticket, running against General Scott, the Whig candidate. Slavery began to be discussed again, when Stephen A. Douglas, in Congress, advocated squatter sovereignty, or the right for each Territory to decide whether it would be a free or a slave State. The measure became a law in 1854."
"That was what made trouble in Kansas. The two elements, free and slave, were arrayed against each other, and for several years friends from other States had to come over and help Kansas bury its dead. The condition of things for some time was exceedingly mortifying to the citizen who went out to milk after dark without his gun."
"Trouble with Mexico arose, owing to the fact that the government had used a poor and unreliable map in establishing the line: so General Gadsden made a settlement for the disputed ground, and we paid Mexico ten millions of dollars. It is needless to say that we have since seen the day when we wished that we had it back."
"Two ports of entry were now opened to us in Japan by Commodore Perry's Expedition, and cups and saucers began to be more plentiful in this country, many of the wealthier deciding at that time not to cool tea in the saucer or drink it vociferously from that vessel. This custom and the Whig party passed away at the same time."
The Republican or Anti-Slavery party nominated for President John C.
"Frémont, who received the vote of eleven States, but James Buchanan was elected, and proved to the satisfaction of the world that there is nothing to prevent any unemployed man's applying for the Presidency of the United States; also that if his life has been free from ideas and opinions he may be elected sometimes where one who has been caught in the very act of thinking, and had it proved on him, might be defeated."
Chief Justice Taney now stated that slaves could be taken into any State of the Union by their owners without forfeiting the rights of ownership.
"This was called the Dred Scott decision, and did much to irritate Abolitionists like John Brown, whose soul as this book goes to press is said to be marching on. Brown was a Kansas man with a mission and massive whiskers. He would be called now a crank; but his action in seizing a United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry and declaring the slaves free was regarded by the South as thoroughly representative of the Northern feeling."
"The country now began to be in a state of restlessness. Brown had been captured and hanged as a traitor. Northern men were obliged to leave their work every little while to catch a negro, crate him, and return him to his master or give him a lift towards Canada; and, as the negro was replenishing the earth at an astonishing rate, general alarm broke out."
"Douglas was the champion of squatter sovereignty, John C. Breckinridge of the doctrine that slaves could be checked through as personal baggage into any State of the Union, and Lincoln of the anti-slavery principle which afterwards constituted the spinal column of the Federal Government as opposed to the Confederacy of the seceded States."
"Lincoln was elected, which reminded him of an anecdote. Douglas and several other candidates were defeated, which did not remind them of anything."
"South Carolina seceded in December, 1860, and soon after Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit."
"The following February the Confederacy was organized at Montgomery, Alabama, and Jefferson Davis was elected President. Long and patient effort on the part of the historian to ascertain how he liked it has been entirely barren of results. Alexander H. Stephens was made Vice-President."
"Everything belonging to the United States and not thoroughly fastened down was carried away by the Confederacy, while President Buchanan looked the other way or wrote airy persiflage to tottering dynasties which slyly among themselves characterized him as a neat and cleanly old lady."
"Had Buchanan been a married man it is generally believed now that his wife would have prevented the war. Then she would have called James out from under the bed and allowed him to come to the table for his meals with the family. But he was not married, and the war came on."
"Major Anderson was afraid to remain at Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, so crossed over to Fort Sumter. The South regarded this as hostility, and the fort was watched to see if any one should attempt to divide his lunch with the garrison, which it was declared would be regarded as an act of defiance. The reader will see by this that a deaf and dumb asylum in Northern Michigan was about the only safe place for a peaceable man at that time."
"President Lincoln found himself placed at the head of a looted government on the sharp edge of a crisis that had not been properly upholstered. The Buchanan cabinet had left little except a burglar's tool or two here and there to mark its operations, and, with the aged and infirm General Scott at the head of a little army, and no encouragement except from the Abolitionists, many of whom had never seen a colored man outside of a minstrel performance, the President stole incog. into Washington, like a man who had agreed to lecture there."
"Southern officers resigned daily from the army and navy to go home and join the fortunes of their several States. Meantime, the Federal government moved about like a baby elephant loaded with shot, while the new Confederacy got men, money, arms, and munitions of war from every conceivable point."
"Finding that supplies were to be sent to Major Anderson, General Peter G. T. Beauregard summoned Major Anderson to surrender. General Beauregard, after the war, became one of the good, kind gentlemen who annually stated over their signatures that they had examined the Louisiana State Lottery and that there was no deception about it. The Lottery felt grateful for this, and said that the general should never want while it had a roof of its own."
"Major Anderson had seventy men, while General Beauregard had seven thousand. After a bombardment and a general fight of thirty-four hours, the starved and suffocated garrison yielded to overwhelming numbers."
"Sherman's army of sixty thousand, after a month's rest at Savannah, started north to unite with Grant in the final blow. ""Before it was terror, behind it ashes."""
"Columbia was captured February 17, and burned, without Sherman's authority, the night following. Charleston was evacuated the next day."
"Johnston was recalled to take command, and opposed the march of Sherman, but was driven back after fierce engagements at Bentonville and Averysboro. On March 25 Lee decided to attack Grant, and, while the latter was busy, get out of Richmond and join Johnston, but when this battle, known as the attack on Fort Steadman, was over, Grant's hold was tighter than ever."
"Sheridan attacked Lee's rear with a heavy force, and at Five Forks, April 1, the surprised garrison was defeated with five thousand captured. The next day the entire Union army advanced, and the line of Confederate intrenchments was broken. On the following day Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, but Mr. Davis was not there. He had gone away. Rather than meet General Grant and entertain him when there was no pie in the house, he and the Treasury had escaped from the haunts of man, wishing to commune with nature for a while. He was captured at Irwinsville, Georgia, under peculiar and rather amusing circumstances."
"He was never punished, with the exception perhaps that he published a book and did not realize anything from it."
"Lee fled to the westward, but was pursued by the triumphant Federals, especially by Sheridan, whose cavalry hung on his flanks day and night."
"Food failed the fleeing foe, and the young shoots of trees for food and the larger shoots of the artillery between meals were too much for that proud army, once so strong and confident."
Let us not dwell on the particulars.
"As Sheridan planted his cavalry squarely across Lee's path of retreat, the worn but heroic tatters of a proud army prepared to sell themselves for a bloody ransom and go down fighting, but Grant had demanded their surrender, and, seeing back of the galling, skirmishing cavalry solid walls of confident infantry, the terms of surrender were accepted by General Lee, and April 9 the Confederate army stacked its arms near Appomattox Court-House."
"The Confederate war debt was never paid, for some reason or other, but the Federal debt when it was feeling the best amounted to two billion eight hundred and forty-four million dollars. One million men lost their lives."
Was it worth while?
"In the midst of the general rejoicing, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre, April 14. The assassin was captured in a dying condition in a burning barn, through a crack in the boarding of which he had been shot by a soldier named Boston Corbett. He died with no sympathetic applause to soothe the dull, cold ear of death."
"West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, and Nevada in 1864."
"The following chapters will be devoted to more peaceful details, while we cheerfully close the sorrowful pages in which we have confessed that, with all our greatness as a nation, we could not stay the tide of war."
CHAPTER XXIX.
"TOO MUCH LIBERTY IN PLACES AND NOT ENOUGH ELSEWHERE. THOUGHTS ON THE LATE WAR WHO IS THE BIGGER ASS, THE MAN WHO WILL NOT FORGIVE AND FORGET, OR THE MAWKISH AND MOIST-EYED SNIVELLER WHO WANTS TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME?"
"When Patrick Henry put his old cast-iron spectacles on the top of his head and whooped for liberty, he did not know that some day we should have more of it than we knew what to do with. He little dreamed that the time would come when we should have more liberty than we could pay for."
"When Mr. Henry sawed the air and shouted for liberty or death, I do not believe that he knew the time would come when Liberty would stand on Bedloe's Island and yearn for rest and change of scene."
"It seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways. We have more liberty than we have money. We guarantee that every man in America shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense, and the less of an American he is the more liberty he can have. Should he desire to enjoy himself, all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer. The more I study American institutions the more I regret that I was not born a foreigner, so that I could have something to say about the management of our great land. If I could not be a foreigner, I believe I should prefer to be a policeman or an Indian not taxed."
"I am often led to ask, in the language of the poet, ""Is civilization a failure, and is the Caucasian played out?"""
"Almost every one can have a good deal of fun in America except the American. He seems to be so busy paying his taxes that he has very little time to vote, or to mingle in society's giddy whirl, or to mix up with the nobility. That is the reason why the alien who rides across the United States in the ""Limited Mail"" and writes a book about us before breakfast wonders why we are always in a hurry. That also is the reason why we have to throw our meals into ourselves with such despatch, and hardly have time to maintain a warm personal friendship with our families."
"We do not care much for wealth, but we must have freedom, and freedom costs money. We have advertised to furnish a bunch of freedom to every man, woman, and child who comes to our shores, and we are going to deliver the goods whether we have any left for ourselves or not."
"What would the great world beyond the seas say to us if some day the blue-eyed Oriental, with his heart full of love for our female seminaries and our old women's homes, should land upon our coasts and crave freedom in car-load lots but find that we were using all the liberty ourselves? But what do we want of liberty, anyhow? What could we do with it if we had it? It takes a man of leisure to enjoy liberty, and we have no leisure whatever. It is a good thing to keep in the house for the use of guests, but we don't need it for ourselves."
"Therefore we have a statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, because it shows that we keep Liberty on tap winter and summer. We want the whole broad world to remember that when it gets tired of oppression it can come here to America and oppress us. We are used to it, and we rather like it. If we don't like it, we can get on the steamer and go abroad, where we may visit the effete monarchies and have a high old time."
"The sight of the Goddess of Liberty standing there in New York harbor night and day, bathing her feet in the rippling sea, is a good thing. It is first-rate. It may also be productive of good in a direction that many have not thought of. As she stands there day after day, bathing her feet in the broad Atlantic, perhaps some moss-grown alien landing on our shore and moving toward the Far West may fix the bright picture in his so-called mind, and, remembering how, on his arrival in New York, he saw Liberty bathing her feet with impunity, he may be led in after-years to try it on himself."
More citizens and less voters will some day be adopted as the motto of the Republic.
"One reference to the late war, and I will close. I want to refer especially to the chronic reconciler who when war was declared was not involved in it, but who now improves every opportunity, especially near election-time, to get out a tired olive-branch and make a tableau of himself. He is worse than the man who cannot forgive or forget."
"The growth of reconciliation between the North and the South is the slow growth of years, and the work of generations. When any man, North or South, in a public place takes occasion to talk in a mellow and mawkish way of the great love he now has for his old enemy, watch him. He is getting ready to ask a favor. There is a beautiful, poetic idea in the reunion of two contending and shattered elements of a great nation."
"There is something beautifully pathetic in the picture of the North and the South clasped in each other's arms and shedding a torrent of hot tears down each other's backs as it is done in a play, but do you believe that the aged mothers on either side have learned to love the foe with much violence yet? Do you believe that the crippled veteran, North or South, now passionately loves the adversary who robbed him of his glorious youth, made him a feeble ruin, and mowed down his comrades with swift death? Do you believe that either warrior is so fickle that he has entirely deserted the cause for which he fought? Even the victor cannot ask that."
"He was put in a common jail to await trial. Afterwards he was discharged, but was never again on good terms with the government, and never rose again."
"When he came into town and registered at the hotel the papers did not say anything about it; and so he stopped taking them, thus falling into ignorance and oblivion at the same moment, although at one time he had lacked but a single vote to make him President of the United States."
"England and France still continued at war, and American vessels were in hot water a good deal, as they were liable to be overhauled by both parties. England especially, with the excuse that she was looking for deserters, stopped American vessels and searched them, going through the sleeping-apartments before the work was done up, one of the rudest things known in international affairs."
"An Embargo Act was passed forbidding American vessels to leave port, an act which showed that the bray of the ass had begun to echo through the halls of legislation even at that early day."
"In the mean time, Jefferson had completed his second term, and James Madison, the Republican candidate, had succeeded him at the helm of state, as it was then called."
"His party favored a war with England, especially as the British had begun again to stir up the red brother."
"Madison was a Virginian. He was a man of unblemished character, and was not too haughty to have fun sometimes. This endeared him to the whole nation. Unlike Adams, he never swelled up so that his dignity hurt him under the arms. He died in 1836, genial and sunny to the last."
"It was now thought best to bring on the war of 1812, which began by an Indian attack at Tippecanoe on General Harrison's troops in 1811, when the Indians were defeated. June 19, 1812, war was finally declared."
"The first battle was between the forces under General Hull on our side and the English and Indians on the British side, near Detroit. The troops faced each other, Tecumseh being the Indian leader, and both armies stood ready to have one of the best battles ever given in public or private, when General Hull was suddenly overcome with remorse at the thought of shedding blood, especially among people who were so common, and, shaking a large table-cloth out the window in token of peace, amid the tears of his men, surrendered his entire command in a way that reminded old settlers very much of Cornwallis."
CHAPTER XX.
THE WAR WITH CANADA.
"October 13, General Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River and attacked the British at Queenstown Heights. The latter retreated, and General Brock was killed. General Van Rensselaer went back after the rest of his troops, but they refused to cross, on the ground that the general had no right to take them out of the United States, and thus the troops left in charge at the Heights were compelled to surrender."
"These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for them, because they didn't want to cross the Canadian line, would not have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers, very likely, in later years."
"August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and Guerriere, off the Massachusetts coast. The Constitution, called ""Old Ironsides,"" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull. The Guerriere was first to attack, but got no reply until both vessels were very close together, when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop-sided on the off side. She surrendered, but was of no value, being so full of holes that she would not hold a cargo of railroad-trestles."
"The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea regarding their ammunition, holding their fire until the enemy was at arm's length, was the cause of more than one victory. They were obliged, indeed, to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not produced here, and powder was imported."
"October 13, the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place, off the North Carolina coast. The Frolic was an English brig, and she wound up as most frolics do, with a severe pain and a five-dollar fine. After the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards, the decks of the Frolic were a sight to behold. There were not enough able-bodied men to surrender the ship. She was captured by the boarding-crew, but there was not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors."
"Other victories followed on the sea, and American privateers had more fun than anybody."
"Madison was re-elected, thus showing that his style of administration suited one and all, and the war was prosecuted at a great rate. It became a sort of fight with Canada, the latter being supported by English arms by land and sea. Of course the Americans would have preferred to fight England direct, and many were in favor of attacking London: but when the commanding officer asked those of the army who had the means to go abroad to please raise their right hands, it was found that the trip must be abandoned. Those who had the means to go did not have suitable clothes for making a respectable appearance, and so it was given up."
"Three divisions were made of the army, all having an attack on Canada as the object in view, viz., the army of the Centre, the army of the North, and the army of the West. The armies of the Centre and North did not do much, aside from the trifling victory at York, and President Madison said afterwards in a letter to the writer's family that the two armies did not accomplish enough to pay the duty on them. The army of the West managed to stand off the British, though the latter still held Michigan and threatened Ohio."
"September 10, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and was well received. Perry was twenty-seven years old, and was given command of a flotilla on Lake Erie, provided he would cut the timber and build it, meantime boarding himself. The British had long been in possession of Lake Erie, and when Perry got his scows afloat they issued invitations for a general display of carnage. They bore down on Perry and killed all the men on his flag-ship but eight. Then he helped them fire the last gun, and with the flag they jumped into a boat which they paddled for the Niagara under a galling fire. This was the first time that a galling fire had ever been used at sea. Perry passed within pistol-shot of the British, and in less than a quarter of an hour after he trod the poop of the Niagara he was able to write to General Harrison, ""We have met the enemy, and they are ours."""
"Proctor and Tecumseh were at Malden, with English and Indians, preparing to plunder the frontier and kill some more women and children as soon as they felt rested up. At the news of Perry's victory, Harrison decided to go over and stir them up. Arriving at Malden, he found it deserted, and followed the foe to the river Thames, where he charged with his Kentucky horsemen right through the British lines and so on down the valley, where they reformed and started back to charge on their rear, when the whole outfit surrendered except the Indians. Proctor, however, was mounted on a tall fox-hunter which ran away with him. He afterwards wrote back to General Harrison that he made every effort to surrender personally, but that circumstances prevented. He was greatly pained by this."
"The Americans now charged on the Indians, and Johnson, the commander of the Blue Grass Dragoons, fired a shot which took Tecumseh just west of the watch-pocket. He died, he said, tickled to death to know that he had been shot by an American."
"Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, having taken the British brig Peacock, was given command of the Chesapeake, which he took to Boston to have repaired. While there, he got a challenge from the Shannon. He put to sea with half a crew, and a shot in his chest that is, the arm-chest of the ship burst the whole thing open and annoyed every one on board. The enemy boarded the Chesapeake and captured her, so Captain Lawrence, her brave commander, breathed his last, after begging his men not to give up the ship."
"However, the victories on the Canadian border settled the war once more for the time, and cheered the Americans very much."
"The Indians in 1813 fell upon Fort Mimms and massacred the entire garrison, men, women, and children, not because they felt a personal antipathy towards them, but because they the red brothers had sold their lands too low and their hearts were sad in their bosoms. There is really no fun in trading with an Indian, for he is devoid of business instincts, and reciprocity with the red brother has never been a success."
"General Jackson took some troops and attacked the red brother, killing six hundred of him and capturing the rest of the herd. Jackson did not want to hear the Indians speak pieces and see them smoke the pipe of peace, but buried the dead and went home. He had very little of the romantic complaint which now and then breaks out regarding the Indian, but knew full well that all the Indians ever born on the face of the earth could not compensate for the cruel and violent death of one good, gentle, patient American mother."
Admiral Cockburn now began to pillage the coast of the Southern States and borrow communion services from the churches of Virginia and the Carolinas. He also murdered the sick in their beds.
"A long debate ensued, and, according to tradition, while the members of the Assembly stood around the table taking a farewell look at the charter, one of the largest members of the house fell on the governor's breast and wept so copiously on his shirt-frill that harsh words were used by his Excellency; a general quarrel ensued, the lights went out, and when they were relighted the charter was gone."
"Captain Wadsworth had taken it and concealed it in a hollow tree, since called the Charter Oak. After Andros was ejected from the Boston office, the charter was brought out again, and business under it was resumed."
"Important documents, however, should not be, as a general thing, secreted in trees. The author once tried this while young, and when engaged to, or hoping to become engaged to, a dear one whose pa was a singularly coarse man and who hated a young man who came as a lover at his daughter's feet with nothing but a good education and his great big manly heart. He wanted a son-in-law with a brewery; and so he bribed the boys of the neighborhood to break up a secret correspondence between the two young people and bring the mail to him. This was the cause of many a heart-ache, and finally the marriage of the sweet young lady to a brewer who was mortgaged so deeply that he wandered off somewhere and never returned. Years afterwards the brewery needed repairs, and one of the large vats was found to contain all of the missing man that would not assimilate with the beer, viz., his watch. Quite a number of people at that time quit the use of beer, and the author gave his hand in marriage to a wealthy young lady who was attracted by his gallantry and fresh young beauty."
"Roger Williams now settled at Providence Plantation, where he was joined by Mrs. Hutchinson, who also believed that the church and state should not be united, but that the state should protect the church and that neither should undertake to boss the other. It was also held that religious qualifications should not be required of political aspirants, also that no man should be required to whittle his soul into a shape to fit the religious auger-hole of another."
"This was the beginning of Rhode Island. She desired at once to join the New England Colony, but was refused, as she had no charter. Plymouth claimed also to have jurisdiction over Rhode Island. This was very much like Plymouth."
"Having banished Roger Williams and Mrs. Hutchinson to be skinned by the Pequods and Narragansetts over at Narragansett Pier, they went on about their business, flogging Quakers, also ducking old women who had lumbago, and burning other women who would not answer affirmatively when asked, ""Be you a witch?"""
"Then when Roger began to make improvements and draw the attention of Eastern capital to Rhode Island and to organize a State or Colony with a charter, Plymouth said, ""Hold on, Roger: religiously we have cast you out, to live on wild strawberries, clams, and Indians, but from a mercantile and political point of view you will please notice that we have a string which you will notice is attached to your wages and discoveries."""
"Afterwards, however, Roger Williams obtained the necessary funds from admiring friends with which to go to England and obtain a charter which united the Colonies yet gave to all the first official right to liberty of conscience ever granted in Europe or America. Prior to that a man's conscience had a brass collar on it with the royal arms engraved thereon, and was kept picketed out in the king's grounds. The owner could go and look at it on Sundays, but he never had the use of it."
"With the advent of freedom of political opinion, the individual use of the conscience has become popularized, and the time is coming when it will grow to a great size under our wise institutions and fostering skies. Instead of turning over our consciences to the safety deposit company of a great political party or religious organization and taking the key in our pocket, let us have individual charge of this useful little instrument and be able finally to answer for its growth or decay."
CHAPTER VII.
THE DISCOVERY OF NEW YORK.
The author will now refer to the discovery of the Hudson River and the town of New York via Fort Lee and the 125th Street Ferry.
"New York was afterwards sold for twenty-four dollars, the whole island."
"When I think of this I go into my family gallery, which I also use as a swear room, and tell those ancestors of mine what I think of them. Where were they when New York was sold for twenty-four dollars? Were they having their portraits painted by Landseer, or their deposition taken by Jeffreys, or having their Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes made?"
"Do not encourage them to believe that they will escape me in future years. Some of them died unregenerate, and are now, I am told, in a country where they may possibly be damned; and I will attend to the others personally."
"Twenty-four dollars for New York! Why, my Croton-water tax on one house and lot with fifty feet four and one-fourth inches front is fifty-nine dollars and no questions asked. Why, you can't get a voter for that now."
"Henry or Hendrik Hudson was an English navigator, of whose birth and early history nothing is known definitely, hence his name is never mentioned in many of the best homes in New York."
"In 1607 he made a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage. In one of his voyages he discovered Cape Cod, and later on the Hudson River."
This was one hundred and seventeen years after Columbus discovered America; which shows that the discovering business was not pushed as it should have been by those who had it in charge.
"Hudson went up the river as far as Albany, but, finding no one there whom he knew, he hastened back as far as 209th Street West, and anchored."
"He discovered Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and made other journeys by water, though aquatting was then in its infancy. Afterwards his sailors became mutinous, and set Hendrik and his son, with seven infirm sailors, afloat."
Ah! Whom have we here?
"It is Hendrik Hudson, who discovered the Hudson River."
"Here he has just landed at the foot of 209th Street, New York, where he offered the Indians liquor, but they refused."
How 209th Street has changed!
The artist has been fortunate in getting the expression of the Indians in the act of refusing. Mr. Hudson's great reputation lies in the fact that he discovered the river which bears his name; but the thinking mind will at once regard the discovery of an Indian who does not drink as far more wonderful.
"Some historians say that this especial delegation was swept away afterward by a pestilence, whilst others commenting on the incident maintain that Hudson lied."
"said he; “and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.” “Ah,” said the woman, “I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.”"
"The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time. “Listen,” said the fish, “I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me into six pieces; give your wife two of them to eat, two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a blessing.”"
"The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him. It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces that were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman’s wife bore two children who were made entirely of gold. The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise. Then they said, “Father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world.” But he answered sorrowfully, “How shall I bear it if you go away, and I know not how it fares with you?” Then they said, “The two golden lilies remain here. By them you can see how it is with us; if they are fresh, then we are in health; if they are withered, we are ill; if they perish, then we are dead.” So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and when they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer. When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he was about to enter it, the people said, It is not safe for you to ride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. You will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.’"
"But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, “I must and will ride through it.” Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When he had ridden onward a little he heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking together. From one side came cries of, “There is one,” but from the other, “Let him go, ’tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse, what should we gain from him?”"
"So the gold-child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him. One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she existed in the world. And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and said, “I love thee with my whole heart, wilt thou be my wife?” He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, “Yes, I will be thy wife, and be true to thee my whole life long.” Then they were married, and just as they were in the greatest happiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that his daughter’s wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, “Where is the bridegroom?” They showed him the gold-child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins. Then the father said wrathfully, “A vagabond shall never have my daughter!” and was about to kill him. Then the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, “He is my husband, and I love him with all my heart!” until at last he allowed himself to be appeased. Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter’s husband was a common ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground."
"Then he went back and thought, “What a good thing it was that I restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.” But the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, “I must go out hunting.”"
"She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, “You might easily meet with a great misfortune,” but he answered, “I must and will go.”"
"Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not long before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a witch. He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, “What are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”"
"“Have you not seen a stag?” “Yes,” answered she, “I know the stag well,” and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently. “Wilt thou be silent, thou odious toad,” said he, “or I will shoot thee dead.” Then the witch cried out in a passion, “What! will you slay my little dog?” and immediately transformed him, so that he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and thought, “That which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!” But at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when one of them suddenly drooped."
"“Good heavens!” said he, “my brother has met with some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.” Then the father said, “Stay here, if I lose you also, what shall I do?” But he answered, “I must and will go forth!”"
"Then he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the great forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but he did not go near her, and said, “I will shoot you, if you will not bring my brother to life again.” She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to his human shape. But the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw each other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the forest, the one home to his bride, and the other to his father. The father then said, “I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.” Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death."
86 The Fox and the Geese
"The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said, “I come in the nick of time, you are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the other.” The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and said, “There is no mercy to be had! You must die.” At length one of them took heart and said, “If we poor geese are to yield up our vigorous young lives, show us the only possible favour and allow us one more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest.” “Yes,” said the fox, “that is reasonable, and a pious request. Pray away, I will wait till you are done.” Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying, “Ga! Ga!” and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also, “Ga! Ga!” The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together."
"When they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying without stopping.”"
87 The Poor Man and the Rich Man
"In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other; the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor. The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man."
"Then the Lord thought, “I shall be no burden to the rich man, I will stay the night with him.” When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted."
"The Lord answered, “I only ask for a night’s lodging.”"
"Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, “No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself."
"Go somewhere else for a lodging,” and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there."
"So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked. He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in. “Pass the night with me, it is already dark,” said he; “you cannot go any further to-night.”"
"This pleased the Lord, and he went in. The poor man’s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them. When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, “Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary.” “With all my heart,” he answered, “I will go and offer it to him;” and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly."
"But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground."
"Next morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest. When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey."
"But as he was standing at the door he turned round and said, “As you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them.” Then the man said, “What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.” And the Lord said to him, “Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?” “Oh, yes,” said the man; “if I can have that, too, I should like it very much.” And the Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house into a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on."
"The sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be. He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, “Tell me, what can have happened? Last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. Run over and see how that has come to pass.”"
"So his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her, “Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night’s lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes—eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut.”"
"When the rich man’s wife heard this, she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened. The man said, “I could tear myself to pieces! If I had but known that! That traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and I sent him away.” “Quick!” said his wife, “get on your horse. You can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you.”"
"The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him. “Yes,” said the Lord; “if I ever come back again, I will do so.” Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? “Yes,” said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted."
"So the Lord said to him, “Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.”"
"The rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said, “Gently, Lisa,” but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, “I wish your neck was broken!” Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. “I have still two wishes left,” said he, and comforted himself with that thought."
"And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry. The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. “If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world,” said he to himself, “I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on, I know that, beforehand. But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards.” Then he sighed and said, “Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.”"
"While watching the immense destruction of these insects we were startled by the outbreak of the thunderstorm high up on the mountains, but far above the peals of thunder rose the terrible sound of rushing water. Animals now came tearing out of the lowlands too terrified to notice whither they went, so that I stood ready, gun in hand, in case any of the dangerous kind should try to seek an asylum on my particular hill; but with the exception of a huge wild boar, who had to be shot as he charged up the slope, all took refuge elsewhere."
"Soon the water burst through the river bank, spreading over the country, sweeping down the tall grass jungle and surging and roaring round our hill. Packing all that was valuable in small parcels, we gathered them in a heap, hoping that the flood would subside ere it reached the building. All round about large trees, uprooted by the terrible force of the deluge, were swept along, several animals vainly trying to keep a footing among their roots and branches. At last the water reached the steps of the house; so, pulling our boat close up, we stepped in with what we could save and hung to the wooden posts of the building, vainly trusting that the worst had come; but it was not so, for we soon had to leave go the post and pass the boat's rope round a tree. The water then rushed in, the house toppled over, and it and its contents were swept away by the flood."
"In a short time the tree began to shake and bend, so we knew that it was being uprooted; therefore, letting go the rope, we launched forth upon the seething waste of waters and were whirled away. Onward we rushed through masses of logs, branches, the remains of houses, and such like wreck, having to be very careful that our frail vessel did not get upset or crushed. Twice we made for the tops of hills that showed themselves above water, but on approaching them we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals."
"Here a tiger crouched on a branch of a tree, seemingly too much alarmed at his perilous position to molest the half-dozen deer that crowded timidly together right underneath his perch. Up above him the smaller branches were stocked with monkeys, who looked very disconsolate at their enforced imprisonment. As we swept past, the tiger raised his head, gave a deep growl and showed his teeth, then crouched down again as if fully aware of his helplessness, and we had too much to think of ourselves to interfere with him."
"Gaining the open country, the scene was one of desolation; but the current was not so strong, so we turned round, seeing the flood was going down, and by nightfall we had got back to where the house had stood. Every vestige of the once pretty homestead had disappeared, with sheep and cattle, though the fowls had managed to find a roost on the topmost branches of some orange trees, which alone remained to mark the spot."
"As the moon rose, the mountaineers came down from the villages, and, embarking on rafts and in canoes, went round the different hills, shooting and spearing the animals that had swum there; and truly the sight of such a hunting scene was an exciting one. Here a stout stag, defending himself with his antlers as best he might against the spearsmen, kept up a gallant fight till death."
"The tiger we had seen in the morning took to swimming, and on being wounded with a spear turned on the nearest canoe, upsetting the hunters into the water, where a desperate encounter took place; but he was eventually dispatched by a blow from an ax not, however, before he had clawed some of his pursuers most severely."
"At daylight the water had entirely gone down, and a thick, muddy deposit covered all the lowland, while an immense number of snakes, scorpions, and other unpleasant creatures lay dead in all directions, upon which and the drowned animals vultures, crows and kites were feeding."
Queen Margaret and the Robbers.
There were once two kings of England at the same time. One was Henry VI.
"He was the rightful king, but a very weak and feeble man, and quite unfit to rule his kingdom."
"The other was young Edward, Duke of York, called Edward IV. He was made king by some of the nobles, who grew weary of Henry and his foolish deeds."
"A number of the English people were faithful to King Henry, but many others went over to King Edward's side, and there were quarrels between the two parties, which ended in a war. This war was called the War of the Roses, because the followers of Henry wore a red rose as their badge, and Edward's friends wore a white one."
"In one battle, fought at Hexham, the White Roses beat the Red ones, and King Henry was taken prisoner and sent to the Tower of London. His wife, Queen Margaret, with her little son, Prince Edward, escaped after the battle, and hid themselves in a wild forest. As they wandered among the trees, seeking some place where they might be safe from their enemies, they met a band of robbers. These rough men took away the queen's money and her jewels, tearing her necklace from her neck, and her rings from her fingers. Then they began to dispute as to who should have most of the stolen goods. And while they quarrelled, Queen Margaret took her little boy by the hand and ran away to a thick part of the wood. There they stayed until the angry voices of the robbers could no longer be heard, and then, in the growing darkness, they came stealthily from their hiding-place. They wandered on, knowing not where to go, hoping much to meet some of their friends, and fearing still more to be found by their enemies, the soldiers of the White Rose. But, alas! they saw no kind face, and night came on. Then, as they crept fearfully from tree to tree, they met another robber."
"The poor queen was much afraid that this robber, who looked very fierce, would kill her and the prince, because she had no riches left to give him. In despair she threw herself upon her knees before him, and said:"
"""My friend, this is the son of your king. I give him into your care."""
"The robber was much surprised to see the queen and the prince alone, with their clothes torn and stained, and their faces white from hunger and fatigue. But he was a kindhearted man, although his looks were rough, and before he became a robber he had been a follower of King Henry, so he was quite willing to do his best for the little prince. He took the boy in his arms, and led the way to a cave in the forest, where he lived with his wife. And in this poor shelter, the queen and her son stayed for two days, listening to every sound, and fearing that their enemies would find them. On the third day, however, the friendly robber met some of the lords of the Red Rose in the forest, and led them to the cave. The queen and prince were overjoyed to see their friends, and soon they escaped with them to a place of safety."
"Their hiding-place has been called ""Queen Margaret's Cave"" ever since that time. If you go to Hexham Forest, you will be able to see it."
William Caxton
"In old days, books were not printed as they are now; they were written by hand. This took a long time to do, so there were not many books, and they were so dear that only the rich could buy them."
"But after a time, some clever men made a machine, called a printing-press, which could print letters."
"About that time, an Englishman, named William Caxton, lived in Holland, and copied books for a great lady. He says his hand grew tired with writing, and his eyes became dim with much looking on white paper. So he learned how to print, and had a printing-press made for himself, which he brought to England. He set it up in a little shop in London, and then he began to print books. He printed books of all sorts tales, and poetry, and history, and prayers, and sermons. In the time which it had formerly taken him to write one book, he could now print thousands."
"All sorts of people crowded to his shop to see Caxton's wonderful press; sometimes the king went with his nobles. Many of them took written books with them, which they wished to have put into print. Some people asked Caxton to use in his books the most curious words he could find; others wished him to print only old and homely words. Caxton liked best the common, simple words which men used daily in their speech."
"Caxton did a very good thing when he brought the printing-press to England, for, after that, books became much cheaper, so that many people could buy them, and learning spread in the land."
Sir Philip Sidney
"When Elizabeth was Queen of England it was a time of great deeds and great men. The queen was brave and clever herself, so she liked to have brave and clever people around her. Great soldiers, and writers, and statesmen went to her court; and when brave seamen came back from their voyages to unknown lands far away, they were invited by the queen to visit her, and tell her of all the strange places and people they had seen. In this Elizabeth was wise, for men did their best to show themselves worthy of her favours."
"Among all the great men at court, none was more beloved than Sir Philip Sidney. He was called ""the darling of the court""."
"At that time, there was much trouble and many wars in some other countries, where people were fighting for the right to worship God in their own way. Philip Sidney heard of these things when he was a boy in his father's house, and his heart was stirred with pity. Later, when he was in France, a great number of people were cruelly killed because they would not pray in the way which the king ordered. Sidney never forgot the dreadful sights and sounds of that sad time, and when Queen Elizabeth sent an army to help the people of Holland, who were fighting for their freedom, he asked for leave to go with it. This was granted to him, and he was made one of the leaders."
"“I must do everything thou biddest me,” said the little man. “Good,”"
said the soldier; “then in the first place help me out of this well.”
"The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry."
"When he was above, he said to the little man, “Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.” In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift as the wind on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the little man re-appeared."
"“It is all done,” said he, “and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?” inquired the dwarf. “At this moment, none,” answered the soldier; “Thou canst return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon thee.” “Nothing more is needed than that thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before thee at once.” Thereupon he vanished from his sight."
"The soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsomely as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said, “I have served the King faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.” “What am I to do?” asked the little man. “Late at night, when the King’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.” The mannikin said, “That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.” When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess. “Aha! art thou there?” cried the soldier, “get to thy work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.” When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said, “Pull off my boots for me,” and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed."
"Next morning when the princess arose, she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. “I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,” said she, “and taken into a soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”"
"“The dream may have been true,” said the King, “I will give thee a piece of advice. Fill thy pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it, and then if thou art carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.” But unseen by the King, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow."
"Next morning the King sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying, “It must have rained peas, last night.” “We must think of something else,” said the King; “keep thy shoes on when thou goest to bed, and before thou comest back from the place where thou art taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.” The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him."
"“Do what I bid thee,” replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed."
"Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter’s shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him, “Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”"
"His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin. “Have no fear,” said the latter to his master. “Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.” Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the King. “What is it?”"
"asked the King. “That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.” “Thou mayst smoke three,” answered the King, “but do not imagine that I will spare thy life.” Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, “What does my lord command?” “Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”"
"Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and the princess to wife."
117 The Wilful Child
"Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do at her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground."
118 The Three Army-Surgeons
"Three army-surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly, were travelling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night. The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going? “We are roaming about the world and practising our art.”"
"“Just show me for once in a way what you can do,” said the host. Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning; the second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning; the third said he would cut out his eyes and heal them again next morning. “If you can do that,” said the innkeeper, “you have learnt everything.” They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they carried the little bottle in which it was, constantly with them. Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper. The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it. The girl, however, had a lover in secret, who was a soldier. When therefore the innkeeper, the three army-surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat. The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again; She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chattered away together. While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army-surgeons, and ran off with them. When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty. Then she said in a fright to her lover, “Ah, miserable girl, what shall I do? The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning?” “Be easy,” said he, “I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand. Which hand was it?” “The right one.” Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner’s right hand off, and brought it to her. After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was wanting. “Have you not been killing, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar?” said he. “Yes,” said the girl. “That’s well,” said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig’s heart. The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed."
"In the morning when the three army-surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying. Then she brought it out of the cupboard, and the first fixed the thief’s hand on and smeared it with his salve, and it grew to his arm directly. The second took the cat’s eyes and put them in his own head."
"The third fixed the pig’s heart firm in the place where his own had been, and the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he had never yet seen such a thing as that done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to everyone. Then they paid their bill, and travelled farther."
"As they were on their way, the one with the pig’s heart did not stay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran to it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do. The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest. The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, “Comrades, what is the matter? I don’t see at all. Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.” Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn. They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. The one with the thief’s hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it. One of them saw this, and said, “Comrade, what art thou about? Thou must not steal shame on thee!” “Eh,” said he, “but how can I stop myself? My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.”"
"After this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand. All at once the one with the cat’s eyes awoke, aroused the others, and said. “Brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice running about there?” The two sat up, but could see nothing. Then said he, “Things are not right with us, we have not got back again what is ours. We must return to the innkeeper, he has deceived us.” They went back therefore, the next morning, and told the host they had not got what was their own again; that the first had a thief’s hand, the second cat’s eyes, and the third a pig’s heart. The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame for that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the three coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back. Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or they would set his house on fire. He gave them what he had, and whatever he could get together, and the three went away with it. It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they would rather have had their own proper organs."
119 The Seven Swabians
"Seven Swabians were once together. The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds. But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them."
"This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last. Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner. Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body. “Hark! hark!” cried he to his comrades, “Good heavens! I hear a drum.” Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, “Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches.” At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow. “Oh dear! Oh dear!”"
screamed Master Schulz. “Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!”
"The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, “If you surrender, I surrender too! If you surrender, I surrender too!” At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it. Then they journeyed onwards. The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first. Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun. Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open. All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do. For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole. So they said, “We must go through a great and dangerous struggle. Boldly ventured, is half won,” and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind. Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,"
"“Strike home, in every Swabian’s name, Or else I wish ye may be lame.”"
"But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,"
"“Thunder and lightning, it’s fine to prate, But for dragon-hunting thou’rt aye too late.”"
"Michal cried,"
"One eye, sleepest thou?”"
"until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, “One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.” So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”"
"Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, “This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.” So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.” But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.” Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?”"
"but then, instead of singing,"
"“Three eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,"
"“Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"and sang all the time,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?"
"Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.” And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, “Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.” Then the envious mother cried, “Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead."
"When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears."
"Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, “Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?” “Have I not reason to weep?” she answered. “The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.” The wise woman said, “Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.” Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, “Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don’t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.” Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you can have it.” So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do."
"Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, “Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.”"
"One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, “Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.” One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, “I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.” The sisters cried, “You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?” But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly."
"It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. “Quick, Two-eyes,” cried the two sisters, “creep under this, and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.” Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.” They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-eyes, come forth.” Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.” “Yes,” replied Two-eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight."
"Then said the knight, “Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?”"
"“Alas!” answered Two-eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.” So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father’s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart’s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. “The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?” But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her."
"Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth."
"shell; she would go, she would carry his valuable to this man,"
"our relative-in-law. Next day, he would yomelu; he would catch"
"a pig, he would break off a bunch of betel-nut, he would cut"
"sugar cane, bananas, he would fill the baskets with food, and"
spike the coco-nut on a multi-forked piece of wood. By-and-by
he would bring it. Our house would be filled up. Later on we
"would make a distribution of the bananas, of the sugar cane, of"
"the betel-nut. We give it to our helpers. We sit, we sit (i.e.,"
"we wait); at harvest time he brings yams, he karibudaboda (he"
"gives the payment of that name), the necklace. He would bring"
the food and fill out our yam house.
"This narrative, like many pieces of native information, needs certain"
"corrections of perspective. In the first place, events here succeed one"
another with a rapidity quite foreign to the extremely leisurely way in
which natives usually accomplish such a lengthy process as the making
"of a katudababile. The amount of food which, in the usual manner,"
is enumerated over and over again in this narrative would probably
"not be exaggerated, for--such is native economy--a man who makes a"
necklace to order would get about twice as much or even more for it
"than it would fetch in any other transaction. On the other hand,"
it must be remembered that what is represented here as the final
"payment, the karibudaboda, is nothing else but the normal filling up"
"of the yam house, always done by a man's relations-in-law. None the"
"less, in a year in which a katudababile would be made, the ordinary"
yearly harvest gift would be styled the 'karibudaboda payment for
"the necklace.' The giving of the necklace to the wife, who afterwards"
"carries it to her brother or kinsman, is also characteristic of the"
relation between relatives-in-law.
In Sinaketa and Vakuta only the necklaces made of bigger shell and
commences later. Their sensible properties and medical activity are
"impaired by long keeping. They should be of a green color, and free from"
"mustiness. The root has a feeble earthy odor. Though sweetish at first,"
it has afterwards the same effect as the leaves upon the mouth and
"fauces. It shrinks much in drying and becomes darker, but does not lose"
"its acrimony. Those parcels, whether of leaves or roots, should always"
be rejected which are destitute of this property. Aconite root is
"officially described as being “slenderly conical, 4 to 10 cm. long, 10"
to 20 mm. thick at the crown; occasionally split; longitudinally
wrinkled; dark brown and marked with coarse whitish root-scars; fracture
"short, horny or mealy; internally whitish or light brown; the cambium"
"zone irregular and 5 to 7-angled; odor very slight; taste sweetish, soon"
"becoming acrid and developing a tingling sensation, followed by"
numbness.”
Preparations of the leaves are not official in the U. S. P. The root is
five times stronger than the leaves.
CONSTITUENTS.--The alkaloid representing the action of the drug is
"aconitine, which is precipitated by ammonia from an aqueous solution of"
"an alcoholic extract of the root of various species. It is a colorless,"
"crystalline or amorphous, gray powder, almost insoluble in water, and"
"soluble in 22 parts of alcohol, in 44 parts of ether and 1 part of"
"chloroform. Its salts are soluble in water. Aconitine or its solutions,"
"unless very dilute, are too poisonous to be tasted."
"Commercial preparations vary in purity and strength, and since it is"
extremely poisonous its internal administration is undesirable.
"Pseudo-aconitine, aconitine and other alkaloids in combination with"
"aconitic acid have been obtained from aconite, but their identity and"
chemistry are uncertain.
says:
“I remember well the feeling roused in my mind at the mention or sight
of the name _Lucifer_ during the early years of my life. It stood for
"me as the name of a being stupendous, dreadful in moral deformity,"
"lurid, hideous and mighty. I remember the surprise which, when I had"
"grown somewhat older and began to study Latin, I came upon the name in"
Virgil where it means _light-bringer_--the herald of the Sun.”
Plato has said: “That the End of Education should be the training by
suitable habits of the Instincts of Virtue in the Child.”
"About two thousand years later, Sir Philip Sidney, in his “Defence of"
"Poesy,” says: “The final end of learning is to draw and lead us to so"
"high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clay"
"lodgings, can be capable of.”"
And yet it is neither the Greek philosopher nor the Elizabethan poet
that makes the every-day application of these principles; but we have
"a hint of this application from the Pueblo tribe of Indians, of whom"
Lummis tells us the following:
“There is no duty to which a Pueblo child is trained in which he has
to be content with a bare command: Do this. For each he learns a
fairy-tale designed to explain how children first came to know that
"it was right to ‘do this,’ and detailing the sad results that befell"
"those who did otherwise. Some tribes have regular story-tellers, men"
who have devoted a great deal of time to learning the myths and stories
"of their people and who possess, in addition to a good memory, a vivid"
"imagination. The mother sends for one of these, and having prepared a"
"feast for him, she and her little brood, who are curled up near her,"
"await the Fairy Stories of the dreamer, who after his feast and smoke"
"about themselves, even to quite trifling and unnecessary details. And,"
"of course, each one thinks himself or herself the ONLY or the chief"
"'celebrity' in London, or, for that matter, in the world. I have always"
"to tone down the egotistical part of it a little, especially with"
"authors, for if I were to write out exactly what THEY separately say of"
"their contemporaries, it would be simply frightful! They would be all"
at daggers drawn in no time! I assure you 'interviewing' is often a
"most delicate and difficult business!"""
"""Would it were altogether impossible!"" said Villiers heartily--""But as"
"long as there is a plethora of little authors, and a scarcity of great"
"ones, so long, I suppose, must it continue--for little men love"
"notoriety, and great ones shrink from it, just in the same way that"
"good women like flattery, while bad ones court it. I hope you don't"
bear me any grudge because I consider my friend Alwyn both good and
"great, and resent the idea of his being placed, no matter with what"
"excellent intention soever, on the level of the small and mean?"""
The lady surveyed him with a twinkle of latent approval in her
pale-colored eyes.
"""Not in the least!"" she replied in a tone of perfect good-humor. ""On"
"the contrary, I rather admire your frankness! Still, I think, that as"
"matters stand nowadays, you are very odd,--and I suppose your friend is"
"odd too,--but, of course, there must be exceptions to every rule. At"
"the same time, you should recollect that, in many people's opinion, to"
"be 'interviewed' is one of the chiefest rewards of fame!--"" Villiers"
"shrugged his shoulders expressively. ""Oh, yes, it seems a poor reward"
"to you, no doubt,""--she continued smilingly,--""but there are no end of"
"authors who would do anything to secure the notoriety of it! Now,"
"suppose that, after all, Mr. Alwyn DOES care to submit to the"
"operation, you will let me know, won't you?"""
"blood excited them, and they besprinkled the statue of the goddess and her"
"votaries with it, or even drank it. Finally a prophetic delirium would"
"overcome them, and they foretold the future."
"This ferocious worship aroused curiosity at first, but it never gained"
great consideration. It appears that the Cappadocian Bellona joined the
"number of divinities that were subordinated to the _Magna Mater_ and, as"
"the texts put it, became her follower (_pedisequa_).[12] The brief"
"popularity enjoyed by this exotic _Mâ_ at the beginning of our era shows,"
"nevertheless, the growing {55} influence of the Orient, and of the"
religions of Asia Minor in particular.
After the establishment of the empire the apprehensive distrust in which
the worship of Cybele and Attis had been held gave way to marked favor and
the original restrictions were withdrawn. Thereafter Roman citizens were
"chosen for _archigalli_, and the holidays of the Phrygian deities were"
solemnly and officially celebrated in Italy with even more pomp than had
been displayed at Pessinus.
"According to Johannes Lydus, the Emperor Claudius was the author of this"
change. Doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of the statement
"made by this second-rate compiler, and it has been claimed that the"
transformation in question took place under the Antonines. This is
erroneous. The testimony of inscriptions corroborates that of the Byzantine
"writer.[13] In spite of his love of archaism, it was Claudius who permitted"
"this innovation to be made, and we believe that we can divine the motives"
of his action.
"Under his predecessor, Caligula, the worship of Isis had been authorized"
after a long resistance. Its stirring festivities and imposing processions
gained considerable popularity. This competition must have been disastrous
"to the priests of the _Magna Mater_, who were secluded in their temple on"
room.
"When Grey awoke next morning, the sun was shining; a frugal but"
sufficient meal was spread upon the table; a fire was blazing cheerily
"upon the hearth; and there was the Old Lion, with his manuscript before"
"him, muttering beneath his breath, and throwing out his hand in telling"
"gesture, making so fine a picture with his leonine face and shaggy mane"
of hair that Grey watched him awhile in silence before advancing.
"""Good-morrow, and welcome to you, my son,"" was the greeting be received."
"""I have had a beautiful night.  The muse was hot upon me.  The rounded"
periods seemed to flow from my pen without effort. Let us to breakfast
"first; then shall you read what I have written, and together we will"
"amend it, if need be.  But first shall you remove hither from that"
unsavoury lodging of which you did speak. Here is money: pay your
"reckoning, and bring hither any goods and chattels you may value.  We"
"must dwell together these next weeks.  We will work hard, and before the"
week closes I will have some manager here to listen to our rendering of
this scene.  We will have the world crowding to see and hear us
"yet!—King Fortune, I salute thee, and I thank thee from my heart that"
"thou didst send this goodly youth to me, and didst prompt my heart from"
"the first to take note of him and seek his friendship."""
"The removal of Grey’s simple belongings took but little time, and lucky"
did he feel himself to be able to call this comfortable abode his home.
A small attic upon the same floor of the house made him a sleeping
"chamber at very small cost, and his days were spent in the sunny south"
"garret, which was called the Lion’s Den; and there they studied, and"
"wrote, and rehearsed this eulogy upon the Duke, and the prowess of the"
"English arms, the old man introducing here and there allusions and"
"innuendoes which Grey scarcely understood, but which Wylde declared"
"would bring down thunders of applause from the house—as, indeed, proved"
You never struck your flag to _us_; you'll go to England free.'[43]
"'Twas the sixth day of October, Seventeen-hundred-seventy-nine,"
"A year when nations ventured against us to combine,"
"_Quebec_ was burned and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;"
But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.
"And you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind"
Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;
"Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,"
And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.”
This poem is specially to be commended because it is another example of
the finer qualities which are developed in war.[44]
"Now, such a ballad as this, which, being pure narrative, could"
"easily be introduced into the story-hour, would do as much to foster"
"“_L'entente cordiale_” as any processions or civic demonstrations,"
or lavish international exchange of hospitality. It has also a great
practical application now that we are encouraging visits between
English and foreign children. Let us hope the _entente cordiale_ will
not stop at France. There must be many such instances of magnanimity
"and generosity displayed to us by other nations, and it might be"
well to collect them and include them among stories for the school
curriculum.
"But in all our stories, in order to produce desired effects we must"
"refrain from holding, as Burroughs says, “a brief for either side,” and"
we must leave the decision of the children free in this matter.[45]
"In a review of Ladd's _Psychology_ in the “Academy,” we find a passage"
which refers as much to the story as to the novel:
"to the trust, but their owners were bound at all times to allow a normal"
"head of water when it was called for. Instead of doing this now, they"
played all sorts of tricks on Bainbridge. When he particularly needed
"plenty of water to float his drive past a shallow or narrow spot, the"
"gates were arbitrarily shut down, and the drive hung up. Again, at one"
point where the middle part of the drive had jammed and the crew were
"occupied in picking it instead of using dynamite, the gates which Bob"
"had personally closed were raised without warning, letting down a flood"
"of water which struck the jam with terrific force. It gave instantly,"
"carrying three men with it. Two managed to escape by a miracle, and were"
dragged ashore with broken limbs; the other was crushed and drowned.
After that Bainbridge placed guards at the various dams with
instructions to shoot any one who attempted to interfere with them. This
"resulted in a terrific outcry on the part of Crane’s underlings, an"
"appeal to the law, injunctions, and all that sort of thing. To which"
"Bainbridge paid no attention whatever. He went on his way calmly,"
"knowing well that they could not stop him in this manner, and willing to"
put up with the inconvenience that would follow when it was all over and
he had returned to civilization.
Mr. Wolcott Sears continued his fishing trip along the route the
"lumbermen were following, and began frequently to appear in camp for an"
"evening pipe with Bainbridge. One evening they had a private conference,"
"which lasted until the small hours, and the Boston capitalist finally"
"departed, leaving Bainbridge apparently much gratified."
The crew was with Bob to a man. By this time they had gathered an
"inkling of the plot against the firm, and of the stakes involved. Men"
had strayed into camp telling of the extraordinary reductions made by
the trust in the price of manufactured lumber. Large sales had resulted
"to various parties, report said, thus preventing Bainbridge & Tweedy, as"
The senses are open for the nice observation of the curious. Though
"Erasmus does not know that need of proving the secrets of nature, which"
"inspired a Leonardo da Vinci, a Paracelsus, a Vesalius, he is also, by"
"his keen observation, a child of his time. For peculiarities in the"
habits and customs of nations he has an open eye. He notices the gait of
"Swiss soldiers, how dandies sit, how Picards pronounce French. He"
notices that in old pictures the sitters are always represented with
"half-closed eyes and tightly shut lips, as signs of modesty, and how"
"some Spaniards still honour this expression in life, while German art"
"prefers lips pouting as for a kiss. His lively sense of anecdote, to"
"which he gives the rein in all his writings, belongs here."
"And, in spite of all his realism, the world which Erasmus sees and"
"renders, is not altogether that of the sixteenth century. Everything is"
veiled by Latin. Between the author's mind and reality intervenes his
antique diction. At bottom the world of his mind is imaginary. It is a
subdued and limited sixteenth-century reality which he reflects.
Together with its coarseness he lacks all that is violent and direct in
"his times. Compared with the artists, with Luther and Calvin, with the"
"statesmen, the navigators, the soldiers and the scientists, Erasmus"
confronts the world as a recluse. It is only the influence of Latin. In
"spite of all his receptiveness and sensitiveness, Erasmus is never fully"
"in contact with life. All through his work not a bird sings, not a wind"
rustles.
But that reserve or fear of directness is not merely a negative quality.
It also results from a consciousness of the indefiniteness of the ground
"of all things, from the awe of the ambiguity of all that is. If Erasmus"
"so often hovers over the borderline between earnestness and mockery, if"
"he hardly ever gives an incisive conclusion, it is not only due to"
"cautiousness, and fear to commit himself. Everywhere he sees the"
"shadings, the blending of the meaning of words. The terms of things are"
"refusal of Buddhists to take life. 'Buddhists,' they say, 'believe in"
the transmigration of souls. They believe that when a man dies his soul
"may go into a beast. You could not expect him to kill a bull, when"
perchance his grandfather's soul might inhabit there.' This is their
"explanation, this is the way they put two and two together to make five."
"They know that Buddhists believe in transmigration, they know that"
"Buddhists do not like to take life, and therefore one is the cause of"
the other.
I have mentioned this explanation to Burmans while talking of the
"subject, and they have always laughed at it. They had never heard of it"
before. It is true that it is part of their great theory of life that
"the souls of men have risen from being souls of beasts, and that we may"
so relapse if we are not careful. Many stories are told of cases that
"have occurred where a man has been reincarnated as an animal, and where"
what is now the soul of a man used to live in a beast. But that makes no
"difference. Whatever a man may have been, or may be, he is a man now;"
"whatever a beast may have been, he is a beast now. Never suppose that a"
"Burman has any other idea than this. To him men are men, and animals are"
"animals, and men are far the higher. But he does not deduce from this"
that man's superiority gives him permission to illtreat or to kill
animals. It is just the reverse. It is because man is so much higher
than the animal that he can and must observe towards animals the very
"greatest care, feel for them the very greatest compassion, be good to"
them in every way he can. The Burman's motto should be _Noblesse
"oblige_; he knows the meaning, if he knows not the words."
For the Burman's compassion towards animals goes very much farther than
a mere reluctance to kill them. Although he has no command on the
"subject, it seems to him quite as important to treat animals well during"
their lives as to refrain from taking those lives. His refusal to take
life he shares with the Hindu; his perpetual care and tenderness to all
from floor to ceiling of this very Hall. And beyond that arch the
"Laboratory merges imperceptibly into the garden, which is the true"
"laboratory for the study of Life. There the creepers, the plants and the"
"trees are played upon by their natural environments,--sunlight and wind,"
and the chill at midnight under the vault of starry space. There are
"other surroundings also, where they will be subjected to chromatic"
"action of different lights, to invisible rays, to electrified ground or"
thunder-charged atmosphere. Everywhere they will transcribe in their own
script the history of their experience. From this lofty point of
"observation, sheltered by the trees, the student will watch this"
"panorama of life. Isolated from all distractions, he will learn to"
attune himself with Nature; the obscuring veil will be lifted and he
will gradually come to see how community throughout the great ocean of
life outweighs apparent dissimilarity. Out of discord he will realise
the great harmony.
THE OUTLOOK
These are the dreams that wove a network round my wakeful life for many
"years past. The outlook is endless, for the goal is at infinity. The"
realisation cannot be through one life or one fortune but through the
co-operation of many lives and many fortunes. The possibility of a
fuller expansion will depend on very large endowments. But a beginning
"must be made, and this is the genesis of the foundation of this"
Institute. I came with nothing and shall return as I came; if something
"is accomplished in the interval, that would indeed be a privilege. What"
"I have I will offer, and one who had shared with me the struggles and"
"hardships that had to be faced, has wished to bequeath all that is hers"
for the same object. In all my struggling efforts I have not been
"altogether solitary while the world doubted, there had been a few, now"
"in the City of Silence, who never wavered in their trust."
"the article which is sold under the name of sago in our groceries, but"
"is mealy, tough, and almost elastic. The natives consider it a great"
"delicacy, and bake it into little cakes, or boil it into dumplings."
The main fleet of the Dobuans started some time in the second half of
"March from their villages, and went first to the beach of Sarubwoyna,"
"where they held a ceremonial distribution of food, eguya'i, as it is"
"called in Dobu. Then, offering the pokala to Aturamo'a and Atu'a'ine,"
"they sailed by way of Sanaroa and Tewara, passing the tabooed rock"
"of Gurewaya to the Amphletts. The wind was light and changeable,"
weak S.W. breezes prevailing. The progress of this stage of the
journey must have been very slow. The natives must have spent a
"few nights on the intermediate islands and sandbanks, a few canoes'"
crews camping at one spot.
"At that time I had already succeeded in reaching the Amphletts, and"
"had been busy for two or three weeks doing ethnographic work, though"
"not very successfully; for, as I have already once or twice remarked,"
the natives here are very bad informants. I knew of course that the
"Dobuan fleet was soon to come, but as my experience had taught me to"
"mistrust native time-tables and fixtures of date, I did not expect"
"them to be punctual. In this, however, I was mistaken. On a Kula"
"expedition, when the dates are once fixed, the natives make real and"
strenuous efforts to keep to them. In the Amphletts the people were
"busy preparing for the expedition, because they had the intention of"
joining the Dobuans and proceeding with them to the Trobriands. A few
"canoes went to the mainland to fetch sago, pots were being mustered and"
"made ready for stowing away, canoes were overhauled. When the small"
"expedition returned from the mainland with sago, after a week or so,"
"a sagali (in Amphlettan: madare), that is, a ceremonial distribution"
"of food was held on the neighbouring island, Nabwageta."
"preparation for his higher and better destiny. The cultured, the"
"scholarly, the ultra-refined, may live well and uprightly by their"
"'moral sense,'--if they so choose, provided they have some great ideal"
"to measure themselves by,--but even these, without faith in God, may"
"sometimes slip, and fall into deeper depths of ruin than they dreamed"
"of, when self-centred on those heights of virtue where they fancied"
"themselves exempt from danger."""
"He paused,--there was a curious stillness in the room,--many eyes were"
"lowered, and M. le Duc's composure was evidently not quite so absolute"
as usual.
"""Taken at its best""--he continued--""the world alone is certainly not"
worth fighting for;--we see the fact exemplified every day in the cases
"of those who, surrounded by all that a fair fortune can bestow upon"
"them, deliberately hurl themselves out of existence by their own free"
"will and act,--indeed, suicide is a very general accompaniment of"
"Agnosticism. And self-slaughter, though it may be called madness, is"
"far more often the result of intellectual misery."""
"""Of course, too much learning breeds brain disease""--remarked Dr."
"Mudley sententiously--""but only in weak subjects,--and in my opinion"
"the weak are better out of the world. We've no room for them nowadays."""
"""You say truly, sir,""--replied Alwyn--""we have no room for them, and no"
"patience! They show themselves feeble, and forthwith the strong oppress"
"them;--they can hope for little comfort here, and less help. It is"
"well, therefore, that some of these 'weak' should still believe in God,"
since they can certainly pin no faith on the justice of their
fellow-man! But I cannot agree with you that much learning breeds brain
disease. Provided the learning be accompanied by a belief in the
"Supreme Wisdom,--provided every step of study be taken upward toward"
"fall."""
"He showed no interest whatever in the new plant, refusing even to look"
it over or to express an opinion upon the progress of the work; so they
"sent him out to the ship, where for days he remained in a toad-like"
"lethargy, basking in the sun, sleeping three-fourths of the time and"
spending his waking hours in repeating the awful tale of his
disgraceful peonage.
"To unload the machinery, particularly the heavier pieces, was by no"
"means a simple matter, owing to the furious tides that set in and out"
of the Kalvik River. The first mishap occurred during the trip on which
"the boilers were towed in, and it looked to Boyd less like an accident"
than a carefully planned move to cripple him at one stroke. The other
ships were busily discharging and the roadstead was alive with small
"craft of various kinds, when the huge boilers were swung over the side"
of _The Bedford Castle_ and blocked into position for the journey to
the shore. George and a half-dozen of his men went along with the load
"while Emerson remained on the ship. They were just well under way when,"
"either by the merest chance or by malicious design, several of the"
rival Company's towboats moored to the neighboring ships cast off. The
anchorage was crowded and a boiling six-mile tide made it difficult at
best to avoid collision.
"Hearing a confused shouting to shoreward, Boyd ran to the rail in time"
to see one of the Company tugs at the head of a string of towboats
bearing down ahead of the current directly upon his own slow-moving
lighter. Already it was so close at hand as to make disaster seem
inevitable. He saw Balt wave his arms furiously and heard him bellow
"profane warnings while the fishermen scurried about excitedly, but"
still the tug held to its course. Boyd raised his voice in a wild
"alarm, but had they heard him there was nothing they could have done."
and loved him. And so it was without the slightest feeling of misgiving
that she watched her lover quickly take down his coat and hat from the
"peg on the wall and start for the door. On the other hand, it must have"
required not a little courage on the man's part to have torn himself
"away from this lovely, if unconventional, creature, just as he was"
"beginning to love truly and appreciate her. But, then, Johnson was a man"
of no mean determination!
"Not daring to trust himself to words, Johnson paused to look back over"
his shoulder at the Girl before plunging forth into the night. But on
opening the door all the multitudinous wild noises of the forests
"reached his ears: Sounds of whispering and rocking storm-tossed pines,"
"sounds of the wind making the rounds of the deep canyon below them,"
"sounds that would have made the blood run cold of a man more daring,"
"even, than himself. Like one petrified he stood blinded, almost, by the"
"great drifts of snow that were being driven into the room, while the"
"cabin rocked and shook and the roof cracked and snapped, the lights"
"flickered, smoked, or sent their tongues of fire upward towards the"
"ceiling, the curtains swayed like pendants in the air, and while"
"baskets, boxes, and other small furnishings of the cabin were blown in"
every direction.
But it was the Girl's quick presence of mind that saved them from being
"buried, literally, under the snow. In an instant she had rushed past him"
"and closed both the outer and inner doors of the cabin; then, going over"
"to the window, she tried to look through the heavily frosted panes; but"
"the falling of the sleet and snow, striking the window like fine shot,"
made it impossible for her to see more than a few inches away.
"""Why, it's the first time I knew that it--"" She cut her sentence short"
"and ended with: ""That's the way we git it up here! Look! Look!"""
"put by a ruler. The same would apply to a combination of signs, one of the"
"fundamental principles of divination being--once favorable, always"
favorable.
Among the birth-omen reports we have one containing a historical reference
of unusual interest[30].
'If the foetus is male and female--omen of Azag-Bau who ruled the
land. The king's country will be seized.
"If a foetus is male and female, without testicles, a son of the"
palace[31] will rule the land or will assert himself against the
king.'
"We must assume in this case that a monstrosity has been born, having"
partly male and partly female organs. The priest by way of interpretation
"notes a series of signs registered in the collections, all prognosticating"
"an abnormal state of affairs--a woman on the throne, captivity, seizure"
of the throne by an usurper and revolt. We frequently find in the
"collections several interpretations registered in this way,--a valuable"
indication of the manner in which these collections were compiled by the
priests from a variety of documents before them. The name of this female
"ruler, hitherto known only from this report and from a list of proper"
"names in which Azag-Bau occurred, has now turned up in an important list"
"of early dynasties ruling in the Euphratean Valley, discovered and"
"published by Scheil[32]. We may conclude, therefore, that at the time that"
"Azag-Bau sat on the throne or shortly before, such a monstrosity actually"
"came to light. As an unusual occurrence it presaged something unusual, and"
was naturally associated with the extraordinary circumstance of a woman
mounting the throne. Azag-Bau according to the newly discovered list is
the founder of a dynasty ruling in Erech as a centre and whose date
appears to be somewhere between 2800 and 3000 B. C.--possibly even
knowledge. They will announce to an audience of some fifteen hundred
"people, the new discoveries made here, which will be demonstrated for"
the first time before the public. We shall thus maintain continuously
the highest aim of a great Seat of Learning by taking active part in the
_advancement_ and diffusion of knowledge. Through the regular
"publication of the Transactions of the Institute, these Indian"
contributions will reach the whole world. The discoveries made will thus
become public property. No patents will ever be taken. The spirit of our
national culture demands that we should for ever be free from the
desecration of utilising knowledge for personal gain. Besides the
"regular staff there will be a selected number of scholars, who by their"
"work have shown special aptitude, and who would devote their whole life"
to the pursuit of research. They will require personal training and
their number must necessarily be limited. But it is not the quantity
but quality that is of essential importance.
"It is my further wish, that as far as the limited accommodation would"
"permit, the facilities of this Institute should be available to workers"
from all countries. In this I am attempting to carry out the traditions
"of my country, which so far back as twenty-five centuries ago, welcomed"
"all scholars from different parts of the world, within the precincts of"
"its ancient seats of learning, at Nalanda and at Taxilla."
THE SURGE OF LIFE
"With this widened outlook, we shall not only maintain the highest"
traditions of the past but also serve the world in nobler ways. We shall
"be at one with it in feeling the common surgings of life, the common"
"love for the good, the true and the beautiful. In this Institute, this"
"Study and Garden of Life, the claim of art has not been forgotten, for"
"the artist has been working with us, from foundation to pinnacle, and"
"short, people of all classes of society, to find their national and"
favorite devotions in it. As a matter of fact no other Anatolian god could
maintain his independence side by side with the deities of Pessinus.[24]
We do not know the internal development of the {61} Phrygian mysteries
sufficiently to give details of the addition of each individual part. But
we can prove that in the course of time certain religions were added to the
one that had been practised in the temple of the Palatine ever since the
republic.
"In the inscriptions of the fourth century, Attis bears the cognomen of"
_menotyrannus_. At that time this name was undoubtedly understood to mean
"""lord of the months,"" because Attis represented the sun who entered a new"
sign of the zodiac every month.[25] But that was not the original meaning
"of the term. ""_Mèn tyrannus_"" appears with quite a different meaning in"
"many inscriptions found in Asia Minor. _Tyrannos_ ([Greek: Turannos]),"
"""lord,"" is a word taken by the Greeks from the Lydian, and the honorable"
"title of ""tyrant"" was given to Mèn, an old barbarian divinity worshiped by"
all Phrygia and surrounding regions.[26] The Anatolian tribes from Caria to
the remotest mountains of Pontus worshiped a lunar god under that name who
"was supposed to rule not only the heavens but also the underworld, because"
the moon was frequently brought into connection with the somber kingdom of
the dead. The growth of plants and the increase of cattle and poultry were
"ascribed to his celestial influence, and the villagers invoked his"
protection for their farms and their district. They also placed their rural
burial grounds under the safeguard of this king of shadows. No god enjoyed
greater popularity in the country districts.
This powerful divinity penetrated into Greece at an early period. Among the
"mixed populations of the Ægean seaports, in the Piræus, at Rhodes, Delos"
"and Thasos, religious associations for his worship were {62} founded. In"
"Attica the presence of the cult can be traced back to the fourth century,"
"farm, a few slices of sausage, and a big cup of frothing chocolate"
topped with whipped cream. The scene that spread before her was
"idyllic, from a bucolic point of view. The beech woods of Tervueren"
shut out any horizon of town activity; black and white cows were
"being driven out to pasture, a flock of geese with necks raised"
"vertically waggled sedately along their own chosen path, a little"
disturbed and querulous over the arrival of a stranger; turkey hens
"and their half-grown poults and a swelling, strutting turkey cock, a"
peacock that had already lost nearly all his tail and therefore
"declined combat with the turkey and was, moreover, an isolated"
bachelor; guinea-fowls scratching and running about alternately; and
plump cocks and hens of mixed breed covered most of the ground in
"the adjacent farm yard and the turf of an apple orchard, where the"
fruit was already reddening under the August sun. Pigeons circled
against the sky with the distinct musical notes struck out by their
"wings, or cooed and cooed round the dove cots. The dairy women of"
the farm laughed and sang and called out to one another in Flemish
and Wallon rough chaff about their men-folk who were called to the
Colours. There was nothing suggestive here of any coming tragedy.
This was the morning of the 13th of August. For three more days
"Vivie lived deliriously, isolated from the world. She took new books"
"to the shade of the forest, and a rug on which she could repose, and"
"read there with avidity, read also all the newspapers her mother had"
"brought over from England, tried to master the events which had so"
rapidly and irresistibly plunged Europe into War. Were the Germans
"to blame, she asked herself? Of course they were, technically, in"
invading Belgium and in forcing this war on France. But were they
not being surrounded by a hostile Alliance? Was not this hostility
on the part of Servia towards Austria stimulated by Russia in order
to forestal the Central Powers by a Russian occupation of
Constantinople? Why should the Russian Empire be allowed to stretch
study.
I almost smiled with self-contempt when I thought how I had set out the
"previous morning in order to conquer my old world, and how it was now"
receding further and further from me. I looked at the other readers.
"They were mostly old men, engrossed in their studies, just as they had"
been in peace time. I wondered what they thought about the war. I knew
they would not allow it to disturb them much or interfere with their
"studies and their sleep. And after all, why should they care? It was"
only youth that was being slaughtered on the battlefields and not old
age.
The sleepy dullness of the museum became unbearable and I walked out
into the street.
"I spent the evening with a member of the National Liberal Club, an"
"intimate family friend, whose intellectual arrogance was one of the evil"
"memories of my childhood, when many eager impulses and aspirations had"
been turned to bitterness by his lofty depreciation and his
imperturbable assumption of superiority based on maturer years and
experience. Having at different times received material kindnesses at
"his hands, I knew I could not tell him what I really thought, and the"
"prospect of meeting him filled me with uneasiness. Moreover, in his"
presence I felt a kind of pride which I did not usually feel in the
presence of others--a pride that forbade me to express any sentiment or
to reveal my inner mind. And yet my inner mind was clamouring
intolerably for revelation. I realized the advantage he would derive
"from his simple attitude and from his lack of mental integrity, which"
enabled him to ignore any considerations that did not conform to his
"preconceived notions, and I realized the disadvantage of my complex"
"attitude, made up as it was of so many conflicting impulses, at war with"
each other and with the world around me.
"had been caught in an ambuscade and many of them killed, although the"
Spaniards had at last turned and fled. The pirates killed most of their
"prisoners, but kept a few to be questioned by L'Ollonais so as to find"
some other way to the town. As he could get no information out of these
"men, the Frenchman drew his cutlass and with it cut open the breast of one"
"of the Spaniards, and pulling out his still beating heart he began to bite"
"and gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the other"
"prisoners, ""I will serve you all alike, if you show me not another way."""
"Shortly after this, many of the buccaneers broke away from L'Ollonais and"
"sailed under the command of Moses van Vin, the second in command."
"L'Ollonais, in his big ship, sailed to the coast of Honduras, but ran his"
vessel on a sand-bank and lost her. While building a new but small craft
"on one of the Las Pertas Islands, they cultivated beans and other"
"vegetables, and also wheat, for which they baked bread in portable ovens"
which these French buccaneers carried about with them. It took them six
"months to build their long-boat, and when it was finished it would not"
carry more than half the number of buccaneers. Lots were drawn to settle
who should sail and who remain behind. L'Ollonais steered the boat towards
"Cartagena, but was caught by the Indians, as described by Esquemeling."
"""Here suddenly his ill-fortune assailed him, which of a long time had been"
"reserved for him as a punishment due to the multitude of horrible crimes,"
which in his licentious and wicked life he had committed. For God
"Almighty, the time of His divine justice being now already come, had"
appointed the Indians of Darien to be the instruments and executioners
"thereof."""
"These ""instruments of God,"" having caught L'Ollonais, tore him in pieces"
"alive, throwing his body limb by limb into the fire and his ashes into the"
"air, to the intent ""no trace nor memory might remain of such an infamous"
"inhuman creature."""
"on this subject, for the two following experiences gathered from the"
streets which bear indirectly on the subject of story-telling:
"Mrs. Glover was visiting a sick woman in a very poor neighbourhood,"
"and found, sitting on the doorstep of the house, two children, holding"
"something tightly grasped in their little hands, and gazing with much"
expectancy towards the top of the street. She longed to know what they
"were doing, but not being one of those unimaginative and tactless"
"folk who rush headlong into the mysteries of children's doings, she"
passed them at first in silence. It was only when she found them still
in the same silent and expectant posture half-an-hour later that
she said tentatively: “I wonder whether you would tell me what you
"are doing here?” After some hesitation, one of them said, in a shy"
"voice: “We're waitin' for the barrer.” It then transpired that, once a"
"week, a vegetable-and flower-cart was driven through this particular"
"street, on its way to a more prosperous neighbourhood, and on a few"
"red-letter days, a flower, or a sprig, or even a root sometimes fell"
out of the back of the cart; and those two little children were waiting
"there in hope, with their hands full of soil, ready to plant anything"
"which might by golden chance fall that way, in their secret garden of"
oyster-shells.
This seems to me as charming a fairy-tale as any that our books can
supply.
Another time Mrs. Glover was collecting the pennies for the Holiday
Fund Savings Bank from the children who came weekly to her house. She
noticed on three consecutive Mondays that one little lad deliberately
helped himself to a new envelope from her table. Not wishing to
"frighten or startle him, she allowed this to continue for some weeks,"
"and then one day, having dismissed the other children, she asked him"
quite quietly why he was taking the envelopes. At first he was very
meet with reward in life and that they end in establishing a habit of
"drudgery, but, after all, we must have poetic justice in a Fairy Story,"
"occasionally, at any rate."
"Another such story is “Jesper and the Hares.” Here, however, it is"
"not at first resourcefulness that helps the hero, but sheer kindness"
"of heart, which prompts him first to help the ants, and then to"
"show civility to the old woman, without for a moment expecting any"
"material benefit from such actions. At the end, he does win by his own"
"ingenuity and resourcefulness, and if we regret that his _trickery_"
"has such wonderful results, we must remember that the aim was to win"
"the princess for herself, and that there was little choice left him. I"
consider the end of this story to be one of the most remarkable I have
found in my long years of browsing among Fairy Tales. I should suggest
"stopping at the words: “The Tub is full,” as any addition seems to"
destroy the subtlety of the story.[28]
"Another story of this kind, admirable for children from six years and"
"upwards, is “What the Old Man does is always Right.” Here, perhaps,"
the entire lack of common sense on the part of the hero would serve
"rather as a warning than a stimulating example, but the conduct of"
the wife in excusing the errors of her foolish husband is a model of
resourcefulness.
In the story of “Hereafter--this”[29] we have just the converse: a
perfectly foolish wife shielded by a most patient and forbearing
"husband, whose tolerance and common sense save the situation."
One of the most important elements to seek in our choice of stories is
"that which tends to develop, eventually, a fine sense of humour in a"
"child. I purposely use the word “eventually,” because I realise first"
"that humour has various stages, and that seldom, if ever, can you"
"discord is signalled by the rattle of dice, thrown by Yudhisthira, the"
"pawn at stake, being the crown. Two hostile arrays are set in motion,"
mighty Kaurava armaments meeting in shock of battle the Pandava host
"with Arjuna as the leader, and Krishna as his Divine Charioteer. At the"
"supreme moment Arjuna had flung down his earthly weapon, Gandiva. It was"
then that the eternal conflict between matter and spirit was decided.
The next panel shows the outward or the material aspect of victory.
Behind a foreground of waving flags is seen the battle field of
Kurukshetra with procession of white-clad mourning women seen by fitful
lights of funeral pyres. In the last panel is seen Yudhisthira
renouncing the fruits of his victory setting out on his last journey. In
"front of him lies the vast and sombre plain and mountain peaks, faintly"
"visible by gleams of unearthly light, unlocalised but playing here and"
there. His wife and his brothers had fallen behind and dropped one by
one. There is to be no human companion in his last journey. The only
thing that stood by him and from which he had never been really
separated is Dharma or the Spirit of Righteousness.
LIFE OF ACTION
Faridpur at that time enjoyed a notoriety of being the stronghold of
"desperate characters, dacoits by land and water. My father had captured"
"single-handed one of the principal leaders, whom he sentenced to a long"
term of imprisonment. After release he came to my father and demanded
"some occupation, since the particular vocation in which he had"
specialised was now rendered impossible. My father took the unusual
"course to employ him as my special attendant to carry me, a child of"
"four, on his back to the distant village school. No nurse could be"
"tenderer than this ex-leader of lawless men, whose profession had been"
to deal out wounds and deaths. He had accepted a life of peace but he
could not altogether wipe out his old memories. He used to fill my
"relation between Literature and the Parliament House, if less close"
"than it had been, was more apparent than it is to-day, and"
distinguished Scottish judges and advocates mingled in the afternoon in
"the drawing-room, where she sat in a great arm-chair, with such men as"
Sellar and Stevenson and Grant and Shairp and Tulloch. But her
personality was the supreme bond.
"Those days are over, and with them has passed away much of what"
stimulated one to read in the _Institutes_ or the _Philosophical
Remains_. But for the historian of British philosophy Ferrier
"continues as a prominent figure. He it was who first did, what Stirling"
and Green did again at a stage later on--make a serious appeal to
thoughtful people to follow no longer the shallow rivulets down which
"the teaching of the great German thinkers had trickled to them, but to"
seek the sources. If as a guide to those sources we do not look on him
"to-day as adequate, we are not the less under a deep obligation to him"
for having been the pioneer of later guides. What Ferrier wrote about
"forty years ago has now become readily accessible, and what has been"
got by going there is in process of rapid and complete assimilation.
The opinions which were in 1856 regarded by the authorities of the Free
and United Presbyterian Churches as disqualifying Ferrier for the
"opportunity of influencing the mind of the youth of Edinburgh, from the"
"Chair of Logic and Metaphysics in succession to Sir William Hamilton,"
are regarded by the present generation of Presbyterians as the main
reliable bulwark against the attacks of unbelievers. If one may judge
"by the essays in the recent volume called _Lux Mundi_, the same"
phenomenon displays itself among the young High Church party in
England. The Time-Spirit is fond of revenges.
But even for others than the historians of the movement of Thought the
books of Ferrier remain attractive. There is about them a certain
atmosphere in which everything seems alive and fresh. Their author was
"to send her away. But the girl pleaded and cried, until at last she was"
allowed to remain.
"After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another journey, and she"
"forbade the girl, above all, to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she"
had not entered. And the girl promised her that this time she would obey
"her. But when she had been alone for some time, and had had all sorts"
"of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room, she could no"
longer resist opening the second door a little way--and swish! out flew
"the moon. When the foster-mother returned, and saw the moon had slipped"
"out, she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could keep her no"
"longer, and that now she must go. But when the girl again began to cry"
"bitterly, and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny"
"her, she was once more allowed to remain."
"After this the foster-mother wished to take another journey, and she"
"told the girl, who was now more than half-grown, that she must take"
"her request not to go, or even so much as peep into the third room,"
seriously to heart. But when the foster-mother had been away for some
"time, and the girl was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no"
"longer. ""O,"" thought she, ""how pleasant it would be to take a peep into"
"that third room!"" It is true, that at first she thought she would not do"
"it, because of her foster-mother; yet when the thought returned to her,"
"she could not hold back, after all; but decided that she should and"
must by all means take a peep. So she opened the door the least little
"bit--and swish! out flew the sun. When the foster-mother then returned,"
"and saw that the sun had flown out, she grieved greatly, and told"
the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer. The
foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before; but
"all to no avail. ""No, I must now punish you,"" said the foster-mother."

It is true that to all Orientals death is a less fearful thing than it
"is to us. I do not know what may be the cause of this, courage certainly"
has little to do with it; but it is certain that the purely physical
"fear of death, that horror and utter revulsion that seizes the majority"
"of us at the idea of death, is absent from most Orientals. And yet this"
"cannot explain it all. For fear of death, though less, is still there,"
"is still a strong influence upon their lives, and it would seem that no"
religion which ignored this great fact could become a great living
religion.
"Religion is made for man, to fit his necessities, not man for religion,"
and yet the faith of Buddhism is not concerned with death.
"Consider our faith, how much of its teaching consists of how to avoid"
"the fear of death, how much of its consolation is for the death-bed. How"
we are taught all our lives that we should live so as not to fear death;
"how we have priests and sacraments to soothe the dying man, and give"
"him hope and courage, and how the crown and summit of our creed is that"
we should die easily. And consider that in Buddhism all this is
"absolutely wanting. Buddhism is a creed of life, of conduct; death is"
"the end of that life, that is all."
"We have all seen death. We have all of us watched those who, near and"
"dear to us, go away out of our ken. There is no need for me to recall"
"the last hours of those of our faith, to bring up again the fading eye"
"and waning breath, the messages of hope we search for in our Scriptures"
"to give hope to him who is going, the assurances of religion, the cross"
held before the dying eyes.
"Many men, we are told, turn to religion at the last after a life of"
"wickedness, and a man may do so even at the eleventh hour and be saved."
"February 1917, to the students of the Presidency College on receiving"
their _Arghya_ and congratulations on the occasion of his knighthood. It
"was published in the Modern Review for March 1917--Volume XXI, p. 343."
"In your congratulations for the recent honour, you have overlooked a"
"still greater that came to me a year ago, when I was gazetted as your"
"perpetual professor, so that the tie which binds me to you is never to"
be severed. Thirty-two years ago I sought to be your teacher. For the
trust that you imposed on me could I do anything less than place before
you the highest that I knew? I never appealed to your weaknesses but
your strength. I never set before you that was easy but used all the
compulsion for the choice of the most difficult. And perhaps as a
reward for these years of effort I find all over India those who have
been my pupils occupying positions of the highest trust and
responsibility in different walks of life. I do not merely count those
who have won fame and success but I also claim many others who have
taken up the burden of life manfully and whose life of purity and
unselfishness has brought gleams of joy in suffering lives.
THE LAW UNIVERSAL
Through science I was able to teach you how the seeming veils the real;
"how though the garish lights dazzle and blind us, there are lights"
"invisible, which glow persistently after the brief flare burns out. One"
"came to realise how all matter was one, how unified all life was. In the"
various expressions of life even in the realm of thought the same
"Universal law prevails. There was no such thing as brute matter, but"
that spirit suffused matter in which it was enshrined. One also realised
"dimly a mysterious Cyclic Law of Change, seen not merely in inorganic"
matter but also in organised life and its highest manifestations. One
saw how inertness passes into the climax of activity and how that climax
Chief among the objections is the clause which would give the United
States authority to seize the vessels in time of war. It is quite
evident that this power might be employed to the complete destruction of
the Fruit Company’s trade; in fact to its practical extinction as a
business concern. A like power existing in England or Germany would not
"be of equal menace to any single company flying the flag of that nation,"
for there the government’s needs could be fully supplied by a proper
apportionment of requisitions for ships among the many companies. But
with the exceedingly restricted merchant marine of the United States the
danger of the enforcement of this right would be an ever-present menace.
It is for this reason that the Fruit Company steamers fly the British
"flag, and the American in Colon may see, as I did one day, nine great"
ocean ships in the port with only one flying the stars and stripes. The
opening of the canal will not wholly remedy this.

THE END OF THE CROCODILE]
"In all respects save the registry of its ships, however, the Fruit"
Company is a thoroughly American concern and to its operations in the
Caribbean is due much of the good feeling toward the United States which
"is observable there. In 1912 it carried 1,113,741 tons of freight, of"
"which 359,686 was general freight, carried for the public in addition"
"to company freight. This is a notable public service, profitable no"
doubt but vital to the interests of the American tropics. It owns or
"holds under leases 852,650 acres, and in 1912 carried to the United"
"States about 25,000,000 bunches of bananas, and 16,000,000 bunches to"
Great Britain and the Continent. Viewed from the standpoint of the
consumer its work certainly has operated to cheapen bananas and to place
them on sale at points where they were never before seen. The banana has
not participated in the high cost of living nor has one company
The man in the street looks out for a newspaper which may strengthen
his own party proclivities. He expects to find political questions
"discussed, but so far as religion is concerned he accepts without"
"knowing it the current convention of the pressman, and imbibes a"
semi-sceptical atmosphere without misgiving or suspicion.
"And yet, as Sir Leslie Stephen saw, every theory of duty depends upon"
Belief or Disbelief in the Divinity of Christ. We may talk of duty to
"Society, duty to the Race, duty to Posterity, duty to Civilization;"
but the plain man will recall the question of Sir Boyle Roche: “I do
"not understand, Mr. Speaker, all this talk about our duty to"
Posterity! What has Posterity ever done for us?”
You cannot control conduct by asserting that a man owes a debt to an
"abstraction which you vivify by printing it with a capital letter,"
and there remains always the question of the dying Lucretius--
“Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well.”
"The problem, then, which we have to solve is--how to arrest the"
"attention of the average man to those Christian principles, of which"
the acceptance or definite refusal will determine the course of
civilization during the next twenty years.
"The mere assertion of authority will not suffice, and men are not"
impressed in favour of Catholic doctrine simply by dignified ceremony
and Ritual. We have only to look across the English Channel to be
assured of this. Frenchmen have not been encouraged to study the
evidences of Christianity. Bishops and priests have only advertised
sceptical books by forbidding their perusal to the faithful; and as
"the devout have been instructed to live by faith, but not how to give"
"a reason for the faith which is in them, in the result M. Viviani’s"
vertebrae. In most modern fishes and in all higher vertebrates the
notochord is gradually removed as the bodies of the vertebrae are
formed about it; but in the Devonian fishes it persists through
maturity and the vertebrae remain incomplete.
THE SKELETON IS CARTILAGINOUS. This also is an embryological
"characteristic. In the Devonian fishes the vertebrae, as well as"
"the other parts of the skeleton, have not ossified, or changed to"
"bone, but remain in their primitive cartilaginous condition."
THE TAIL FIN IS VERTEBRATED. The backbone runs through the fin and
is fringed above and below with its vertical rays. In some fishes
"with vertebrated tail fins the fin is symmetric, and this seems to"
be the primitive type. In others the tail fin is unsymmetric: the
"backbone runs into the upper lobe, leaving the two lobes of"
unequal size. In most modern fishes (the teleosts) the tail fin is
"not vertebrated: the spinal column ends in a broad plate, to which"
the diverging fin rays are attached.
"But along with these embryonic characters, which were common to"
"all Devonian fishes, there were other structures in certain groups"
which foreshadowed the higher structures of the land vertebrates
"which were yet to come: air sacs which were to develop into lungs,"
and cartilaginous axes in the side fins which were a prophecy of
limbs. The vertebrates had already advanced far enough to prove
the superiority of their type of structure to all others. Their
internal skeleton afforded the best attachment for muscles and
enabled them to become the largest and most powerful creatures of
"the time. The central nervous system, with the predominance given"
"to the ganglia at the fore end of the nerve cord,--the brain,--"
already endowed them with greater energy than the invertebrates;
"and, still more important, these structures contained the"

by hunting wild cattle and drying the flesh or boucan.
"He then sailed for a few voyages as a sailor before the mast, and acted"
"with such ability and courage that the Governor of Tortuga Island,"
"Monsieur de la Place, gave him the command of a vessel and sent him out"
to seek his fortune.
"At first the young buccaneer was very successful, and he took many Spanish"
"ships, but owing to his ferocious treatment of his prisoners he soon won a"
name for cruelty which has never been surpassed. But at the height of this
"success his ship was wrecked in a storm, and, although most of the pirates"
"got ashore, they were at once attacked by a party of Spaniards, and all"
"but L'Ollonais were killed. The captain escaped, after being wounded, by"
smearing blood and sand over his face and hiding himself amongst his dead
"companions. Disguised as a Spaniard he entered the city of Campeachy,"
"where bonfires and other manifestations of public relief were being held,"
to express the joy of the citizens at the news of the death of their
"terror, L'Ollonais."
"Meeting with some French slaves, the fugitive planned with them to escape"
"in the night in a canoe, this being successfully carried out, they"
"eventually arrived back at Tortuga, the pirate stronghold. Here the"
"enterprising captain stole a small vessel, and again started off ""on the"
"account,"" plundering a village called De los Cagos in Cuba. The Governor"
of Havana receiving word of the notorious and apparently resurrected
"pirate's arrival sent a well-armed ship to take him, adding to the ship's"
"company a negro executioner, with orders to hang all the pirate crew with"
"the exception of L'Ollonais, who was to be brought back to Havana alive"
and in chains.
"Instead of the Spaniards taking the Frenchman, the opposite happened, and"
"philosophy on the one hand, or to propound theories startling in their"
unorthodoxy on the other. And still we may claim for him a place--and
"an honourable place--amongst the other Famous Scots, for the simple"
reason that after a long century of wearisome reiteration of tiresome
platitudes--platitudes which had lost their original meaning even to
"the utterers of them, and which had become misleading to those who"
heard and thought they understood--Ferrier had the courage to strike
"out new lines for himself, to look abroad for new inspiration, and to"
hand on these inspirations to those who could work them into a truly
national philosophy.
"In Scotland, where, in spite of politics, traditions are honoured to a"
"degree unknown to most other countries, family and family associations"
count for much; and in these James Ferrier was rich. His father was a
"Writer to the Signet, John Ferrier by name, whose sister was the famous"
"Scottish novelist, Susan Ferrier, authoress of _The Inheritance_,"
"_Destiny_, and _Marriage_. Susan Ferrier did for high life in Scotland"
"what Gait achieved for the humbler ranks of society, and attained to"
considerable eminence in the line of fiction which she adopted. Her
"works are still largely read, have recently been republished, and in"
their day were greatly admired by no less an authority than Sir Walter
"Scott, himself a personal friend of the authoress.[1] Ferrier's"
"grandfather, James Ferrier, also a Writer to the Signet, was a man of"
great energy of character. He acted in a business capacity for many
years both to the Duke of Argyle of the time and to various branches of
"the Clan Campbell: it was, indeed, through the influence of the Duke"
that he obtained the appointment which he held of Principal Clerk of
"Session. James Ferrier, like his daughter, was on terms of intimate"
"friendship with Sir Walter Scott, with whom he likewise was a colleague"
"in office. Scott alludes to him in his Journal as 'Uncle Adam,' the"
"name of a character in Miss Ferrier's _Inheritance_, drawn, as she"
"herself acknowledges, from her father. He died in 1829, at which time"
"was the pure voice of tragic sorrow. It is in the terrible moment when,"
"after the heroic strain of the sacrifice is over, Virginius realizes the"
"meaning of what he has done. Presumably wild with grief, he raves in"
language so startlingly akin to the ludicrous despairs of Pyramus and
"Thisbe that the modern reader, acquainted with the latter, is almost"
jarred into laughter.
"O cruel hands, O bloody knife, O man, what hast thou done?"
Thy daughter dear and only heir her vital end hath won.
"Come, fatal blade, make like despatch: come, Atropos: come, aid!"
"Strike home, thou careless arm, with speed; of death be not afraid."
"Of such eloquence we might truly say with Theseus, 'This passion, and"
"the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.'"
"In 1562 Tragedy, as we have said, took refuge in an imitation of the"
Senecan stage: translations of Seneca's tragedies had begun to appear in
"1559. _The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex_, or _Gorboduc_, as it was"
"originally and is now most commonly named, marks a new departure for"
English drama. To understand this we ought perhaps to say something
"about the essential features of a Greek tragedy (Seneca's own model),"
and make a note of any special Senecan additions. What strikes one most
in reading a play of Aeschylus is the prominence given to a composite
and almost colourless character known as the Chorus (for though it
"consists of a body of persons, it speaks, for the most part, as one),"
"the absence of any effective action from the stage, the limited number"
"of actors, and the tendency of any speaker to expand his remarks into a"
"set speech of considerable length. This tendency, especially noticeable"
"in the Chorus, whose speeches commonly take the form of chants,"
"encouraged the faculty of generalizing philosophically, so that one is"
constantly treated to general reflections expressive rather of broad
wisdom and piety than of feelings directly and dramatically aroused;
Some days after this a strange report was brought to the palace. By the
landing-place near the spot where the fire had been was a great
"fig-tree. It was so near to the landing-place, and was such a"
"magnificent tree, that travellers coming from the boats, or waiting for"
"a boat to arrive, would rest in numbers under its shade. But the report"
said that something had happened there. To travellers sleeping beneath
"the tree at night it was stated that two Nats had appeared, very large"
"and very beautiful, a man Nat and a woman Nat, and had frightened them"
"very much indeed. Noises were heard in the tree, voices and cries, and a"
"strange terror came upon those who approached it. Nay, it was even said"
"that men had been struck by unseen hands and severely hurt, and others,"
"it was said, had disappeared. Children who went to play under the tree"
"were never seen again: the Nats took them, and their parents sought for"
"them in vain. So the landing-place was deserted, and a petition was"
"brought to the king, and the king gave orders that the tree should be"
"hewn down. So the tree was cut down, and its trunk was thrown into the"
"river; it floated away out of sight, and nothing happened to the men"
"who cut the tree, though they were deadly afraid."
"The tree floated down for days, until at last it stranded near a"
"landing-place that led to a large town, where the governor of these"
parts lived; and at this landing-place the portents that had frightened
the people at the great city reappeared and terrified the travellers
"here too, and they petitioned the governor."
"The governor sought out a great monk, a very holy man learned in these"
"matters, and sent him to inquire, and the monk came down to the tree and"
"spoke. He said that if any Nats lived in the tree, they should speak to"
"him and tell him what they wanted. 'It is not fit,' he said, 'for great"
Nats to terrify the poor villagers at the landing-place. Let the Nats
speak and say what they require. All that they want shall be given.' And
the Nats spake and said that they wanted a place to live in where they
We know little of the early career of this remarkable buccaneer. He was
"loved by his crew, and had great influence over them. It is recorded that"
"one Sunday morning, finding some of his men gambling, he threw the dice"
"overboard, saying ""he would have no gambling aboard his ship."""
We know that on one occasion he was caught in his vessel by H.M.S.
"_Success_ and brought to Port Royal, Jamaica, and that on December 1st,"
"1679, he was in prison awaiting trial for piracy. Apparently he got off,"
for this brilliant young buccaneer is soon afterwards heard of as
"commanding a small vessel of sixteen tons, armed with but one gun and a"
"crew of thirty-five men. He was one of a party of 330 buccaneers who,"
"under the leadership of Coxon and Sharp, landed on the coast of Darien and"
marched through the jungle to attack and plunder the town of Santa Maria.
"The remainder of the journey across the isthmus was done in canoes, in"
which the pirates travelled down the Santa Maria River until they found
themselves in the Pacific. On this expedition each captain had his company
"and had his own colours, Sawkins's flag being a red one with yellow"
"stripes. Arrived at the sea, they captured two small Spanish vessels, and,"
"the rest of the company being in the canoes, they boldly sailed towards"
"Panama City. Meeting with the Spanish fleet of eight ships, the buccaneers"
"attacked it, and, after a most furious battle, came off victorious. This"
"was one of the most gallant episodes in the whole history of the ""brethren"
"of the coast,"" and was afterwards known as the Battle of Perico. Sawkins"
"fought in the most brave and desperate manner, and took a large share in"
"the successful enterprise. After this action some quarrelling took place,"
"which ended by Captain Coxon going off with some seventy men, to return"
across the isthmus on foot. The company that remained in the Pacific
"elected Sawkins to be their leader, as Captain Sharp, a much older man,"
was away in his ship.
"The buccaneers, ever since they defeated the Spanish fleet, had blockaded"
"the harbour, and a correspondence took place between the Governor of"
commons by various municipalities. Much of this land lies along the line
"of the railroad from Panama to David, and is of varying grades suitable"
"for grazing, forestry or agriculture. A fixed price of 50 cents per"
"hectare is charged, a hectare being practically 2¹⁄₂ acres. The"
government has gone quite efficiently into the task of disposing of
"these lands, and pamphlets explanatory of methods of securing titles,"
"terms, etc., can be obtained by addressing the Administrator-General at"
"Panama. The Pan-American Union, of Washington, D. C., has issued a"
pamphlet giving a summary in English of the Panamanian law bearing upon
the subject.
[Illustration: A NATIVE LIVING ROOM AND STAIRWAY
"By pulling up the bamboo ladder, or turning it, communication with the"
upper floor is closed]
"With the lack of labor, and the uncertainty of land titles, the final"
impediment to the general development of the interior of Panama is to be
found in the lack of roads. It is not that the roads are bad--that is
the case in many of our own commonwealths. But in a great part of Panama
"there are literally no roads at all. Trails, choked by the jungle and so"
"washed by the rains that they are merely lanes floored with boulders,"
are the rule. The heavy ox-cart is the only vehicle that will stand the
"going, and our light American farm wagons would be speedily racked to"
pieces. In the Canal Zone the Commission has built some of the best
"roads in the world, utilizing the labor of employees convicted of minor"
offenses. Stimulated by this example the Panama government has built one
excellent road from the chief city across the savannas to Old Panama and
thence onward into the interior. It is hoped that the spectacle of the
admirable roads in the Zone will encourage the authorities of the
Republic to go into road building on a large scale in their own country.
In no other way can its possibilities be realized. At present the rivers
publicity given to Indian affairs through the reports and hearings of a
"National Commission, would arouse the American people, and a brighter"
day for the Indian would certainly dawn.
"No matter what is said, the Commissioner must fight alone and"
single-handed with the members of Congress. His is a great
"responsibility. Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Valentine, in conversations with"
"me, have admitted that the chief difficulty in handling the Indian"
problem is found in the word “politics”. The Commissioner is dependent
on Congress for his appropriations. He may be sustained or opposed by
"members of Congress, and the public will remain in ignorance. He may not"
appeal save to the Secretary of the Interior. He must keep in mind the
wishes of his political party. He will not admit political pressure when
"in office, but after leaving the Service, he may tell his story of"
"trouble with politicians, as Mr. Leupp has in his book. Mr. Valentine"
"could enlighten us further on “The Indian Office in Politics”, did he"
care to speak. A paid National Commission would be dominated by _no_
political party. Ten years’ service would enable it to become entirely
"familiar with the needs of the Indians, whereas the average"
"Commissioner, serving less than three years, barely becomes acquainted"
with the problem when he is succeeded by a new appointee.
I recommend to the earnest consideration of the American people the
"Commission idea, as the only means of salvation of the American Indian."
It will be said by critics that many of the tribes are making
satisfactory progress and need no Commission; that the present
"organization of the Indian Office is sufficient. This is partly true,"
"but a study of the table of statistics, and reference to the testimony"
"submitted in this book, establishes the sad fact, that the majority of"
the Indians must lose unless we make a radical change in our policy. It
is useless to blind our eyes to hard facts; and these are that we
"develop a certain area after painstaking labor, and then through unwise"
"disturbed or destroyed, with the same result.]"

Destiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon
Buonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in
"Corsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the"
hard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It
"was a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the"
Mediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had
previously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.
Yet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was
"granted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the"
"coast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,"
"before the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French"
"commander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did"
Rousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against
this bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his
"compatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the"
"mountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and"
"clan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and"
"after the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking"
with him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With
"these irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but"
accepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French
sway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to
"Ajaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the"
"patriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, ""The Corsican people,"
"when exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced"
"Napoleon Buonaparte[5]."""
"Seeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,"
his sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He
certainly had not the grit of which heroes are made. His seems to have
"been an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as"
"of undue friendliness with Sir Jhon the Priest, but he dare not say so."
"Tyb guesses his doubts, and in her turn suspects that he is inclined to"
rebel. So she makes the yoke heavier. Johan Johan has to invite Sir Jhon
"to eat a most desirable pie with them; but throughout the meal, with"
jealousy at his heart and the still greater pangs of unsatisfied hunger
"a little lower, he is kept busy by his wife, trying to mend a leaky"
bucket with wax. Surely never did a scene contain more 'asides' than are
uttered and explained away by the crushed husband! Finally overtaxed
"endurance asserts itself, and wife and priest are driven out of doors;"
but the play closes with a very pronounced note of uncertainty from the
victor as to what new game the vanquished may shortly be at if he be not
there to see.
The all-important feature to be noticed in Heywood's work is that here
we have the drama escaping from its alliance with religion into the
"region of pure comedy. Here is no well planned moral, no sententious"
"mouthpiece of abstract excellence, no ruin of sinners and crowning of"
"saints. Here, too, is no Vice, no Devil, although they are the chief"
"media for comedy in other Interludes, nor is there any buffoonery; even"
"of its near cousins, scuffling and fighting, only one of the three plays"
"has more than a trace. Hence the earlier remark, that Heywood was before"
his time. It is not devils in bearskins and wooden-sworded vices that
create true comedy; they belong to the realm of farce. Yet they
"continued to flourish long after Heywood had set another example, and"
"with them the cuffing of ears and drunken gambolling which we may see,"
"in the works of other men, trying to rescue prosy scenes from dullness."
"In _Johan Johan_ is simple comedy, the comedy of laughter-raising"
"dialogue and 'asides'. We do not say it is perfect comedy, far from it;"
but it is comedy cleared of its former alloys. It is the comedy which
Shakespeare refined for his own use in _Twelfth Night_ and elsewhere.

One circumstance caused Boyd no little surprise and uneasiness--the
fact that no vigorous effort had been made to fix the blame for the
"striker's death on that riotous afternoon. Surely, he reasoned, Marsh's"
"detective must have witnessed the killing, and must recognize the ease"
with which the act could now be saddled upon him. If delay were their
"object, Emerson could not understand why they did not seek to have him"
arrested. The consequences might well be serious if Marsh's money were
"used; but, as the days slipped past and nothing occurred, he decided"
"that he had been overfearful on this score, or else that the manager of"
the Packers' Trust had limits beyond which he would not push his
persecution.
"A half-mile from Captain Peasley's ship, the rival Company tenders were"
"loading rapidly with union labor, and it seemed that in spite of Boyd's"
"plan to be first at Kalvik, Marsh's force would beat him to the ground"
unless greater efforts were made. When he communicated these fears to
"Big George, the fisherman suddenly became a slave-driver. He passed"
"among his men, cajoling, threatening, bribing, and they began to work"
"like demons, with the result that when the twentieth arrived he was"
able to announce to his partner that the work would be finished some
time during the following morning.
The next day Emerson and Clyde drove down to the dock with Cherry in a
"closed carriage, experiencing no annoyance beyond some jeers and"
insults as they passed through the picket line. Boyd had barely seen
"them comfortably established on board, when up the ship's gangway came"
"""Fingerless"" Fraser radiantly attired, three heavily laden hotel"
"porters groaning at his back, the customary thick-waisted cigar between"
The very question sobered him.
Suddenly it was as though he had left the din of the noisy thoroughfare
of life and had entered the majestic silence of a mighty cathedral;
"and from the great mysterious deeps a whisper came to his ears, each"
"syllable roundly phrased, clear, unhesitating, a chapter of this"
strange book of life that he had so lately read--the book that had
fired his blood and aroused his energy. The breath of these pages
"seemed to give him decision and free air, where before he had been"
"drifting aimlessly, going he knew not whither, caring not overmuch."
This book had braced him--it was a call to battle. He had had enough of
beds of roses and daffodils and idyllic trances. The phrasing of _The
Masterfolk_ came to him now:
“Nature has ordered that certain things shall be; and to him who
disobeys her ordering she is cruelly merciless. She has decreed that
"he shall be most dominant, shall breed the fittest race, shall know"
"the fullest life, shall achieve the highest destiny, who abides"
by the woman he loves. And him who is unclean she flings upon the
"dunghill--him and his seed for ever. Of the love of man for woman,"
Nature has spoken with no uncertain voice; and Nature’s judgment is
final. He that fears to love a woman sets himself against the supreme
law of life; he ends in unnatural vice; he is against the design of
life; celibacy Nature will none of--for celibacy stultifies life and
ends the race. Promiscuous love she condemns utterly and punishes
heavily with loathsome disease and with foul decay; the races of
"promiscuous love are become of the scum of the earth, and are dying"
"out. Against the love of many women also, once and for all, she"
has spoken. The peoples of many wives Nature is sweeping into the
waste corners of the world. Nature is her own jury--Nature alone her
own judge. She hath not said the Masterfolk cannot break from her
"also to undergo the ascendancy of her religion. As a matter of fact, her"
"fervent believers maintained her sanctuaries, despite the law, on the very"
"Capitol. Under Cæsar, Alexandrian astronomers had reformed the calendar of"
"the pontiffs, and Alexandrian priests soon marked the dates of Isis"
holidays upon it.
The decisive step was taken soon after the death of Tiberius. Caligula
erected the great temple of Isis Campensis on the Campus Martius probably
"in the year 38.[29] In order to spare the sacerdotal susceptibilities, he"
founded it outside of the sacred enclosure of the city of Servius. Later
Domitian made one of Rome's most splendid monuments of that temple. From
"that time Isis and Serapis enjoyed the favor of every imperial dynasty, the"
Flavians as well as the Antonines and the Severi. About the year 215
"Caracalla built an Isis temple, even more magnificent than that of"
"Domitian, on the Quirinal, in the heart of the city, and perhaps another"
"one on the Coelian. As the apologist Minucius Felix states, the Egyptian"
gods had become entirely Roman.[30]
The climax of their power seems to have been reached at the beginning of
the third century; later on the popular vogue and official support went to
"other divinities, like the Syrian Baals and the Persian {85} Mithras. The"
"progress of Christianity also deprived them of their power, which was,"
"however, still considerable until the end of the ancient world. The Isis"
processions that marched the streets of Rome were described by an eye
"witness as late as the year 394,[31] but in 391 the patriarch Theophilus"
"had consigned the Serapeum of Alexandria to the flames, having himself"
struck the first blow with an ax against the colossal statue of the god
that had so long been the object of a superstitious veneration. Thus the
"prelate destroyed the ""very head of idolatry,"" as Rufinus put it.[32]"
"As a matter of fact, idolatry received its death blow. The worship of the"
gods of the Ptolemies died out completely between the reigns of Theodosius
this extraordinary conflict Ralph is horribly belaboured by the
malicious Matthew under pretence of blows aimed at Dame Custance. Act
"V, however, brings Goodluck himself and explanations. That worthy man"
"finds his lady true, friendship is established all round, and Ralph and"
Merrygreek join the happy couple in a closing feast.
This bald outline perhaps makes sufficiently clear the great advance in
"plot structure. Within the play, however, are many other good things."
"The character of Ralph Roister Doister, 'a vain-glorious, cowardly"
"blockhead', as the list of dramatis personae has it, is thoroughly well"
"done: his heavy love-sighs, his confident elation, his distrust, his"
"gullibility, his ups and downs and contradictions, are all in the best"
"comic vein. Only second in fullness of portraiture, and truer to Nature,"
"is Dame Custance, who--if we exclude Melibaea as not native to English"
shores--may be said to bring into English secular drama honourable
"womanhood. Her amused indifference at first, her sharp reproof of her"
"maids who have allowed themselves to act as Ralph's messengers, her"
"gathering vexation at Ralph's tiresome wooing, her genuine alarm when"
she sees that his boastful words are accepted by the sea-captain as
truth--these are sentiments and emotions copied from a healthy and
"worthy model. Matthew Merrygreek, an unmistakable 'Vice' ever at Ralph's"
"elbow, is of all Vices the shrewdest striker of laughter out of a block"
of stupidity: it is from his ingenious brain that almost every absurd
"scene is evolved for the ridiculing of Ralph. Thoroughly human, and"
"quite assertive, are the lower characters, the maid-servants and"
"men-servants, Madge Mumblecrust, Tibet Talkapace, Truepenny, Dobinet"
Doughty and the rest. Need it be added that the battle in Act IV is pure
fooling? or that jolly songs enliven the scenes with their rousing
choruses (e.g. 'I mun be married a Sunday')? _Ralph Roister Doister_ is
an English comedy with English notions of the best way of amusing
English folk of the sixteenth century. With all its improvements it has
"no suggestion of the alien about it, as has the classically-flavoured"
"Occasionally, their dancing is really remarkably interesting, when a"
large amount of pantomime enters into it and they develop the story of
"some primitive action, as, for instance, the drawing of the water,"
"cutting the wood, making the fire, cooking the food, etc., ending in a"
burst of song symbolizing the joys of the new prepared feast. In an
extremely crude form it reminds one of the old opera ballets and seems
"to be a composite of the original African and the ancient Spanish, which"
is very probably the case.

"neighbors. Many cultivate fields of cane or rice as well, and amidst the"
"silvery greens, stretching for some distance, the quaint blue figures of"
the workmen in their huge hats make a charming picture. Through the
rubber sections Chinese ‘middlemen’ are of late frequently found buying
"that valuable commodity for their fellow countrymen in Panama City, who"
are now doing quite a large business in rubber. These people live much
"as in their native land, seldom learning more than a few words of"
"Spanish (except those living in the towns), and they form a very"
substantial and good element of the population”.

To enumerate even by names the aboriginal tribes would be tedious and
"unavailing. Among the more notable are the Doracho-Changuina, of"
"My arrival was a very untoward event to the natives, and complicated"
"matters, causing great annoyance to Tovasana, the main headman. I had"
"landed in his own little village, Nu'agasi, on the island of Gumasila,"
"for it was impossible to anchor near the big village, nor would there"
"have been room for pitching a tent. Now, in the Amphletts, a white"
"man is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and to my knowledge, only once"
"before, a white trader remained there for a few weeks. To leave me"
"alone with the women and one or two old men was impossible, according"
"to their ideas and fears, and none of the younger men wanted to forgo"
"the privilege and pleasure of taking part in the expedition. At last,"
"I promised them to move to the neighbouring island of Nabwageta,"
"as soon as the men were gone, and with this they were satisfied."
"As the date fixed for the arrival of the Dobuans approached, the"
"excitement grew. Little by little the news arrived, and was eagerly"
"received and conveyed to me: ""Some sixty canoes of the Dobuans are"
"coming,"" ""the fleet is anchored off Tewara,"" ""each canoe is heavily"
"laden with food and gifts,"" ""Kauyaporu sails in his canoe, he is"
"toli'uvalaku, and has a big pandanus streamer attached to the prow."" A"
"string of other names followed which had very little meaning for me,"
since I was not acquainted with the Dobuan natives. From another part
"of the world, from the Trobriands, the goal of the whole expedition,"
"news reached us again: ""To'uluwa, the chief of Kiriwina has gone"
"to Kitava--he will soon come back, bringing plenty of mwali."" ""The"
"Sinaketans are going there to fetch some of the mwali."" ""The Vakutans"
"have been in Kitava and brought back great numbers of mwali."" It"
"was astonishing to hear all this news, arriving at a small island,"
"apparently completely isolated with its tiny population, within"
"these savage and little navigated seas; news only a few days old,"
yet reporting events which had occurred at a travelling distance of
some hundred miles.
"The procession of drunkards on Palm Sunday, the saving of the"
"shipwrecked crew, the old men waiting for the travelling cart while the"
"drivers are still drinking, all these are Dutch genre pieces of the best"
sort.
We like to speak of the realism of the Renaissance. Erasmus is certainly
a realist in the sense of having an insatiable hunger for knowledge of
the tangible world. He wants to know things and their names: the
"particulars of each thing, be it never so remote, such as those terms of"
games and rules of games of the Romans. Read carefully the description
of the decorative painting on the garden-house of the _Convivium
"religiosum_: it is nothing but an object lesson, a graphic"
representation of the forms of reality.
"In its joy over the material universe and the supple, pliant word, the"
Renaissance revels in a profusion of imagery and expressions. The
"resounding enumerations of names and things, which Rabelais always"
"gives, are not unknown to Erasmus, but he uses them for intellectual and"
useful purposes. In _De copia verborum ac rerum_ one feat of varied
power of expression succeeds another--he gives fifty ways of saying:
"'Your letter has given me much pleasure,' or, 'I think that it is going"
to rain'. The aesthetic impulse is here that of a theme and variations:
to display all the wealth and mutations of the logic of language.
"Elsewhere, too, Erasmus indulges this proclivity for accumulating the"
treasures of his genius; he and his contemporaries can never restrain
themselves from giving all the instances instead of one: in _Ratio verae
"theologiae_, in _De pronuntiatione_, in _Lingua_, in _Ecclesiastes_. The"
"collections of _Adagia_, _Parabolae_, and _Apophthegmata_ are altogether"
"based on this eagerness of the Renaissance (which, by the way, was an"
inheritance of the Middle Ages themselves) to luxuriate in the wealth of
"the tangible world, to revel in words and things."
"the rapid diminution in the supply of real ivory, should be a growing"
one.
"Indeed, the more one studies Panama and its resources the more one is"
convinced that all that is necessary to make the country a rich and
"prosperous one, or at any rate to cause it to create riches and"
"prosperity for investors, is the application of capital, labor and"
systematic management to the resources it already possesses. In its 400
years of Spanish and mestizo control these three factors have been
"continuously lacking. There are men in Panama, of native birth and of"
"Spanish origin, who have undertaken to develop certain of the land’s"
resources and have moderately enriched themselves. But the most striking
evidence of the success to be obtained from attacking the industrial
problem in Panama systematically and in a big way is that furnished by
"the operations of the United Fruit Company, the biggest business fact in"
the tropics.
"Panama is, of course, only one link in the colossal chain of the"
operations of this company in the tropics. The rapidly increasing
prosperity of many of the Central Republics is due largely to the
"sweeping scope of the United Fruit Company, and its impress is in"
evidence all along the north coast of South America and throughout the
West Indies. Its interests in Jamaica are enormous. Cuba put Jamaica off
"the sugar map, but the United Fruit Company came to her rescue with an"
"offer to purchase all the bananas her planters could furnish, and"
"Jamaica now leads the American tropics with 17,000,000 bunches annually,"
"of which the United Fruit Company obtains nearly half, the balance being"
handled by its competitors. The company also owns the famous Titchfield
"Hotel of Port Antonio, and operates the Myrtle Bank Hotel of Kingston."
"In Cuba the company owns 60,000 acres of sugar plantations and its two"
great sugar mills will this year add to the world’s product an amount
"with a market value in excess of $10,000,000. Its scores of white"
faith. It was a world that had never existed as such. For with the
historical reality which the times of Constantine and the great fathers
of the Church had manifested--that of declining Latinity and
"deteriorating Hellenism, the oncoming barbarism and the oncoming"
Byzantinism--it had nothing in common. Erasmus's imagined world was an
"amalgamation of pure classicism (this meant for him, Cicero, Horace,"
Plutarch; for to the flourishing period of the Greek mind he remained
"after all a stranger) and pure, biblical Christianity. Could it be a"
"union? Not really. In Erasmus's mind the light falls, just as we saw in"
"the history of his career, alternately on the pagan antique and on the"
Christian. But the warp of his mind is Christian; his classicism only
"serves him as a form, and from Antiquity he only chooses those elements"
which in ethical tendency are in conformity with his Christian ideal.
[Illustration: XVI. ERASMUS AT THE AGE OF 57]
"And because of this, Erasmus, although he appeared after a century of"
"earlier Humanism, is yet new to his time. The union of Antiquity and the"
"Christian spirit which had haunted the mind of Petrarch, the father of"
"Humanism, which was lost sight of by his disciples, enchanted as they"
"were by the irresistible brilliance of the antique beauty of form, this"
union was brought about by Erasmus.
What pure Latinity and the classic spirit meant to Erasmus we cannot
"feel as he did because its realization does not mean to us, as to him, a"
difficult conquest and a glorious triumph. To feel it thus one must have
"acquired, in a hard school, the hatred of barbarism, which already"
during his first years of authorship had suggested the composition of
the _Antibarbari_. The abusive term for all that is old and rude is
"already Gothic, Goths. The term barbarism as used by Erasmus comprised"
much of what we value most in the medieval spirit. Erasmus's conception
of the great intellectual crisis of his day was distinctly dualistic. He
results attending them. Wounds were met with in every part of the small
gut; but I saw no case in which an injury to the duodenum could be
specially diagnosed.
"As to the symptoms which attended these injuries, it is somewhat"
"difficult to speak with precision, and it must be left to my readers to"
form an opinion as to how many of the cases recounted below were really
instances of perforating wounds. My own view is that in the majority of
"the cases that got well spontaneously, the injury was not of a"
"perforating nature, and that for reasons which have been already set"
"forth. It will, however, be at once noted that in all the five cases in"
which the injury was certainly diagnosed in hospital death occurred.
The cases of injury to the small intestine are perhaps best arranged in
three classes.
"1. Those who died upon the field, or shortly after removal from it. In"
"these the external wounds were often large, the omentum was not rarely"
"prolapsed, and escape of fæces sometimes occurred early. Shock from the"
"severity of the lesion, and hæmorrhage, were no doubt important factors"
in the early lethal issue in this class. Many of the injuries were no
"doubt produced by bullets striking irregularly, by ricochets, by bullets"
"of the expanding forms, or by bullets of large calibre. As being beyond"
"the bounds of surgical aid, this class possessed the least interest."
"2. Cases brought into the Field, or even the Stationary hospitals, with"
"symptoms of moderate severity, or even of an insignificant character,"
in which evidence of septic peritonitis suddenly developed and death
ensued.
3. Cases in which the position of the wounds raised the possibility of
"injury to the intestine, but in which the symptoms were slight or of"
"though it contained a definitely evolved plot, sent barely a ripple over"
the surface of succeeding authorship. It represents the steadfastness of
the maiden Melibaea against the entreaties of her lover Calisto and the
"much more crafty, indeed almost successful, wiles of the procuress,"
"Celestine. True, the play is dull enough. But if dramatists had been"
"awake to their defects, the value of the new importation from a foreign"
"literature would have been noticed. The years passed, however, without"
"producing imitators, until some time in the years between 1544 and 1551"
"a Latin scholar, reading the plays of Plautus, decided to write a comedy"
"like them. Latin Comedies, both in the original tongue and in"
"translation, had appeared in England in previous years, but only as"
"strayed foreigners. Nicholas Udall, the head master of Eton School,"
"proposed a very different thing, namely, an English comedy which should"
rival in technique the comedies of the Latins. The result was _Ralph
Roister Doister_. He called it an Interlude. Posterity has given it the
title of 'the first regular English comedy'.
"Divided into five acts, with subordinate scenes, this play develops its"
story with deliberate calculated steps. Acts I and II are occupied by
Ralph's vain attempts to soften the heart of Dame Christian Custance by
"gifts and messages. In Act III come complications, double-dealings."
"Matthew Merrygreek plays Ralph false, tortures his love, misreads--by"
"the simple trick of mispunctuation--his letter to the Dame, and thus,"
"under a mask of friendship, sets him further than ever from success."
"Still deeper complexities appear with Act IV, for now arrives, with"
"greetings from Gawin Goodluck, long betrothed to Dame Custance, a"
"certain sea-captain, who, misled by Ralph's confident assurance,"
"misunderstands the relations between the Dame and him, suspects"
"disloyalty, and changes from friendliness to cold aloofness. This, by"
"vexing the lady, brings disaster upon Ralph, whose bold attempt, on the"
"suggestion of Merrygreek, to carry his love off by force is repulsed by"
that Dame's Amazonian band of maid-servants with scuttles and brooms. In
had continuous performances; there was Grand Opera; there were
"exhibitions of toys, or pictures, and charitable bazaars. Ten days"
after the fall of Antwerp _char-à-bancs_ packed with Belgians drove
out of Brussels to visit the scenes of the battles and those
"shattered forts, so fatuously deemed impregnable, so feeble in their"
resistance to German artillery.
"Vivie, even had she wished to do so, could not have joined the"
sight-seers. As the subjects of an enemy power she and her mother
had had early in January to register themselves at the Kommandantur
and were there warned that without a special passport they might not
pass beyond the limits of Brussels and its suburbs. Except in the
"matter of the farewell visit to the farm at Tervueren, Vivie was"
"reluctant to ask for any such favour from von Giesselin, though she"
was curious to see the condition of Louvain and to ascertain whether
her father still inhabited the monastic house of his order--she had
an idea that he was away in Germany in connection with his schemes
for raising the Irish against the British Government. Von Giesselin
however was becoming sentimentally inclined towards her and she saw
no more of him than was necessary to maintain polite relations. Frau
"von Giesselin, for various reasons of health or children, could not"
join him at Brussels as so many German wives had done with other of
the high functionaries (to the great embitterment of Brussels
society); and there were times when von Giesselin's protestations of
his loneliness alarmed her.
The King of Saxony had paid a visit to Brussels in the late autumn
of 1914 and had invited this Colonel of his Army to a fastuous
banquet given at the Palace Hotel. The King--whom the still defiant
"Brussels Press, especially that unkillable _La Libre Belgique_,"
"reminded ironically of his domestic infelicity, by enquiring"
whether he had brought Signor Toselli to conduct his orchestra--was
"most part submissive; and _if they were not_, the arm of the Church was"
very long and her grasp mortal.... They [the thinkers] could have taught
"Europe _earlier than the Church allowed it to learn_, that the sun does"
"not go round the earth, and that it is the earth which goes round the"
sun.... After the middle of the last century the insurrection against
the pretensions of the Church and against the doctrines of Christianity
"was marked in one of its most important phases by a new, and most"
"significant, feature.... It was an advance both in knowledge and"
in moral motive.... The philosophical movement was represented by
"""Diderot"" [leading the Encyclopaedist circle.]... Broadly stated the"
"great central moral of it was this: that human nature is good, that the"
"world is capable of being made a desirable abiding-place, and that the"
evil of the world _is the fruit of bad education and bad institutions_.
This cheerful doctrine now strikes on the ear as a commonplace and a
"truism. A hundred years ago in France it was a wonderful gospel, _and"
the beginning of a new dispensation.... Into what fresh and unwelcome
sunlight it brought the articles of the old theology... Every social
improvement since has been the outcome of that new doctrine in one form
or another_.... The teaching of the Church paints men as fallen and
depraved. The deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the new fabric
rising was very natural.... The new secular knowledge clashed at
"a thousand points, alike in letter and spirit, with the old sacred"
"lore.... A hundred years ago this perception was vague and indefinite,"
but there was an unmistakable apprehension that _the Catholic ideal
"of womanhood_ was no more adequate to the facts of life, than Catholic"
"views about science, or popery, or labor, or political order and"
"authority.""--Morley."
"And it took the rising infidels to discover the fact. See Morley,"
"""Diderot,"" p. 76."
"""The greatest fact in the intellectual history of the eighteenth century"
fountains. In the church which has been built over them we were shown
"the pillar to which he was bound, and the block of marble upon which"
"he was decapitated, and, in the vault of another church hard by, the"
prison in which he was placed just before his execution.
We could not help asking the priest who was our escort whether this
"extraordinary story was still believed. His answer was: ""Certainly!"
There is no reason whatever to doubt it. The facts have been handed
"down in an unbroken succession from eye-witnesses,"" a position which"
he proceeded to defend at length and with great warmth when one of our
party in particular manifested much slowness to believe.
[Sidenote: St. Paul's Use of Plautilla's Veil.]
"Furthermore, the opening of these three fountains was not the only"
miracle wrought by the apostle after his death. Mrs. Jameson says:
"""The legend of his death relates that a certain Roman matron named"
"Plautilla, one of the converts of S. Peter, placed herself on the road"
"by which S. Paul passed to his martyrdom, to behold him for the last"
time; and when she saw him she wept greatly and besought his blessing.
"The apostle then, seeing her faith, turned to her, and begged that she"
"would give him her veil to blind his eyes when he should be beheaded,"
promising to return it to her after his death. The attendants mocked
"at such a promise; but Plautilla, with a woman's faith and charity,"
"taking off her veil, presented it to him. After his martyrdom, S. Paul"
"appeared to her and restored the veil, stained with his blood. In the"
"ancient representations of the martyrdom of S. Paul, the legend of"
Plautilla is seldom omitted. In the picture by Giotto in the Sacristy
"of S. Peter's, Plautilla is seen on an eminence in the background,"
"receiving the veil from the hands of S. Paul, who appears in the"
"clouds above; the same representation, but little varied, is executed"
"in bas-relief on the bronze doors of St. Peter's."""
"fashionable world was well aware, because the young duchess is a great"
"lady in London as well as elsewhere, and all her doings are chronicled"
in advance. The fashionable world had promptly decided to dine there
"too, and telephoned in breathless haste for tables. It filled the"
"restaurant at an unusually early hour, and a disappointed overflow"
displayed itself in the _foyer_.
The Duchess of Dawn is one of the most beautiful women in England. The
"eyes of the fashionable world were focussed on her and her guests, among"
whom were a minor European prince and a famous field-marshal who had not
"been on show in London for long, until there appeared from the crowded"
"_foyer_, upon the arm of an old-young man of distinguished appearance"
"and faultless _tenue_, a tall, slender girl, at whom, as she passed,"
"every one turned to gaze, with undisguised admiration or envy, according"
to sex and temperament.
"She was gowned to distraction, and by an artist in women's wear. Her"
beautiful bare arms and shoulders and bosom were free of superfluous
"ornament. Her pure, proud, sensitive features were faintly flushed,--as"
"though, if that were conceivable, she was wearing evening dress for the"
"first time, and found it trying,--but her curved crimson lips were"
"slightly parted in a most bewitching smile, and, from under their"
"drooping lashes, her radiant eyes looked a demure, amused, impersonal"
defiance at the frankly curious faces upturned toward her. The shaded
"lights made most enchanting lights and shadows among her hair, red-gold"
"and heaped about her head in heavy coils, as she moved modestly through"
"the thronged room toward a corner where, about a beautifully decorated"
"table, four motionless waiters were standing guard over four empty"
chairs.
"She sat down there, her back to the bulk of the company, and her escort"
"took the seat opposite. A portly, prosperous-looking, elderly man, with"
THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
At the invitation of the President and the committee of the Faridpore
"Industrial Exhibition, Dr. J. C. Bose gave a lecture on the life of his"
"father, the late Babu Bhugwan Chunder Bose, who founded the Exhibition"
"at Faridpore, where he was the sub-divisional officer, 50 years ago. It"
"was published in the Modern Review for February 1917--volume xxi, p."
"221. In course of his address, said Dr. Bose:--"
"It is the obvious, the insistent, the blatant that often blinds us to"
"the essential. And in solving the mystery that underlies life, the"
"enlightenment will come not by the study of the complex man, but through"
"the simpler plant. It is the unsuspected forces, hidden to the eyes of"
"men,--the forces imprisoned in the soil and the stimuli of alternating"
flash of light and the gloomings of darkness these and many others will
be found to maintain the ceaseless activity which we know as the fulness
of throbbing life.
This is likewise true of the congeries of life which we call a society
or a nation. The energy which moves this great mass in ceaseless effort
"to realise some common aspiration, often has its origin in the unknown"
"solitudes of a village life. And thus the history of some efforts, not"
"forgotten, which emanated from Faridpore, may be found not unconnected"
with which India is now meeting her problems to-day. How did these
problems first dawn in the minds of some men who forecast themselves by
"half a century? How fared their hopes, how did their dreams become"
buried in oblivion? Where lies the secret of that potency which makes
"certain efforts apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath"
"the smouldering ashes? Are these dead failures, so utterly unrelated to"
some great success that we may acclaim to day? When we look deeper we
"shall find that this is not so, that as inevitable as in the sequence of"
"bloodiest persecution against the priests of Isis that they ever suffered,"
"in consequence of a scandalous affair in which a matron, a noble and some"
priests of Isis were implicated.
"All these police measures, however, were strangely ineffectual. The"
Egyptian worship was excluded from Rome and her immediate neighborhood in
"theory if not in fact, but the rest of the world remained open to its"
propaganda.[27]
With the beginning of the empire it slowly invaded the center and the north
"of Italy and spread into the provinces. Merchants, sailors, slaves,"
"artisans, Egyptian men of letters, even the discharged soldiers of the"
three legions cantoned in the valley of the Nile contributed to its
"diffusion. It entered Africa by way of Carthage, and the Danubian countries"
through the great emporium of Aquileia. The new province of Gaul was
invaded through the valley of the Rhone. At that period many Oriental
emigrants went to seek their fortunes in these new countries. Intimate
"relations existed between the cities of Arles and Alexandria, and we know"
"that a colony of Egyptian Greeks, established at Nimes by Augustus, took"
the gods of their native country thither.[28] At the beginning of our era
there set in that great movement of conversion that soon established the
worship of Isis and Serapis from the outskirts of the Sahara to the vallum
"of Britain, and from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Danube."
The resistance still offered by the central power could not last much
longer. It was impossible to dam in this overflowing stream whose
thundering waves struck the {84} shaking walls of the _pomerium_ from every
side. The prestige of Alexandria seemed invincible. At that period the city
"was more beautiful, more learned, and better policed than Rome. She was the"
"model capital, a standard to which the Latins strove to rise. They"
"translated the works of the scholars of Alexandria, imitated her authors,"
invited her artists and copied her institutions. It is plain that they had
"""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one"
quartermaster.
"""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though"
"some one were smoking in the forward cabin."""
"""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the"
"fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the"
"quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must"
"be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first"
"cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,"
"and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,"
"and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,"
"then it is all up with us!"""
"""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up"
"with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who"
"knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out"
"of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything"
"in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were"
"useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether"
"he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide"
"behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,"
"he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him"
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
"prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made"
"it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full"
"measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as"
"upon some great man, an attack against the Tories, the Whigs, the"
"Dissenters?  If so, they would read it; for there was great eagerness"
"amongst the people to read such things, and no matter what side was"
"attacked, there were hundreds eager to buy and to read.  But a"
romance—no; that was a mistake altogether.  A writer of successful
"pamphlets might perhaps find readers for a merry tale, or even a"
"romance; but for an unknown aspirant to fame—no, that was another"
matter.  No one would buy it; no one would even read it; though there
"were one or two who took it and glanced through some pages, praised the"
"style and the easy flow of words, and advised me to take to"
"pamphleteering, promising that they would read anything like that."""
"""That is it, that is it!"" cried the Old Lion, rising and pacing up and"
"down the room with his halting stride.  ""Write a filthy lampoon, a"
"scurrilous libel, a fiery diatribe against any great or notable man, and"
all the world will read and set themselves agog to know the writer.
"Look at Swift, with his ’Tale of a Tub;’ look at De Foe, with his crowd"
"of pamphlets—men of talent, I do not doubt or deny, but full of gall and"
"bitterness.  Yet they are read by all the world.  Fame, if not fortune,"
"has come to them, and fortune will doubtless follow.  The late King,"
"they say, would have made Swift a bishop.  The Queen will not: his"
ribald wit disgusts her; but he has admirers and patrons everywhere.  It
is the bold and unscrupulous who flourish like the grass of the field.
"True poetry and literary beauty are not asked, or even desired.  A pen"
dipped in gall is a pen dipped in gold in these days of party strife.
"And the genius that wields not this bitter pen sits in dust and ashes,"
"asking bread, and that well-nigh in vain."""
"""How should I write these party diatribes—I who know little of their"
"cries?  Whig or Tory, Tory or Whig—what care I?  The Tory of one"
Parliament is the Whig of the next.  Have not Lords Marlborough and
"Godolphin gone over to the Whigs? The Queen herself, they say, is"
with other nations with whom they want to live in peace. And they
realise any predominant interest of a foreign country in their trade or
manufacture is sure to lead to misunderstanding and friction. Actuated
by this idea they have practically excluded all foreign manufactured
articles by prohibitive tariffs.
REVIVAL OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES
Is our country slow to realise the danger that threatens her by the
capture of her market and the total destruction of her industries? Does
she not realise that it is helpless passivity that directly provokes
aggression? Has not the recent happenings in China served as an object
"lesson? There is, therefore, no time to be lost and the utmost effort is"
demanded of the Government and the people for the revival of our own
industries. The various attempts that have hitherto been made have not
been as successful as the necessity of the case demands. The efforts of
the Government and of the people have hitherto been spasmodic and often
worked at cross purposes. The Government should have an advisory body
of Indian members. There should be some modification of rules as regards
selection of Industrial scholars. Before being sent out to foreign
countries they should be made to study the conditions of manufacture in
this country and its difficulties. For a particular industry there
"should be a co-ordinated group of three scholars, two for the industrial"
and one for the commercial side. Difficulties would arise in adapting
foreign knowledge to Indian conditions. This can only be overcome by the
"devoted labour of men of originality, who have been trained in our"
future Research Laboratory. The Government could also materially help
(i) by offering facilities for the supply of raw materials (ii) by
offering expert advice (iii) by starting experimental industries. He had
reason to think that the Government is full alive to the crucial
importance of the subject and is determined to take every step
"I have not, indeed, always attempted to reach the explanation of things"
I have seen. When I have satisfied myself that a belief is really held
"by the people, that I am not the subject of conscious deception, either"
"by myself or others, I have conceived that my work was ended."
"There are those who, in investigating any foreign customs and strange"
"beliefs, can put their finger here and say, 'This is where they are"
"right'; and there and say, 'This belief is foolishly wrong and idiotic.'"
"I am not, unfortunately, one of these writers. I have no such confident"
belief in my own infallibility of judgment as to be able to sit on high
"and say, 'Here is truth, and here is error.'"
"I will leave my readers to make their own judgment, if they desire to do"
so; only asking them (as they would not like their own beliefs to be
scoffed and sneered at) that they will treat with respect the sincere
"beliefs of others, even if they cannot accept them. It is only in this"
way that we can come to understand a people and to sympathize with them.
It is hardly necessary to emphasize the enormous effect that a belief in
transmigration such as this has upon the life and intercourse of the
"people. Of their kindness to animals I have spoken elsewhere, and it is"
"possible this belief in transmigration has something to do with it, but"
"not, I think, much. For if you wished to illtreat an animal, it would be"
"quite easy, even more easy, to suppose that an enemy or a murderer"
"inhabited the body of the animal, and that you were but carrying out the"
"decrees of fate by ill-using it. But when you love an animal, it may"
"increase that love and make it reasonable, and not a thing to be ashamed"
"of; and it brings the animal world nearer to you in general, it bridges"
over the enormous void between man and beast that other religions have
made. Nothing humanizes a man more than love of animals.
"substantially borne out by Grattan, _Netherlands_, pp. 18, 34;"
"Blok, _Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Volk_, i, 159, 160,"
"305-11, Eng. tr. i, 203-8; Wauters, _Les libertés communales_,"
"1878, pp. 222-30. As is noted by Blok, the status of the peasantry"
"fluctuated, the thirteenth century being one of partial"
"retrogression. Cp. pp. 318, 319, as to the general depression of"
"the peasant class. The great impulse to slavery, as above noted,"
seems to have been given by the Norse pirates in general and the
"later Norman invaders, who, under Godfrey, forced every ""free"""
Frisian to wear a halter. The comparative protection accruing to
slaves of the Church was embraced by multitudes. In the time of the
"Crusades, again, many serfs were sold or mortgaged to the Church by"
the nobles in order to obtain funds for their expedition.
The cities were thus the liberating and civilising forces;[739] and the
application of townsmen's capital to the land was an early influence in
improving rural conditions.[740] But there was no escape from the
fatality of strife in the Teutonic any more than in the ancient Greek or
"in the contemporary Italian world. Flanders, having the large markets of"
"France at hand, developed its clothmaking and other industries more"
"rapidly than the Frisian districts, where weaving was probably earlier"
"carried on;[741] and here serfdom disappeared comparatively early,[742]"
the nobility dwindling through their wars; but the new industrial
"strifes of classes, which grew up everywhere in the familiar fashion,"
naturally matured the sooner in the more advanced civilisation; and
already at the beginning of the fourteenth century we find a resulting
disintegration. The monopoly methods of the trade gilds drove much of
"the weaving industry into the villages; then the Franco-Flemish wars,"
"wherein the townspeople, by expelling the French in despite of the"
"nobility, greatly strengthened their position,[743] nevertheless tended,"
"as did the subsequent civil wars, to drive trade into South Brabant."
"metamorphic rocks, is composed of mica and quartz in alternating"
"wavy folia. All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced,"
and in many cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of
slates and shales. It is widespread in New England and along the
eastern side of the Appalachians. TALC SCHIST consists of quartz
"and TALC, a light-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel, and so"
soft that it can be scratched with the thumb nail.
"HORNBLENDE SCHIST, resulting in many cases from the foliation of"
"basic igneous rocks, is made of folia of hornblende alternating"
with bands of quartz and feldspar. Hornblende schist is common
over large areas in the Lake Superior region.
QUARTZ SCHIST is produced from quartzite by the development of
fine folia of mica along planes of shear. All gradations may be
found between it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica
schist on the other.
Under the resistless pressure of crustal movements almost any
"rocks, sandstones, shales, lavas of all kinds, granites, diorites,"
and gabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and
"shearing. Limestones, however, are metamorphosed by pressure into"
"marble, the grains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to"
interlocking crystals of calcite.
These few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic
"rocks. As we have seen, they owe their origin to the alteration of"
both of the other classes of rocks--the sedimentary and the
"igneous--by heat and pressure, assisted usually by the presence of"
water. The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid
"cementation, their more or less complete recrystallization, and"
their foliation; but the change is often so complete that no trace
for him to sleep in. But the curious thing was that the monk seemed to
"know it all. He knew the monastery and the path to it, and the ways"
"about the village, and the names of the hills and the streams. It"
"seemed, indeed, as if he must once have lived there in the village, and"
"yet no one knew him or recognised his face, though he was but a young"
"man still, and there were villagers who had lived there for seventy"
"years. Next morning, instead of going on his way, the monk came into the"
"village with his begging-bowl, as monks do, and went round and collected"
"his food for the day; and in the evening, when the villagers went to see"
"him at the monastery, he told them he was going to stay. He recalled to"
"them the monk who had planted the teak-trees, and how he had said that"
"when the trees were grown he would return. 'I,' said the young monk, 'am"
"he that planted these trees. Lo, they are grown up, and I am returned,"
and now we will build a monastery as I said.'
"When the villagers, doubting, questioned him, and old men came and"
"talked to him of traditions of long-past days, he answered as one who"
knew all. He told them he had been born and educated far away in the
"South, and had grown up not knowing who he had been; and that he had"
"entered a monastery, and in time became a Pongyi. The remembrance came"
"to him, he went on, in a dream of how he had planted the trees and had"
promised to return to that village far away in the forest.
"The very next day he had started, and travelled day after day and week"
"upon week, till at length he had arrived, as they saw. So the villagers"
"were convinced, and they set to work and cut down the great boles, and"
built the monastery such as my friend saw. And the monk lived there all
"his life, and taught the children, and preached the marvellous teaching"
"of the great Buddha, till at length his time came again and he returned;"
"for of monks it is not said that they die, but that they return."
This is the common belief of the people. Into this has the mystery of
is again one of the unsolved contradictions of his being. He _is_
precipitate and careless; he _wants_ to be careful and cautious; his
"mind drives him to be the first, his nature restrains him, but usually"
only after the word has been written and published. The result is a
continual intermingling of explosion and reserve.
The way in which Erasmus always tries to shirk definite statements
irritates us. How carefully he always tries to represent the
"_Colloquies_, in which he had spontaneously revealed so much of his"
"inner convictions, as mere trifling committed to paper to please his"
friends. They are only meant to teach correct Latin! And if anything is
"said in them touching matters of faith, it is not I who say it, is it?"
"As often as he censures classes or offices in the _Adagia_, princes"
"above all, he warns the readers not to regard his words as aimed at"
particular persons.
"Erasmus was a master of reserve. He knew, even when he held definite"
"views, how to avoid direct decisions, not only from caution, but also"
because he saw the eternal ambiguity of human issues.
"Erasmus ascribes to himself an unusual horror of lies. On seeing a liar,"
"he says, he was corporeally affected. As a boy he already violently"
"disliked mendacious boys, such as the little braggart of whom he tells"
in the _Colloquies_. That this reaction of aversion is genuine is not
contradicted by the fact that we catch Erasmus himself in untruths.
"Inconsistencies, flattery, pieces of cunning, white lies, serious"
"suppression of facts, simulated sentiments of respect or sorrow--they"
may all be pointed out in his letters. He once disavowed his deepest
conviction for a gratuity from Anne of Borselen by flattering her
bigotry. He requested his best friend Batt to tell lies in his behalf.
"He most sedulously denied his authorship of the Julius dialogue, for"
"fear of the consequences, even to More, and always in such a way as to"
"outside, where an elaborate etiquette had made the rules even for the"
trees to grow in seemliness with a most gentlemanly existence. For him
were no disturbing peerings into human destiny--he raised no rough
"alarms by strenuous aims and vigorous thinking. Pretty, dandified,"
"he--always. Sinning easily enough, but always like a gentleman. Never"
"a crudity. As a perfumed fan fluttered by jewelled slender fingers,"
blowing cool fragrant airs that kiss the painted cheek of some
"frail beauty, he uttered his lines--obscene often, but by the most"
gentlemanly of innuendoes. The unmannerly thing was the only sin. The
display of a profound emotion was the depth of ill-breeding. So sang
"he, tunefully always, guiltless of all rough accent of originality;"
"sang of peacocks and green carnations and blue roses, of butterflies"
"and pools and dragonflies and souls, of ivory and silver, and of"
"dawn and dusk and dew, and white shoulders sweet, beauties who moved"
languidly with rustle of silk--so wafted he to you nothing more vibrant
than whisper of women and scent of perfumed chambers and flowers and
"bowers and rose and amarynth and asphodel and daffodil, of moonlight"
and music and kiss and gavotte and little tiny things--and always in
the most gentlemanly manner. He milked the unicorn. Always a would-be
"suggestion of mysterious deep-hid symbolism that ended where it began,"
and at most only the dark hint of well-bred tragedy.
"He moved impatiently now, as impatiently as he might, complaining that"
the shop-window into which he deigned to cast his reflection was tinted
with amethyst.
"“Come, Greppel,” said he--“let us gaze at ourselves in another"
window--this is an ageing colour.”
Then came the terrible tragedy of a fire at a charity bazaar; a most
patrician function with much upper clergy in it was smitten with sudden
"western door. That stood open,--the bell had long ago ceased,--Mass was"
"over,--and all was profoundly still."
"Out of the warm sunlit air he stepped into the vast, cool,"
"clear-obscure, white glory of the stately shrine,--with bared head and"
"noiseless, reverent feet, he advanced a little way up the nave, and"
"then stood motionless, every artistic perception in him satisfied,"
"soothed, and entranced anew, as in his student-days, by the tranquil"
grandeur of the scene. What majestic silence! What hallowed peace! How
jewel-like the radiance of the sun pouring through the rich stained
"glass on those superb carved pillars, that, like petrified stems of"
"forest-trees, bear lightly up the lofty, vaulted roof to that vast"
height suggestive of a white sky rather than stone!
"Moving on slowly further toward the altar, he was suddenly seized by an"
"overpowering impression,--a memory that rushed upon him with a sort of"
"shock, albeit it was only the memory of a tune!--a wild melody,"
"haunting and passionate, rang in his eras,--the melody that Sarasate,"
"the Orpheus of Spain, had evoked from the heart of his speaking"
"violin,--the sobbing love-lament of the ""Zigeunerweisen""--the weird"
minor-music that had so forcibly suggested--What? THIS VERY
"PLACE!--these snowy columns,--this sculptured sanctity--this flashing"
"light of rose and blue and amber,--this wondrous hush of consecrated"
calm! What next? Dear God! Sweet Christ! what next? The face of
Edris?--Would that heavenly countenance shine suddenly though those
rainbow-colored beams that struck slantwise down toward him?--and
should he presently hear her dulcet voice charming the silence into
deeper ecstasy?
"Overcome by a sensation that was something like fear, he stopped"
"abruptly, and leaning against one of the quaint old oaken benches,"
"strove to control the quick, excited throbbing of his heart,--then"
they cannot abide a foreign domination.
"But the greatest place for Nats is the Popa Mountain, which is an"
extinct volcano standing all alone about midway between the river and
"the Shan Mountains. It is thus very conspicuous, having no hills near it"
"to share its majesty; and being in sight from many of the old capitals,"
it is very well known in history and legend. It is covered with dense
"forest, and the villages close about are few. At the top there is a"
"crater with a broken side, and a stream comes flowing out of this break"
"down the mountain. Probably it was the denseness of its forests, the"
"abundance of water, and its central position, more than its guardian"
"Nats, that made it for so many years the last retreating-place of the"
"half-robber, half-patriot bands that made life so uneasy for us. But the"
Nats of Popa Mountains are very famous.
When any foreigner was taken into the service of the King of Burma he
"had to swear an oath of fidelity. He swore upon many things, and among"
them were included 'all the Nats in Popa.' No Burman would have dared to
"break an oath sworn in such a serious way as this, and they did not"
imagine that anyone else would. It was and is a very dangerous thing to
"offend the Popa Nats; for they are still there in the mountain, and"
everyone who goes there must do them reverence.
"A friend of mine, a police officer, who was engaged in trying to catch"
"the last of the robber chiefs who hid near Popa, told me that when he"
"went up the mountain shooting he, too, had to make offerings. Some way"
"up there is a little valley dark with overhanging trees, and a stream"
"flows slowly along it. It is an enchanted valley, and if you look"
"closely you will see that the stream is not as other streams, for it"
flows uphill. It comes rushing into the valley with a great display of
"foam and froth, and it leaves in a similar way, tearing down the rocks,"
and behaving like any other boisterous hill rivulet; but in the valley
He is a bit of a softy from the look of him. That tender-hearted lot

"""Do you know, Dawson,"" I said, as he went upstairs with me to have a"
"lick and a polish, as he put it--""I am inclined to agree with Cary"
"that you are rather an inhuman beast."""
"My wife, with whom I could exchange no more than a dozen words and a"
"wink or two, gripped the situation and played up to it in the fashion"
which compels the admiration and terror of mere men. Do they humbug
"us, their husbands, as they do the rest of the world on our behalf?"
"She met Dawson as if he were an old family friend, heaped hospitality"
"upon him, and chaffed him blandly as if to entertain a police officer"
with a warrant and handcuffs in his pocket were the best joke in the
"world. ""My husband, Mr. Dawson, needs a holiday very badly, but won't"
take one. He thinks that the war cannot be pursued successfully unless
he looks after it himself. If you would carry him off and keep him
"quiet for a bit, I should be deeply grateful."" She then fell into a"
discussion with Dawson of the most conveniently situated prisons. Mrs.
"Copplestone dismissed Dartmoor and Portland as too bleakly situated,"
but was pleased to approve of Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight--which I
rather fancy is a House of Detention for women. She insisted that the
"climate of the Island was suited to my health, and wrung a promise"
"from Dawson that I should, if possible, be interned there. Dawson's"
manners and conversation surprised me. His homespun origin was
"evident, yet he had developed an easy social style which was neither"
"familiar nor aggressive. We were in his eyes eccentrics, possibly what"
"he would call among his friends ""a bit off,"" and he bore himself"
"towards us accordingly. My small daughter, Jane, to whom he had been"
presented as a colonel of police--little Jane is deeply versed in
"military ranks--took to him at once, and his manner towards her"
confirmed my impression that some vestiges of humanity may still be
and volatile oils.
ACTIONS.--Phenol in large and undiluted doses is an irritant and
"narcotic poison; it is used as an antiseptic, parasiticide, antiferment"
and sometimes used as a local anaesthetic or anodyne in a 2 to 5 per
"cent solution; also as a caustic, but should not be used as a caustic as"
a burn from it heals very slowly.
USES.--Internally as a gastric sedative in small doses for vomiting in
dogs; is administered in various contagious and infectious diseases with
the view of preventing or arresting the development of micro-organisms;
"it coagulates albumen, is not nearly so active as bichloride of mercury;"
1 part to 500 parts of water prevents the growth of anthrax and other
"bacilli. Full doses produce gastro-enteritis, and collapse, which may"
"end fatally; it is a muscular and nerve paralyzer, both internally and"
"externally, it kills by paralyzing the muscles of respiration and the"
"heart. It is chiefly eliminated from the system by the kidneys, giving"
the urine a brownish color.
IN SURGERY.--A three to five per cent solution is used for washing out
"wounds, a two to three per cent for hands, and for itching of the skin,"
"carbolic acid three or four drachms, glycerine two ounces to one pint of"
water. Do not use over large surface on dogs and not at all on cats.
"Phenol treatment for Tetanus, which has given very good results and I"
"would recommend one drachm in three ounces of water, injected"
hypodermically in the region of neck and shoulder every two or three
hours until twelve injections were given and less frequently thereafter.
"DOSES.--Of the phenol: Horses and cattle, 10 to 40 grs.; sheep and pigs,"
"5 to 10 grs.; dogs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 gr., well diluted."

family had more or less indifferently carried for generations. Next to
"winning Nell, his greatest ambition was to raise a Derby"

"The sixth of April, 1917, had caught him with a promising string of"
"yearlings, each an aristocrat in the equine world of blue-bloods, each a"
hope for that most classic of American races. But he had thrown these
upon the hands of a trainer and submerged his personal interests six
"hours after Congress declared war. At the same moment, indeed, all of"
"Kentucky was turning to a greater tradition than that of ""horses and"
"whiskey""; and, by the time the draft became operative, the board of one"
county searched it from end to end without finding a man to
"register--because those in the fighting age, married or single, with"
"dependents or otherwise, had previously rushed to the Colors. This, and"
"the fact that his state, with three others, headed the nation with the"
"highest percentage in physical examinations, added luster to the shield"
of his old Commonwealth--though he roundly insisted that 'twas not
"Kentucky's manhood, but her womanhood, who deserved the credit. After"
"our cruise he was going back to the thoroughbreds, now within a few"
months of the required Derby age; and of course I had promised to be on
hand at Churchill Downs when his colors flashed past the grandstand.
"Late in the afternoon the _Whim_ docked at Key West and, while Gates was"
"ashore arranging for our clearance, Tommy and I ambled up town in search"
of daily papers. We were seated in the office of a rather seedy hotel
"when its proprietor approached, saying:"
"""'Scuse me, gents,--are you from that boat down there?"""
I answered in the affirmative.
policy which opposed the rival house of Saxony. The Pope granted the
"dispensation in return for a great sum of money, but to facilitate its"
payment he accorded to the archbishop a liberal indulgence for the whole
"archbishopric of Mayence, Magdeburg and the Brandenburg territories."
"Albert, to whom half the proceeds were tacitly left, raised a loan with"
"the house of Fugger, and this charged itself with the indulgence"
traffic.
"When in December 1517, Erasmus answered the archbishop, Luther's"
"propositions against indulgences, provoked by the Archbishop of"
"Mayence's instructions regarding their colportage, had already been"
"posted up (31 October 1517), and were circulated throughout Germany,"
rousing the whole Church. They were levelled at the same abuses which
"Erasmus combated, the mechanical, atomistical, and juridical conception"
"of religion. But how different was their practical effect, as compared"
with Erasmus's pacific endeavour to purify the Church by lenient means!
'Lives of saints?' Erasmus asked replying to the archbishop. 'I have
tried in my poor way to add a little light to the prince of saints
"himself. For the rest, your endeavour, in addition to so many difficult"
"matters of government, and at such an early age, to get the lives of the"
"saints purged of old women's tales and disgusting style, is extremely"
laudable. For nothing should be suffered in the Church that is not
"perfectly pure or refined,' And he concludes with a magnificent eulogy"
of the excellent prelate.
"During the greater part of 1518, Erasmus was too much occupied by his"
"own affairs--the journey to Basle and his red-hot labours there, and"
afterwards his serious illness--to concern himself much with Luther's
"business. In March he sends Luther's theses to More, without comment,"
"and, in passing, complains to Colet about the impudence with which Rome"
"disseminates indulgences. Luther, now declared a heretic and summoned to"
highly organized fauna-flora of to-day may be compared to the
"growth of some noble oak as it rises from the acorn, spreading"
loftier and more widely extended branches as it grows.
7. While higher and still higher types have continually been
"evolved, until man, the highest of all, appeared, THE LOWER AND"
EARLIER TYPES HAVE GENERALLY PERSISTED. Some which reached their
culmination early in the history of the earth have since changed
only in slight adjustments to a changing environment. Thus the
"brachiopods, a type of shellfish, have made no progress since the"
"Paleozoic, and some of their earliest known genera are represented"
by living forms hardly to be distinguished from their ancient
ancestors. The lowest and earliest branches of the tree of life
have risen to no higher levels since they reached their climax of
development long ago.
8. A strange parallel has been found to exist between the
evolution of organisms and the development of the individual. In
the embryonic stages of its growth the individual passes swiftly
through the successive stages through which its ancestors evolved
during the millions of years of geologic time. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE INDIVIDUAL RECAPITULATES THE EVOLUTION OF THE RACE.
The frog is a typical amphibian. As a tadpole it passes through a
stage identical in several well-known features with the maturity
"of fishes; as, for example, its aquatic life, the tail by which it"
"swims, and the gills through which it breathes. It is a fair"
inference that the tadpole stage in the life history of the frog
"represents a stage in the evolution of its kind,--that the"
Amphibia are derived from fishlike ancestral forms. This inference
is amply confirmed in the geological record; fishes appeared
before Amphibia and were connected with them by transitional
as an armed force ready to fight for the right of passage. In 1786 the
"Spaniards sought to subdue the territory, built forts on both the"
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and established a line of trading posts
connecting them. But the effort failed. The posts were abandoned. Today
the white man who tries to enter the Darien does so at the risk of his
life.
"In 1854 a navy exploring expedition of twenty-seven men, under command"
"of Lieutenant Isaac C. Strain, entered the jungle of the Darien at"
"Caledonia Bay, on the Atlantic side, the site of Patterson’s ill-fated"
colony. They purposed crossing the Isthmus and making a survey for a
"canal route, as an English adventurer not long before had"
asserted--falsely as it proved--that he had discovered a route by which
a canal could be built with but three or four miles of cutting. The
party carried ten days’ provisions and forty rounds of ball cartridge
"per man. They expected to have to traverse about forty or fifty miles,"
for which the supply of provisions seemed wholly adequate. But when
"they had cut their way through the jungle, waded through swamps and"
climbed hills until their muscles were exhausted and their clothing torn
"to tatters, they found themselves lost in the very interior of the"
Isthmus with all their food gone. Diaries kept by members of the party
show that they lived in constant terror of the Indians. But no attack
was made upon them. The inhabitants contented themselves with
"disappearing before the white men’s advance, sweeping their huts and"
fields clear of any sort of food. The jungle not its people fought the
invaders. For food they had mainly nuts with a few birds and the diet
"disturbed their stomachs, caused sores and loosened their teeth. The"
"bite of a certain insect deposited under the skin a kind of larva, or"
"worm, which grew to the length of an inch and caused the most frightful"
"torments. Despairing of getting his full party out alive, after they had"
"been twenty-three days fighting with the jungle, Strain took three men"
and pushed ahead to secure and send back relief. It was thirty-nine days
"witty and sparkling dramas, and disputed as to whether the ""Old"
"Bachelor"" or the ""Way of the World"" were his happiest effort; whilst"
"some declared that the ""Double Dealer"" was the best of all.  They talked"
"excitedly of the revival at Drury Lane of Farquhar’s ""Love and a"
"Bottle,"" which had scored such a success some fourteen or fifteen years"
previously.  And there were some who lauded and some who depreciated
"Colley Cibber and his ""Careless Husband"" and ""Love’s Last Shift,"" which"
were favourites throughout the town.
"It was a new world to Grey; but he listened with a certain fascination,"
"for the drama had always attracted him, and he watched the gestures of"
the actors and listened to their mouthing periods with something between
wonder and amusement.  He could understand that these men had been
"failures. Only Lionel Field appeared to have any true histrionic gift,"
and the cause of his downfall was plain to be read after the speech of
"the ""Old Lion.""  From time to time, as the light flickered upon the"
"striking face in the ingle, Grey caught a fine-lipped smile upon it, and"
once or twice he thought the old actor’s eyes met his in a gleam of
humour.  But of that he could not be sure—it might be but the trick of
"the firelight; and presently wearied nature asserted itself, and the"
"young man passed from drowsiness to actual sleep, and knew nothing more"
till a sharp grip upon his arm roused him to a sense of his
surroundings.
"It was the tapster who thus shook him; and when he opened his eyes, Grey"
"saw—or thought, at least—that the room was empty.  What the time was he"
"had no idea; but it must be late, and he rose hastily to his feet with a"
muttered apology at having overstayed the closing time.
At that moment there emerged out of the shadows of the ingle-nook a bent
"figure, dignified even in its infirmity, and the voice which Grey had"
heard before spoke in quietly authoritative accents.
"The true occupation for a mind like his was paraphrasing, in which,"
"indeed, he amply indulged. Soothing down and unfolding was just the work"
he liked. It is characteristic that he paraphrased the whole New
Testament except the Apocalypse.
Erasmus's mind was neither philosophic nor historic. His was neither the
"work of exact, logical discrimination, nor of grasping the deep sense of"
the way of the world in broad historical visions in which the
"particulars themselves, in their multiplicity and variegation, form the"
image. His mind is philological in the fullest sense of the word. But by
that alone he would not have conquered and captivated the world. His
mind was at the same time of a deeply ethical and rather strong
aesthetic trend and those three together have made him great.
"The foundation of Erasmus's mind is his fervent desire of freedom,"
"clearness, purity, simplicity and rest. It is an old ideal of life to"
"which he gave new substance by the wealth of his mind. Without liberty,"
life is no life; and there is no liberty without repose. The fact that
he never took sides definitely resulted from an urgent need of perfect
"independence. Each engagement, even a temporary one, was felt as a"
"fetter by Erasmus. An interlocutor in the _Colloquies_, in which he so"
"often, spontaneously, reveals his own ideals of life, declares himself"
"determined neither to marry, nor to take holy orders, nor to enter a"
"monastery, nor into any connection from which he will afterwards be"
unable to free himself--at least not before he knows himself completely.
"'When will that be? Never, perhaps.' 'On no other account do I"
congratulate myself more than on the fact that I have never attached
"myself to any party,' Erasmus says towards the end of his life."
Liberty should be spiritual liberty in the first place. 'But he that is
"spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man,' is"
the word of Saint Paul. To what purpose should he require prescriptions
of Avilion!
"Yet still he kept her close beside him on the steps of the mighty Dom,"
"half-longing, half-hesitating to take her further, and ever and anon"
assailed by a dreamy doubt as to whether she might not even now pass
"away from him suddenly and swiftly, as a mist fading into heaven,--when"
all at once the sound of beating drums and martial trumpets struck
loudly on the quiet morning air. A brilliant regiment of mounted Uhlans
"emerged from an opposite street, and cantered sharply across the Platz"
"and over the Rhine-bridge, with streaming pennons, burnished helmets"
"and accoutrements glistening in a long compact line of silvery white,"
"that vanished as speedily as it had appeared, like a winding flash of"
"meteor flame. Alwyn drew a deep, quick breath; the sight of those armed"
soldiers roused him to the fact that he was actually in the turmoil of
"present daily events,--that his supernal happiness was no vision, but"
"REALITY,--that Edris, his Spirit-love, was with him in tangible human"
"guise of flesh and blood,--though how such a mysterious marvel had been"
"accomplished, he knew no more than scientists know how the lovely life"
of green leaf and perfect flower can still be existent in seeds that
have lain dormant and dry in old tombs for thousands of years! And as
"he looked at her proudly,--adoringly,--she raised her beautiful,"
"innocent, questioning eyes to his."
"""This is a city?"" she asked--""a city of men who labor for good, and"
"serve each other?"""
"""Alas, not so, my sweet!"" he answered, his voice trembling with its own"
"infinite tenderness; ""there is no city on the sad Earth where men do"
"not labor for mere vanity's sake, and oppose each other!"""
Her inquiring gaze softened into a celestial compassion.
detachment. But for us it is a matter of life and death. Upon its issue
depends the question whether our grandchildren are to live in a happier
"world, or are to exterminate each other by scientific methods, leaving"
perhaps to negroes and Papuans the future destinies of mankind.

THE CONWAY MEMORIAL LECTURESHIP
"At a general meeting of the South Place Ethical Society, held on October"
"22, 1908, it was resolved, after full discussion, that an effort should"
"be made to establish a series of lectures, to be printed and widely"
"circulated, as a permanent Memorial to Dr. Conway."
Moncure Conway’s untiring zeal for the emancipation of the human mind
"from the thraldom of obsolete or waning beliefs, his pleadings for"
sympathy with the oppressed and for a wider and profounder conception of
"human fraternity than the world has yet reached, claim, it is urged, an"
offering of gratitude more permanent than the eloquent obituary or
reverential service of mourning.
The range of the lectures (of which the thirteenth is published
herewith) must be regulated by the financial support accorded to the
scheme; but it is hoped that sufficient funds will be eventually
forthcoming for the endowment of periodical lectures by distinguished
"public men, to further the cause of social, political, and religious"
"freedom, with which Dr. Conway’s name must ever be associated."
"All at once, moved by a sudden impulse, he turned toward the right hand"
"side of the altar, where the great statue of St. Christopher stands,"
and where one of the loveliest windows in the world gleams like a great
"carven gem aloft, filtering the light through a myriad marvellous"
"shades of color, and there he beheld, kneeling on the stone pavement,"
"one solitary worshipper,--a girl. Her hands were clasped, and her face"
"was bent upon them so that her features were not visible,--but the"
"radiance from the window fell on her uncovered golden hair, encircling"
"it with the glistening splendor of a heavenly nimbus,--and round her"
"slight, devotional figure, rays of azure and rose jasper and emerald,"
"flickered in wide and lustrous patterns, like the glow of the setting"
sun on a translucent sea. How very still she was! ... how fervently
absorbed in prayer!
"Vaguely startled, and thrilled by an electric, indefinable instinct,"
"Alwyn went toward her with hushed and reverential tread, his eyes"
"dwelling upon the drooping, delicate outline of her form with"
"fascinated and eager attention. She was clad in gray,--a soft, silken,"
"dove-like gray, that clung about her in picturesque, daintily draped"
"folds,--he approached her still more nearly, and then could scarcely"
refrain from a loud cry of amazement! What flowers were those she wore
"at her breast!--so white, so star-like, so suggestive of paradise"
lilies new-gathered? Were they not the flowers of ARDATH? Dizzy with
"the sudden tumult of his own emotions, he dropped on his knees beside"
"her,--she did not stir! Was she REAL?--or a phantom? Trembling"
"violently, he touched her garment--it was of tangible, smooth texture,"
"actual enough, if the sense of touch could be relied upon. In an agony"
"of excitement and suspense he lost all remembrance of time, place, or"
"custom,--her bewildering presence must be explained,--he must know who"
"she was,--he must speak to her,--speak, if he died for it!"
"""Pardon me!"" he whispered faintly, scarcely conscious of his own words;"
Her strange behavior at that time had affected him more deeply than he
would have thought possible; and while he had purposely avoided
"thinking much about the banker's sudden change of front, back of his"
"devout thankfulness for the miracle was a vague suspicion, a curious"
feeling that made him uncomfortable in the girl's presence. He could
"not repent his determination to win at any price; yet he shrank, with a"
"moral cowardice which made him inwardly writhe, from owning that Cherry"
had made the sacrifice at which Clyde and the others had hinted. If it
"were indeed true, it placed him in an intolerable position, wherein he"
could express neither his gratitude nor his censure. No doubt she had
"read the signs of his mental confusion, and her own delicate"
sensibility had responded to it.
They remained side by side on the bridge while the day died amidst a
"wondrous panoply of color, each busied with thoughts that might not be"
"spoken, in their hearts emotions oddly at variance. The sky ahead of"
"them was wide-streaked with gold, as if for a symbol, interlaid with"
sooty clouds in silhouette; on either side the mountains rose from
penumbral darkness to clear-cut heights still bright from the slanting
radiance. Here and there along the shadowy shore-line a light was born;
the smell of the salt sea was in the air. Above the rhythmic pulse of
"the steamer rose the voices of men singing between decks, while the"
parting waters at the prow played a soft accompaniment. A steward
"summoned them to supper, but Boyd refused, saying he could not eat, and"
the girl stayed with him while the miles slowly slipped past and the
night encompassed them.
"""Two hours more,"" he told her, as the ship's bell sounded. ""Then I can"
"eat and sleep--and sing."""
Captain Peasley was pacing the bridge when later they breasted the
Once upon a time there was a king who had several sons; I do not just
"know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home,"
and insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. And in
the end the king had to give him permission to do so. After he had
"wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service"
with the giant. In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his
"goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the"
"stable in the meantime. ""And when you are through with that, you need"
"do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have"
"come to a kind master,"" said he. ""But you must do what you are told to"
"do conscientiously and, besides, you must not go into any of the rooms"
"that lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else your life"
"will pay the forfeit."""
"""He surely is a kind master,"" said the king's son to himself, walked up"
"and down the room, and whistled and sang; for, thought he, there would"
"be plenty of time to clean the stable. ""But it would be nice to take a"
"look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is"
"alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he,"
"and went into the first room. There hung a kettle, and it was boiling,"
"but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ""What can there be in"
"it?"" thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair"
"grew just like copper. ""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will"
"burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. There hung"
another kettle that bubbled and boiled; but there was no fire beneath
"it, either. ""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again"
"he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ""We have"
"no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main"
"thing is, how does it taste?"" and with that he went into the third room."
"And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling just like those in the"
"two other rooms, and the king's son wanted to try this one, too. He"
"quittance of earth?--and have I so soon won the privilege to die?"""
"As he spoke, she rose and stood erect, with all the glistening light of"
"the stained window falling royally about her,--and he obeying her mute"
"gesture, rose also and faced her in wondering ecstasy, half expecting"
to see her vanish suddenly in the sun-rays that poured through the
"Cathedral, even as she had vanished before like a white cloud absorbed"
"in clear space. But no! She remained quiet as a tame bird,--her eyes"
"met his with beautiful trust and tenderness,--and when she answered"
"him, her low, sweet accents thrilled to his heart with a pathetic note"
"of HUMAN affection, as well as of angelic sympathy!"
"""Theos, my Beloved, I am ALL THINE!"" she said, a holy rapture vibrating"
"through her exquisite voice.--""Thine now, in mortal life as in"
"immortal!--one with thee in nature and condition,--pent up in"
"perishable clay, even as thou art,--subject to sorrow, and pain, and"
"weariness,--willing to share with thee thine earthly lot,--ready to"
take my part in thy grief or joy! By mine own choice have I come
"hither,--sinless, yet not exempt from sin, but safe in Christ! Every"
"time thou hast renounced the desire of thine own happiness, so much the"
nearer hast thou drawn me to thee; every time thou hast prayed God for
"my peace, rather than thine own, so much the closer has my existence"
"been linked with thine! And now, O my Poet, my lord, my king!--we are"
"together forever more,--together in the brief Present, as in the"
"eternal Future!--the solitary heaven-days of Edris are past, and her"
"mission is not Death, but Love!"""
"Oh, the transcendent beauty of that warm flush upon her face!--the"
"splendid hope, faith, and triumph of her attitude! What strange miracle"
"was here accomplished!--an Angel had become human for the sake of love,"
even as light substantiates itself in the colors of flowers!--the Eden
"lily had consented to be gathered,--the paradise dove had fluttered"
"original plank bearing the inscription, ""_Jesus, Nazarene King_,"" in"
"Hebrew, Greek and Latin, which was placed over his head; also one"
"of the nails used in his crucifixion, and two of the thorns of his"
crown; besides a large piece of the cross of the penitent thief who was
"executed with him; and, most interesting of all in some respects, the"
finger used by Thomas to resolve his doubts as to the resurrection of
Christ (John xx. 24-28).
[Sidenote: A Bottle of The Blood of Christ.]
"In Percy's _Romanism_ it is said that ""the list of relics on the right"
"of the apsis of S. Croce includes the finger of S. Thomas, apostle,"
with which he touched the most holy side of our Lord Jesus Christ; one
of the pieces of money with which the Jews paid the treachery of Judas;
great part of the veil and of the hair of the most blessed Virgin; a
"mass of cinders and charcoal united in the form of a loaf, with the fat"
"of S. Lawrence, martyr; one bottle of the most precious blood of our"
Lord Jesus Christ; another of the milk of the most blessed Virgin; a
little piece of the stone where Christ was born; a little piece of the
stone where our Lord sat when he pardoned Mary Magdalene; of the stone
where our Lord wrote the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai; of the
stone where reposed SS. Peter and Paul; of the cotton which collected
the blood of Christ; of the manna which fed the Israelites; of the rod
of Aaron which flourished in the desert; of the relics of the eleven
"prophets!""[11]"
But our party saw none of these except the finger of Thomas. It is
"to be hoped that the others have been withdrawn from exhibition, for"
"surely superstition and vulgarity can no further go. I fear, however,"
"that those who are willing to pay enough can still see ""one bottle of"
"the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,"" and ""another of the"
"milk of the most blessed Virgin""! There is also ""_una ampulla lactis"
"with the head of a lamb[51], devastation will take place in the"
country.
"If an ewe gives birth to six, confusion among the population."
"If an ewe gives birth to seven,--three male and four female--, the"
king will perish.
"If an ewe gives birth to eight, approach of an usurper, the tribute"
of the king will be withheld.
"If an ewe gives birth to nine, end of the dynasty."
"If an ewe gives birth to ten, a weakling will acquire universal"
sovereignty[52].
The general similarity of the interpretations may be taken as a further
indication that the =bârû=-priests were simply giving their fancy free
scope in making prognostications for conditions that could never arise;
nor is it of serious moment that in the case of triplets the
"interpretation is favorable to the owner of the ewe, or that in the case"
"of ten lambs, even the official interpretation is not distinctly"
unfavorable--in view of the purely 'academic' character of such entries.
An extract from a long text[53] furnishing omens derived from all kinds of
peculiarities and abnormal phenomena noted on the ears of an
"animal--primarily again the sheep, though no doubt assumed to be"
applicable to other domesticated animals--will throw further light on the
"system of divination devised by the =bârû=-priests, and will also"
illustrate the extravagant fancy of the priests in their endeavor to make
their collections provide for all possible and indeed for many impossible
contingencies.
there was at least a chance that they might bring to a successful
conclusion the complex and difficult task which was before them.

"They now drew near to the palace, which, as one descends the mountains,"
"is approached first. The town of San Ildefonso lay further to the right,"
an indistinguishable mass of heaped roofs and turrets without a light or
the vestige of a street apparent in the gloom. It seemed to Rollo a
strange thing to think of this stricken town lying there with its dead
"and dying, its empty tawdry lodgings from which the rich and gay of the"
"Court had fled so hastily, leaving all save their most precious"
"belongings behind, the municipal notices on the door, white crosses"
"chalked on a black ground, while nearer and always nearer approached the"
fell gipsy rabble intent on plunder and rapine.
"Even more strange, however, seemed the case of the royal palace of La"
Granja. Erected at infinite cost after the pattern of Versailles and
"Marly, the smallness of its scale and the magnificence of its natural"
surroundings caused it infinitely to surpass either of its models in
"general effect. It had, however, never been intended for defence, nor"
had the least preparation been made in case of attack. It was doubtless
"presumed that whenever the Court sojourned there, the royal personages"
"would arrive with such a guard and retinue as, in that lonely place,"
would make danger a thing to be laughed at.
But no such series of circumstances as this had ever been thought of;
the plague which had fallen so heavily and as it seemed mysteriously and
instantaneously upon the town; the precincts of the palace about to be
invaded by a foe more fell than Frank or Moor; the guards disappeared
"like snow in the sun, and the only protection of the lives of the"
"Queen-Regent and her daughter, a band of Carlists sent to capture their"
mainly upon his fists. Blows were rained upon him from unguarded
"quarters, he was kicked, battered, and flung about, his blind instinct"
finally leading him to clinch with whomsoever his hands encountered.
"Then a sudden blackness swallowed him up, after which he found himself"
"upon his knees, his arms loosely encircling a pair of legs, and"
realized that he had been half-stunned by a blow from behind. The legs
"he was clutching tried to kick him loose, at which he summoned all his"
"strength, knowing that he must go down no further; but as he struggled"
"upward, something smote him in the side with sickening force, and he"
went to his knees again.
"Close beside him he saw the club he had dropped, and endeavored to"
"reach it; but before he could do so, a hand snatched it away and he"
"heard a voice cursing above him. A second time he tried to rise, but"
his shocked nerves failed to transmit the impulse to his muscles; he
could only raise his shoulder and fling an arm weakly above his head in
anticipation of the crushing blow he knew was coming. But it did not
"descend, Instead, he heard a gun shot--that sound for which his ears"
had been strained from the first--and then for an instant he wondered
"if it had been directed at himself. A weight sank across his calves,"
"the legs he had been holding broke away from his grasp; then, with a"
"final effort, he pulled himself free and staggered to his feet, his"
"head rocking, his knees sagging. He saw a man's figure facing him, and"
"lunged at it, to bring up in the arms of ""Fingerless"" Fraser, who cried"
sharply:
"""Are you hurt, Bo?"""
"Too dazed to answer, he turned and beheld the body of a man stretched"
"face downward on the floor. Beyond, the fellow in the gray suit was"
disappearing into the crowd. Even yet Boyd did not realize whence the
"shot had come, although the smell of powder was sharp in his nostrils."
"""Come, gezabo, let's court Dame Roulette! Join us, Jack?"""
"This I declined, and watched them move off arm in arm. But a strange"
"thing arrested my attention for, as they preceded down the corridor, I"
saw a man in yachting clothes--the uniform of a captain--draw quickly
back into an alcove as if wanting to escape discovery. When they had
"passed he looked out, more fearfully than curiously, and after a moment"
of indecision slowly followed them. Urged by a suspicion that this was
"in some way associated with the professor, I arose and also followed."
Yet upon reaching the salon the stranger was nowhere to be seen. Tommy
"and Monsieur were each buying a stack of chips, the place seemed quiet"
"and orderly, so without being observed I returned to my table."
"Now left alone I leaned back, idly twisting the stem of my glass,"
looking over the sea of merry people who made a picture that quickened
interest. For I am particularly fond of sitting apart and watching an
"assemblage of handsomely groomed men and women laughing, talking and"
making love. I like to guess whether fears or tears or desperate courage
hide behind their gayety; whether the rapidly wagging tongues are
uttering inanities or planning naughty things; whether the love-making
"will stop with coffee and liqueur, or, lighted by them, burn into"
eternity.
All phases of human banality and human enigma seemed to be represented.
There were languid beauties of the Latin type whose drooping eyes might
"have expressed _ennui_, passion, pride--anything, in fact, that one's"
"humor chose to fancy; the blonde by adoption was there, with heavy"
"ear-rings of jet, whose habit was that of looking slant-wise through her"
"cigarette smoke and raising one black, though carefully plucked,"
"eyebrow; also there were a few American women, by far the most smartly"
dressed. Great was the throb of life in this discreet and fashionable
feared. He is such a great Nat that it is necessary when you pass his
house to dismount from your pony and walk to a respectful distance. If
"you haughtily ride past, trouble will befall you. A friend of mine"
riding there one day rejected all the advice of his Burmese companions
"and did not dismount, and a few days later he was taken deadly sick of"
"fever. He very nearly died, and had to go away to the Straits for a"
sea-trip to take the fever out of his veins. It was a very near thing
"for him. That was in the Burmese times, of course. After that he always"
dismounted. But all Nats are not so proud nor so much to be feared as
"this one, and it is usually safe to ride past."
Even as I write I am under the shadow of a tree where a Nat used to
"live, and the headman of the village has been telling me all about it."
"This is a Government rest-house on a main road between two stations, and"
is built for Government officials travelling on duty about their
districts. To the west of it is a grand fig-tree of the kind called
"Nyaungbin by the Burmese. It is a very beautiful tree, though now a"
"little bare, for it is just before the rains; but it is a great tree"
"even now, and two months hence it will be glorious. It was never"
"planted, the headman tells me, but came up of itself very many years"
"ago, and when it was grown to full size a Nat came to live in it. The"
"Nat lived in the tree for many years, and took great care of it. No one"
"might injure it or any living creature near it, so jealous was the Nat"
"of his abode. And the villagers built a little Nat-house, such as I have"
"described, under the branches, and offered flowers and water, and all"
things went well with those who did well. But if anyone did ill the Nat
"punished him. If he cut the roots of the tree, the Nat hurt his feet;"
"and if he injured the branches, the Nat injured his arms; and if he cut"
"the trunk, the Nat came down out of the tree, and killed the"
"sacrilegious man right off. There was no running away, because, as you"
"know, the headman said, Nats can go a great deal faster than any man."
"Many men, careless strangers, who camped under the tree and then abused"
"England the priest solemnly instructs the god-parents of the child,"
"“Ye shall call upon him to hear sermons,” but for the most part the"
"admonition is in vain. As a matter of fact, he picks up his religious"
notions from the newspaper press. And the newspaper press is not now
controlled by men who have a distinct and definite belief in
"Christianity. It depends upon Finance, and financiers have other"
"interests. The assertion of the Psalter, “Notus in Judæa” has been"
"changed now-a-days into an interrogation, and we ask, “In Jewry _is_"
God known?” Let any man who has an intimate acquaintance with the
newspaper world run over in his mind the names of the great newspaper
"proprietors, the editors of our journalistic press, the writers of"
"leading articles, the rising young journalists; and when he has"
"excepted a few Irishmen, who may happen to remain faithful to the"
"Roman Catholic Church, to which they owe their education, how many men"
"will he find who honestly believe the Nicene Creed, and are habitually"
present on the first day of the week at the Breaking of the Bread?
The tone of the daily paper is tolerant. There is no rude hostility
"displayed towards definite Christian doctrines, but the toleration is"
"politely contemptuous. “All wise men are of the same religion, and"
what that religion is wise men do not say.”
It is true that in political matters the press has less power than it
used to have. A magnate of finance cannot now seriously affect public
"opinion, though he may buy newspaper after newspaper, and sweep out"
the editorial staff to supply their places with men of his own choice.
One wealthy wirepuller has other plutocrats to reckon with in
"questions of party politics, and a newspaper man who is dismissed by"
the proprietor of the _Tariff Reformer_ may find another editorial
chair placed at his disposal by the owner of _The Standard of Free
Trade_.
"Gerard, who did the infamous deed, actually told his judges 'that he"
"would soon be a saint in heaven, and would have the first place there"
"next to God,' whilst his family received a patent of nobility, and"
entered into the possession of the estate of the Prince in the Franche
Comté--rewards promised for the commission of the crime by Cardinal
"Granvelle."" (Dr. Alexander Robertson's _Roman Catholic Church in"
"Italy_, p. 94.)"
These are some of the things that help to explain not only the tone
"of the pasquinades, not only the indictments of the world's leading"
"historians, which are to be presently cited, but also the present"
attitude of something like twenty millions of the thirty-odd millions
"of Italy's inhabitants, who have forsaken the church altogether."
What idea the people have of the Jesuits in particular is well shown
"by the legend connected with the Piazza del Gesu, the great open space"
"in front of the Jesuit church, which is considered the windiest place"
in Rome. The story is that the devil and the wind were one day taking a
"walk together. ""When they came to this square, the devil, who seemed to"
"be very devout, said to the wind, 'Just wait a minute, mio caro, while"
"I go into this church.' So the wind promised, and the devil went into"
"the Gesu, and has never come out again--and the wind is blowing about"
"in the Piazza del Gesu to this day."""
[Sidenote: Pasquino's View of the Pope.]
One of the interesting objects in Rome is a mutilated statue called
"Pasquino, which stands at the corner of the Orsini Palace, one of"
the most central and public places in the city. The reason for the
interest attaching to this almost shapeless piece of marble is that
for centuries it was used for placarding those satires upon the popes
"which, by their exceeding cleverness and biting truth, have made the"
"people of pernicious vows, if only they repent of them,' says the man"
who himself had broken a vow.
There is in Erasmus a dangerous fusion between inclination and
conviction. The correlations between his idiosyncrasies and his precepts
are undeniable. This has special reference to his point of view in the
matter of fasting and abstinence from meat. He too frequently vents his
"own aversion to fish, or talks of his inability to postpone meals, not"
to make this connection clear to everybody. In the same way his personal
"experience in the monastery passes into his disapproval, on principle,"
of monastic life.
"The distortion of the image of his youth in his memory, to which we have"
"referred, is based on that need of self-justification. It is all"
unconscious interpretation of the undeniable facts to suit the ideal
which Erasmus had made of himself and to which he honestly thinks he
answers. The chief features of that self-conceived picture are a
"remarkable, simple sincerity and frankness, which make it impossible to"
him to dissemble; inexperience and carelessness in the ordinary concerns
of life and a total lack of ambition. All this is true in the first
"instance: there is a superficial Erasmus who answers to that image, but"
it is not the whole Erasmus; there is a deeper one who is almost the
opposite and whom he himself does not know because he will not know him.
"Possibly because behind this there is a still deeper being, which is"
truly good.
"Does he not ascribe weaknesses to himself? Certainly. He is, in spite of"
"his self-coddling, ever dissatisfied with himself and his work."
"_Putidulus_, he calls himself, meaning the quality of never being"
content with himself. It is that peculiarity which makes him
"dissatisfied with any work of his directly after it has appeared, so"
that he always keeps revising and supplementing. 'Pusillanimous' he
done for those who left school for ever when they were twelve years
old.
"A generation ago Lord Sherbrooke, on the extension of the franchise,"
told his contemporaries that it was time to begin “to educate our
masters”--but we have not gone very far in our instruction of
"Christian Sociology, though as yet we have not adopted the Utilitarian"
"basis of morals accepted by the French Republic, and endeavoured to"
establish principles of duty towards man without any reference
whatever to a duty towards God.
Can any one be surprised if the plain man be perplexed when he is
called upon to decide questions of economy and morality without any
guiding principle? As a matter of fact he makes no such effort.
"“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the day of the"
"Lord is near in the valley of decisions,” but the sun and the moon are"
"darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The puzzled popular"
"vote is but as the swing of the pendulum, first to this side, then to"
"the other. “These fellows have been no good, let us give the others a"
show.”
Yet assuredly there is a principle which is guidance and strength if
only men could discern it. There are Teachers who can tell men of its
"beneficent power, but they are as yet few in number, and their voices"
"are not sufficiently strong. When once these can get a hearing, men"
welcome their evangel and find in it a guide of life.
"I am persuaded that just as Bishop Butler, when he perused the preface"
"of his _Analogy_, had no prescience of the young fellow of Lincoln,"
who was in a few years to give the Christian faith a fresh hold in the
"hearts of the common people, who gladly heard him, so in our time many"
of our Bishops seem unable to perceive the dawn of another “day of the
"him. ""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant,"
and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner; but there was
"nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and"
he did not know whether it were mush or porridge. When he noticed this
"he began to see a light, and realize how matters had come to pass, and"
"he grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do, and made after the"
king's son and the Master Girl in flying haste. In a short time he came
"to the sea, and could not cross. ""But I know how to help myself,"" said"
"he. ""I will fetch my sea-sucker."" So the sea-sucker came, and lay down"
"and took two or three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that the"
"giant could see the king's son and the Master Girl out on the ship. ""Now"
"you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the"
king's son did so. It turned into a tremendous large rock square across
"the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could"
"drink up no more of the sea. ""I know quite well what I must do,"" said"
"the giant. ""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" So the hill-borer came, and"
"bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and"
keep on sucking. But no sooner were they thus far than the Master Girl
"told the king's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and"
the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker could so
much as take a single swallow.
Now they wanted to go home to the father of the king's son; but he would
"not hear of the Master Girl's going afoot, since he did not think this"
"fitting for either of them. ""Wait here a little while, until I fetch the"
"seven horses that stand in my father's stable,"" said the king's son. ""It"
"is not far, and I will soon be back; for I will not have my bride come"
"marching home afoot."" ""No, do not do so, for when you get home to the"
"castle you will forget me, I know that positively,"" said the Master"
"Girl. ""How could I forget you?"" said the king's son. ""We have passed"
"through so many hardships together, and we love each other so dearly,"""
"said he. He wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and"
"could be at peace, and the monk answered for the governor that all his"
"land was at their disposal. 'Let the Nats choose,' he said; 'all the"
"country is before them.' So the Nats chose, and said that they would"
"have Popa Mountain, and the monk agreed."
"The Nats then left the tree and went away, far away inland, to the great"
"Popa Mountain, and took up their abode there, and all the people there"
"feared and reverenced them, and even made to their honour two statues"
with golden heads and set them up on the mountain.
"This is the story of the Popa Nats, the greatest Nats of all the"
"country of Burma, the guardian spirits of the mysterious mountain. The"
"golden heads of the statues are now in one of our treasuries, put there"
"for safe custody during the troubles, though it is doubtful if even then"
"anyone would have dared to steal them, so greatly are the Nats feared."
And the hunters and the travellers there must offer to the Nats little
"offerings, if they would be safe in these forests, and even the young"
man must obtain permission from the Nats before he marry.
"I think these stories that I have told, stories selected from very many"
"that I have heard, will show what sort of spirits these are that the"
Burmese have peopled their trees and rivers with; will show what sort of
"religion it is that underlies, without influencing, the creed of the"
"Buddha that they follow. It is of the very poetry of superstition, free"
"from brutality, from baseness, from anything repulsive, springing, as I"
"have said, from their innate sympathy with Nature and recognition of the"
life that works in all things. It always seems to me that beliefs such
"as these are a great key to the nature of a people, are, apart from all"
"interest in their beauty, and in their akinness to other beliefs, of"
great value in trying to understand the character of a nation.
For to beings such as Nats and fairies the people who believe in them
the soldiers by their careworn faces; or that many a man stood morning
and evening to gaze at the carved and lofty front of his house--by St.
Sebald's or behind the new Cathedral--and wondered how long the fire
would spare it. The magistrates who had staked all--their own and the
"city's--on this cast, went about with stern, grave faces and feared"
"almost to meet the public eye. With a doubled population, with a huge"
"army to feed, with order to keep, with houses and wives and daughters"
"of their own to protect, with sack and storm looming luridly in the"
"future, who had cares like theirs?"
"One man only, and him I saw as we went home from the Burg. It was near"
"the foot of the Burg hill, where the strasse meets three other ways."
"At that time Count Tilly's crooked, dwarfish figure and pale horse's"
"face, and the great hat and boots which seemed to swallow him up, were"
fresh in my mind; and sometimes I had wondered whether this other
"great commander were like him. Well, I was to know; for through the"
"crowd at the junction of these four roads, while we stood waiting to"
"pass, there came a man on a white horse, followed by half a score of"
others on horseback; and in a moment I knew from the shouting and the
way women thrust papers into his hands that we saw the King of Sweden.
He wore a plain buff coat and a grey flapped hat with a feather; a
"tall man and rather bulky, his face massive and fleshy, with a close"
moustache trimmed to a point and a small tuft on his chin. His aspect
"was grave; he looked about him with a calm eye, and the shouting did"
"not seem to move him. They told me that it was Ba[=n]er, the Swedish"
"General, who rode with him, and our Bernard of Weimar who followed."
"But my eye fell more quickly on Count Leuchtenstein, who rode after,"
"with the great Chancellor Oxenstierna; in him, in his steady gaze and"
"serene brow and wholesome strength, I traced the nearest likeness to"
the king.
"crew turned pirates, and sailed to the Red Sea. Here he met with a great"
"Indian ship, which he had the hardiness to attack, and soon took her, and"
"each of his men received as his share £3,000, and with this booty they"
sailed to Madagascar. He was already held in high esteem by the pirates
"who resided in that favourite stronghold. At one time he joined Misson,"
"the originator of ""piracy-without-tears"" at his garden city of Libertatia."
A quarrel arose between Misson's French followers and Tew's English
"pirates. A duel was arranged between the two leaders, but by the tact of"
"another pirate--an unfrocked Italian priest--all was settled amicably, Tew"
being appointed Admiral and the diplomatic ex-priest suitably chosen as
Secretary of State to the little republic. Such a reputation for kindness
"had Tew that ships seldom resisted him, but on knowing who their assailant"
was they gave themselves up freely. Some of Tew's men started a daughter
"colony on their own account, and the Admiral sailed after them to try and"
"persuade them to return to the fold at Libertatia. The men refused, and"
"while Tew was arguing and trying to persuade them to change their minds,"
his ship was lost in a sudden storm. Tew was soon rescued by the ship
"_Bijoux_ with Misson on board, who, with a few men, had escaped being"
"massacred by the natives. Misson, giving Tew an equal share of his gold"
"and diamonds, sailed away, while Tew managed to return to Rhode Island in"
"New England, where he settled down for a while. To show the honesty of"
"this man, being now affluent, he kept a promise to the friends in Bermuda"
"who originally set him up with a ship, by sending them fourteen times the"
original cost of the sloop as their just share of the profits.
"At last, Tew found the call of the sea and the lure of the ""grand account"""
"too great to resist, and he consented to take command of a pirate ship"
"which was to go on a cruise in the Red Sea. Arrived there, Tew attacked a"
"big ship belonging to the Great Mogul, and during the battle was mortally"
wounded.
"His historian tells us ""a shot carried away the rim of Tew's belly, who"
shall change all that some day; but what does a bachelor want with such
a house as this?  What should I be the better for a crowd of liveried
"servants, eating off their heads, idling away their time dicing and"
drinking?  What have I to give an army of scullions and cooks to do—I
"who seldom take a meal at home after my morning chocolate?  No, no; I"
know a trick worth two of that. I don’t ruin myself to keep a crew of
"fat, lazy rogues about me, cheating me at every turn.  Half a dozen"
fellows and a few kitchen wenches do well enow for me; but when Lady
Sandford comes to her husband’s home—ah well! then we shall see the
"difference."""
But though he talked jestingly from time to time of the Lady Sandford
"that was to be, he gave Grey no hint as to whether his fancy inclined"
more to one or another of the many gay maidens with whom he chatted and
"flirted, danced and romped, in the fashion of the day; and so"
bewildering and dazzling were these young madams and their surroundings
"that the newcomer was lost in a maze of wonder and bewilderment, and"
"found it hard to distinguish one face from another, until he met one,"
different from all the rest.
But Grey was not left idle; he had small time for musing.  The very
first day of his sojourn in London he was surrounded by a fluttering
"crowd of tailors, glove-sellers, barbers, fencers, sellers and purveyors"
"of every imaginable ware, who all professed their eagerness to serve"
"him, and quoted Lord Sandford as a patron who could swear to their"
honesty and the excellence of their goods.
"Into the midst of this motley throng Lord Sandford thrust himself,"
"laughing his great hearty laugh, and quickly sent to the right-about"
"two-thirds of the importunate crowd—a jest here, a keen thrust there, a"
"slap on back or shoulder in another quarter, emphasizing his forcible"
"hints.  And when the room was cleared of all but the lucky few, he flung"
because of the extraordinary uses and associations of it within the
last thousand years.

"So, regardless of the wet, cold, foggy weather that we found in"
"Milan, and the rivers of mud and slush that were then doing duty for"
"streets, and the splotches of snow that lay here and there in the"
"forlorn-looking olive orchards, we took the electric tram, which was"
"comfortably heated, and ran out to Monza, a distance of some ten miles."
"When we stepped into the chilly cathedral and looked about us, we could"
"not at first see anybody to show us around, though there were a good"
many poor people saying their prayers there. Evidently the custodians
were not expecting tourists at such a season and in such weather.
"But presently, in an apartment to the left, we found a number of the"
priests warming their hands over a dish of twig coals covered with a
"light layer of white ashes, which they kindly stirred a little to make"
them give forth more heat as they saw us stretch our cold hands also
towards the grateful warmth.
[Sidenote: The Treasury of the Cathedral.]
"When we asked if we could see the Iron Crown, they said we could; but"
"instead of going at once to the chapel in which it is kept, they got a"
"great bag of keys, large keys, thirty-seven in number, as the observant"
"statistician of our party ascertained, and led us into the treasury and"
"unlocked a great number of doors (one of which had seven locks), and"
showed us the costly objects and precious relics above mentioned. We
"were only mildly interested in these--even in the apostolic baskets,"
"the Virgin's veil, and John the Baptist's tooth--partly because we were"
so cold and partly because of our greater interest in the more famous
relic which we had come especially to see.

"next morning, when the temperature was still near freezing, and"
during the day continuous fighting prevented any chance of
"operation. The man steadily sank during the day, and died"
thirty-six hours after the reception of the injury.
"_Post-mortem condition._--Belly not distended, dull anteriorly"
"in patches, and right flank dull throughout. When the belly was"
"opened, extensive adhesion of omentum and intestine enclosing"
"numerous collections of pus were disclosed, and on disturbing"
the adhesions a large collection of turbid blood-stained fluid
was set free from the right loin. The great omentum was much
"thickened and matted, with deposition of thick patches of"
lymph; very firm recent adhesions also united numerous coils of
"small intestine. The pus was foetid, but no appreciable"
quantity of intestinal contents was detected in it. The lower
"half or more of the small intestine was injected, reddened, and"
thickened. The wounds which were situated in the lower part of
"the jejunum and ileum were multiple, and seven perforations"
were detected; besides these the intestine was marked by
"bruises, and some gutter slits affecting the serous and"
muscular coats only. Considerable ecchymosis surrounded these
"latter. The clean perforations were circular, less than 1/4"
"inch in diameter, and for the most part closed by eversion of"
"the mucous membrane. Intestinal contents were not apparent, but"
escaped freely on manipulation of the bowel.

St. Helena period. I wish here to record my grateful obligations for
"all these friendly courtesies, which have given value to the book,"

"[NOTE.--The references to Napoleon's ""Correspondence"" in the notes are"
"to the official French edition, published under the auspices of"
"Napoleon III. The ""New Letters of Napoleon"" are those edited by Léon"
"Lecestre, and translated into English by Lady Mary Loyd, except in a"
Flag Days and to Our Own Day; besides enriching a number of
semi-fraudulent war charities which had alluring titles.
"But if, from paying handsomely to all these praise-worthy endeavours"
"to mitigate the horrors of war, she proceeded to render personal"
"service, she became the despair of the paid organizers and"
business-like workers. She couldn't add and she couldn't subtract or
divide with any certainty of a correct result; she couldn't spell
the more difficult words or remember the right letters to put after
distinguished persons' names when she addressed envelopes in her
"large, childish handwriting; she couldn't be trusted to make"
enquiries or to detect fraudulent appeals. She lost receipts and
never grasped the importance of vouchers; she forgot to fill up
"counterfoils, or if reminded filled them up ""from memory"" so that"
"they didn't tally; she signed her name, if there was any choice of"
"blank spaces, in quite the wrong place."
"So, invariably, tactful secretaries or assistant secretaries were"
"told off to explain to her--ever so nicely--that ""she was no"
"business woman"" (this, to the daughter of wholesale manufacturers,"
"sounded rather flattering), and that though she was invaluable as a"
"""name,"" as a patroness, or one of eighteen Vice Presidents, she was"
of no use whatever as a worker.
She had no country house to place at the disposal of the Government
as a convalescent home. Michael after a few experiments forbade her
offering any hospitality at No. 1 Park Crescent to invalid officers.
Such as were entrusted to her in the spring of 1915 soon found that
"she was--as they phrased it--""a pompous little, middle-class fool,"""
wielding no authority. They larked in the laboratory with Red Cross
"nurses, broke specimens, and did very unkind and noisy things ..."
"besides smoking in both the large _and_ the small dining-rooms. So,"
public and attributed to Kodama containing some military indications on
the plan of an invasion of Indo-China is a perfect forgery. I have
exposed elsewhere several technical errors therein which would never
appear in an authentic official document. But whether it is authentic or
"not, I do not attach any importance to the matter, from a political"
point of view at least. It is the duty of all the military and naval
"authorities to keep themselves ready for any emergency. For example,"
France ought to keep herself always prepared for any possible
"difficulties which may arise on her frontiers in the east, and in the"
"south, and on the western coasts; the same with Germany, with Austria,"
"with Italy, even with the United States."
"It appears to me that, if the general staff-office of France or of"
"Germany, or the military or naval authorities of any country whatever,"
were to remain without the least knowledge as to what measure should be
"taken in case of a danger, they would be neglecting their duty to their"
"country. I can then say that all the Japanese officers, both in the army"
and in the navy ought to study constantly the measures which Japan
should take in any emergency. I believe it is the same in every country
"in Europe. This, however, does not belong to the sphere of practical"
politics. It is the duty of statesmen and politicians to maintain a
"friendly relationship with all other countries as far as possible; and,"
"consequently, to keep absolute control over their armies and navies. The"
"army and navy ought to serve as instruments and machines in their hands,"
"and not they, the civilians, become the instruments of the army and"
navy. You may be quite assured that in Japan the army and navy are the
"machines of the statesmen, and that the statesmen are not their"
machines.
Can the fabrication of the so-called Kodama report be demonstrated
by a precise fact?
"Blackwoods' saloon, a recognisable but idealistic likeness,"
"that Ferrier remarked, 'I should call that the pursuit of"
beauty under difficulties.'
"During her infancy Edinburgh had become Mrs. Ferrier's home, though she"
"made frequent visits to Westmorland, of whose dialect she had a"
"complete command. The courtship, however, had been for the most part"
"carried on at the picturesque old house of Gorton, where 'Christopher"
"North' was temporarily residing, and which, situated as it is"
"overlooking the lovely glen made immortal by the name of Hawthornden,"
"in view of Roslin Chapel, and surrounded by old-fashioned walks and"
"gardens, must have been an ideal spot for a romantic couple like the"
Ferriers to roam in. Another friend writes of Wilson's later home at
"Elleray: 'In his hospitable house, where the wits of _Blackwood_"
gathered at intervals and visited individually in season and out of
"season, his daughter saw strange men of genius, such as few young"
"ladies had the fortune to see, and heard talk such as hardly another"
"has the fortune to hear. Lockhart, with his caricatures and his"
"incisive sarcasm, was an intimate of the house. The Ettrick Shepherd,"
"with his plaid and homely Doric, broke in occasionally, as did also De"
"Quincey, generally towards midnight, when he used to sit pouring forth"
"his finely-balanced, graceful sentences far on among the small hours of"
"the morning. There were students, too, year after year, many of them"
"not undistinguished, and some of whom had, we doubt not, ideas of their"
own regarding the flashing hazel eyes of their eloquent Professor's
"eldest daughter.' But her cousin was her choice, though wealth offered"
"no attraction, and neither side had reason to regret the marriage of"
affection.
"At the time of his marriage Ferrier had been practising at the Bar,"
"probably with no great measure of success, seeing that his heart was"
not really set upon his work. It was at this period that he first began
"And so, besides dethroning the Burmese king, and occupying his golden"
"palace, we are ousting from their pleasant homes the guardian spirits of"
"the trees. They flee before the cold materialism of our belief, before"
the brutality of our manners. The headman did not say this; he did not
"mean to say this, for he is a very courteous man and a great friend of"
"all of us; but that is what it came to, I think."
"The trunk of this tree is more than ten feet through--not a round bole,"
"but like the pillar in a Gothic cathedral, as of many smaller boles"
growing together; and the roots spread out into a pedestal before
entering the ground. The trunk does not go up very far. At perhaps
twenty-five feet above the ground it divides into a myriad of smaller
"trunks, not branches, till it looks more like a forest than a single"
tree; it is full of life still. Though the pigeons and the doves come
"here no longer, there are a thousand other birds flitting to and fro in"
their aerial city and chirping to each other. Two tiny squirrels have
"just run along a branch nearly over my head, in a desperate hurry"
"apparently, their tails cocked over their backs, and a sky blue"
chameleon is standing on the trunk near where it parts. There is always
"a breeze in this great tree; the leaves are always moving, and there is"
a continuous rustle and murmur up there. A mango-tree and tamarind near
by are quite still. Not a breath shakes their leaves; they are as still
"as stone, but the shadow of the fig-tree is chequered with ever-changing"
"lights. Is the Nat really gone? Perhaps not; perhaps he is still there,"
"still caring for his tree, only shy now and distrustful, and therefore"
no more seen.
"Whole woods are enchanted sometimes, and no one dare enter them. Such a"
"wood I know, far away north, near the hills, which is full of Nats."
"There was a great deal of game in it, for animals sought shelter there,"
"and no one dared to disturb them; not the villagers to cut firewood, nor"
"spacious days of Great Elizabeth, than in a tale of modern life such"
as _Two Years Ago_. His Broad Church Catholic teaching does not always
"find its way to the man in the street, and Henry Kingsley, whose life"
"was so different from that of his illustrious clerical brother, has"
more of human interest in his stories.
"The novel with a purpose, and especially with a religious purpose,"
"fails only, when it does fail, because the author’s knowledge of the"
"average man in his sins and his temptations to sin, is altogether"
incommensurate with his familiarity with the great religious and
social problems of which his story would suggest a solution.
It is often supposed that the men do not care to find the subject of
"religion introduced in fiction, that they resent religion in a novel,"
as children resent the administration of a medicinal powder in a
spoonful of jam; but the expert witness of publishers demolishes this
"opinion. After all, the religious claim is insistent, and life is"
untruly depicted when men and women are described in a story as
uninfluenced by it. There is something unreal in a book which has no
Sundays in it. Critical opinion as expressed in the notices of books
"in the daily papers, and in more weighty reviews, is very misleading,"
simply because the reviewers are generally very young men or women
who know more or less of literature but very little of life. The wrath
of the young man fresh from the University at the success of those
books which do not ignore the spiritual needs of men and women amuses
the experienced author.
“Faugh!” cries Mr. Jones of Balliol; “another batch of sin and
sentiment!” “The Christian creed and the conjugal copula! Religion and
Patchouli!” Yet the critic forgets that those who would reach the
minds and hearts of men must deal with the problems of creed and
"character which men have to solve, each one for himself."
LAST CHANCES.
At an early hour on Sunday all Kirton seemed astir. The streets were
"alive with thronging people, with banners, with inchoate and still"
"amorphous processions, with vendors of meat, drink, and newspapers."
"According to the official arrangements, the proceedings were not to"
"begin till one o'clock, and, in theory, the forenoon hours were left"
"undisturbed; but, what with the people who were taking part in the"
"demonstration, and those who were going to look on, and those who hoped"
"to suck some profit to themselves out of the day's work, the ordinary"
"duties and observances of a Sunday were largely neglected, and Mr."
"Puttock, passing on his way to chapel at the head of his family, did not"
lack material for reprobation in the temporary superseding of religious
obligations.
"The Governor and his family drove to the Cathedral, according to their"
"custom, Eleanor Scaife having pleaded in vain for leave to walk about"
"the streets instead. Lady Eynesford declined to recognise the occasion,"
and Eleanor had to content herself with stealthy glances to right and
left till the church doors engulfed her. The only absentee was Alicia
"Derosne, and she was not walking about the streets, but sitting under"
"the verandah, with a book unopened on her knees, and her eyes set in"
empty fixedness on the horizon. The luxuriant growth of a southern
"summer filled her nostrils with sweet scents, and the wind, blowing off"
"the sea, tempered the heat to a fresh and balmy warmth; the waves"
"sparkled in the sun, and the world was loud in boast of its own beauty;"
"but poor Alicia, like many a maid before, was wondering how long this"
"wretched life was to last, and how any one was ever happy. Faith bruised"
and trust misplaced blotted out for her the joy of living and the
"exultation of youth. If these things were true, why did the sun shine,"
"and how could the world be merry? If these things were true, for her the"
Osiris were either immediately identified or else were identical from the
beginning. The divinity whose worship was started at Alexandria by Ptolemy
was the god that ruled the dead and shared his immortality with them. He
"was fundamentally an Egyptian god, and the most popular of the deities of"
the Nile. Herodotus says that Isis and Osiris were revered by every
"inhabitant of the country, and their traditional holidays involved secret"
ceremonies whose sacred meaning the Greek writer dared not reveal.[2]
"Recognizing their Osiris in Serapis, the Egyptians readily accepted the new"
cult. There was a tradition that a new dynasty should introduce a new god
or give a sort of preeminence to the god of its own district. From time
immemorial politics had changed the {75} government of heaven when changing
that of earth. Under the Ptolemies the Serapis of Alexandria naturally
"became one of the principal divinities of the country, just as the Ammon of"
Thebes had been the chief of the celestial hierarchy under the Pharaohs of
"that city, or as, under the sovereigns from Sais, the local Neith had the"
primacy. At the time of the Antonines there were forty-two Serapeums in
Egypt.[3]
But the purpose of the Ptolemies was not to add one more Egyptian god to
the countless number already worshiped by their subjects. They wanted this
"god to unite in one common worship the two races inhabiting the kingdom,"
and thus to further a complete fusion. The Greeks were obliged to worship
him side by side with the natives. It was a clever political idea to
institute a Hellenized Egyptian religion at Alexandria. A tradition
"mentioned by Plutarch[4] has it that Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, a"
"man of advanced ideas, together with Timotheus, a Eumolpid from Eleusis,"
thought out the character that would best suit the newcomer. The result was
that the composite religion founded by the Lagides became a combination of
the old creed of the Pharaohs and the Greek mysteries.
"First of all, the liturgic language was no longer the native idiom but"
But what shall we say of our president--Ingersoll? A man who in
ten short years has carried mental liberty into every household in
"America--who is without limitations in religion, and modifies justice by"
"no prefix. A man who, with unequaled oratory, champions Freedom--not the"
"""free, white, adult, male"" freedom of Washington. A man who has breasted"
"a whirlwind of detraction and abuse for Justice--not the ""male, adult"""
"justice of Lincoln, but the freedom and justice, without limitation, for"
"""man, woman, and child."""
"With such a leader, what should not be achieved? With such a champion,"
what cause could fail? If the people ever place such a man in the White
"House, the nations of this earth will know, for the first time, the real"
meaning of a free government under secular administration.
"""A government of the people, for the people, by the people,"" will be"
"more than simply a high-sounding phrase, which, read by the light of the"
"past, was only a bitter mockery to a race in chains; and, read by the"
"light of the present, is a choice bit of grim humor to half of a nation"
in petticoats. But so long as the taste of the voter is such that he
prefers to place in the executive chair a type of man so eminently
fitted for private life that when you want to find him you have to
"_shake the chair_ to see if he is in it, just so long will there be no"
danger that the lightning will strike so as to deprive the Freethinkers
of one man in America who could fill the national executive chair
"_full_, and strain the back and sides a little getting in."
"Once more I send greetings to the Convention, with the hope that you may"

"would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the"
Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. He took the bit that
"hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once"
"ran up, breathing fire and flame; but he seized the moment when he came"
"running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his"
"mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no"
"trouble bringing him to the stable. Then he went to his room again, and"
began to whistle and sing. In the evening the giant came home with his
"goats. ""Did you fetch the horse?"" he asked. ""Yes, master,"" said the"
"king's son. ""It would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it"
"straight to the stable."" ""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and"
"went into the stable. But there stood the horse, just as the king's son"
"had said. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you"
"could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Yesterday the master"
"chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her"
"again. I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like"
"to see her,"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very simple and"
"stupid. ""You will get to see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant."
"On the third morning the giant went off again with his goats. ""To-day"
"you must go to the devil, and fetch me his tribute,"" said he to the"
"king's son. ""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of"
"the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know"
"it,"" and with that he went off. ""You may be a kind master,"" said the"
"king's son; ""yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of"
"it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. You claim that"
"she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to"
"do,"" and with that he went in to her. And when the Master Girl asked him"
"what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to"
"the devil and fetch a tribute. ""But how will you go about it?"" asked the"
"Master Girl. ""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for"

"stern islanders. In his charming romance, ""Colomba,"" M. Prosper"
"Mérimée has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as"
"preoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his"
"dwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for"
"attack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in"
"the streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the"
"household, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and"
"watched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in"
"silence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first"
warning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded
the word.
"In such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where"
"woman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the"
"typical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,"
"brave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for"
the glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon
was to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena
a chaotic France and a distracted Europe.
Amidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates
and lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical
"importance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the"
"oft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa."
"As became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the"
Buonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a
"document of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jérome, ""Egregius"
"Hieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium."" These distinctions"
they seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the
"Corsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as"
"in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,"
"[Sidenote: Repeal of Foreign Enlistment Act. 59 G. 3, c. 69.]"
"31. From and after the commencement of this Act, an Act passed in the"
"fifty-ninth year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Third,"
"chapter sixty-nine, intituled ""An Act to prevent the enlisting or"
"engagement of His Majesty's subjects to serve in foreign service, and"
"the fitting out or equipping, in His Majesty's dominions, vessels for"
"warlike purposes, without His Majesty's license,"" shall be repealed:"
"Provided that such repeal shall not affect any penalty, forfeiture, or"
other punishment incurred or to be incurred in respect of any offence
"committed before this Act comes into operation, nor the institution of"
"any investigation or legal proceeding, or any other remedy for enforcing"
"any such penalty, forfeiture, or punishment as aforesaid."
[Sidenote: Saving as to Commissioned Foreign Ships.]
32. Nothing in this Act contained shall subject to forfeiture any
"commissioned ship of any foreign state, or give to any British court"
over or in respect of any ship entitled to recognition as a commissioned
ship of any foreign state any jurisdiction which it would not have had
if this Act had not passed.

"the air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path, and quietly,"
"calmly, majestically, the _Arcturus_ floated upward."

"Breckenridge, sixty seconds after the initial lift, actuated the system"
of magnetic relays which would gradually cut in the precisely measured
"""starting power,"" which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine"
"minutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power,"
they would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the
few thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate
powerfully against their progress.
Faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the
"starting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers"
felt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the
"acceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained"
constant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a
few moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps
a few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse
"than riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no"
change from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in
express elevators.
"The computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with"
"interest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space,"
there was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy
and precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could
be done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and
who was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest
degree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands
were the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed
shipwrecked crew casting lots for the next occupant of the kettle could
suffer no greater pangs of apprehension than did the Sisters of Saint
Martha on the imminence of an appointment to the orphanage. They had
taken vows of obedience. The Mother Superior's selection was final.
The unfortunate nominee had to pack up her slender belongings and go
"to Willesden. Being a faulty human being (and none but a faulty,"
"unpractical, unsympathetic human being can want, in these days of"
"enlightenment, to shut herself up in a nunnery for the rest of her life,"
with the avowed intention of never doing a hand's turn for any one of
"God's creatures until the day of her death), she invariably regarded"
herself as a holy martyr and ruled the poor little devils of orphans for
"the greater glory of God (magnified entirely, be it understood, by her"
own martyrdom) than for the greater happiness of the poor little devils.
Sister Theophila--in entering into religion the Protestant Sisters
"changed the names by which they were known in the world, according to"
"the time-honoured tradition of an alien church--Sister Theophila, with"
"the temperament of the recluse, had been thrust into this position"
of responsibility against her will. She performed her duties with
scrupulous exactitude and pious resignation. Her ideal of life was the
"ascetic, and to this ideal the twenty orphans had to conform. She did"
not love the orphans.
"Her staff consisted of one matron, a married woman of a much humbler"
class than her own. Possibly she might have loved the orphans had
"she not seen such a succession of them, and her own work been less"
harassing. Twenty female London orphans from disreputable homes are
a tough handful. When you insist on their conformity with the ascetic
"ideal, they become tougher. They will not allow themselves to be loved."
"“And ungrateful!” exclaimed the matron, one day when she was taking"
Risca round the institution. He had expressed to Sister Theophila his
resurrection of Jesus Christ can be set aside as a “cunningly devised
"fable.” No scientific man, who has not deliberately shut himself in an"
hermetically sealed materialism would say to-day that “Miracles” do
not happen. It is a question of evidence.
"And educated men know that there is a science of metaphysics, that"
"there is a science of psychology, that literary criticism is"
"scientific, that the age of a document can be decided, that cumulative"
"evidence cannot be ignored, and that simply to put aside the claims of"
Christianity without examination is absurd.
"But, as Sir Leslie Stephen shows, it is the Christianity of the"
"Catholic creed that matters, and it is this Christianity of which the"
man in the street has need. It gives him a solution of those social
"and ethical problems which he must solve, which he can only neglect at"
"the peril of natural degradation. For example, the position of women"
depends upon our belief or disbelief that Christ was born of the
Virgin Mary. To say that monogamy is the natural evolution of
"humanity, that chastity in the young unmarried man is a product of"
"civilization, that a high conception of a man’s duty to posterity will"
"keep him from harlotry, is simply to show ignorance of history, of"
"human nature, and of the world as it is. A man who talks now-a-days"
about the respect of marriage being a Teutonic contribution to the
"evolution of civilized society, is behind the times. We _know_ that"
"respect for women, and marriage held in honour, are the creations of"
"the Holy Catholic Church, which insists on the Incarnation of the Lord"
Jesus Christ.
But the man in the street does not know these things. The discoveries
"in science, whether physical or psychical, do not reach him. Technical"
treatises are too strong meat for his intellectual digestion. The
pulpit does not appeal to him. At every baptism in the Church of
"less our own, sometimes rest upon a merest chance--dropped in for supper"
at a fashionable place patronized by those who wish to see the brightest
"of Havana life. There were other places, of course, that might have"
"offered quite as much, but this one happened to be on the route we had"
taken.
"Midnight passed, but still we lingered, seated on the latticed balcony"
that encircles an inner court where cabaret features are
"held--suggestive of a bull ring. One rather piquant Spanish girl,"
"playing her accompaniment on a guitar, gazed softly up at Tommy while"
"singing about some wonderful Nirvana, an enchanted island that floated"
"in a sea of love. It was a pretty song, even if more intense than"
"temperate, and pleased with it he tossed her a coin; whereupon she"
"tilted her chin and raised a shoulder, asking in the universal language"
of cabarets if she should not come up and drink a health with the
"_imperioso Señor_. But he, whose heart was beating against a twenty-page"
"letter from a nymph in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, laughed a"
"negative, this time throwing her a flower that she kissed lightly and"
put in her hair.
"We had supped well, the mandolins were now tinkling, incessantly, and"
"this, mingled with the silvery tones of glasses touched in eager"
"pledges, created an ensemble of sounds dear to the heart of every true"
Bohemian. Effects were good here. The ceilings and walls of our balcony
were lighted by vari-colored electric bulbs artfully placed amidst
"growing vines that drooped in festoons above the tables, producing a"
"fairy-like enchantment. And, indeed, the café proved to be a mart not"
"only of enchantments but entertainments, including a popular gambling"
salon.
"At last, in desperation seeing that Monsieur refused to be cheered,"
"Tommy sprang up, saying:"
entertains the company for hours.”
"In modern times, the nurse, who is now receiving such complete"
"training for her duties with the children, should be ready to"
imitate the “dreamer” of the Indian tribe. I rejoice to find that
regular instruction in Story-telling is being given in many of the
institutions where the nurses are trained.
Some years ago there appeared a book by Dion Calthrop called “King
"Peter,” which illustrates very fully the effect of story-telling. It"
is the account of the education of a young prince which is carried on
"at first by means of stories, and later he is taken out into the arena"
of Life to be shown what is happening there--the dramatic appeal being
always the means used to awaken his imagination. The fact that only
_one_ story a year is told him prevents our seeing the effect from day
"to day, but the time matters little. We only need faith to believe that"
"the growth, though slow, was very sure."
"There is something of the same idea in the “Adventures of Telemachus,”"
"written by Fénélon for his royal pupil, the young Duke of Burgundy; but"
whereas Calthrop trusts to the results of indirect teaching by means of
"dramatic stories, Fénélon, on the contrary, makes use of the somewhat"
"heavy, didactic method, so that one would think the attention of the"
young prince must have wandered at times; and I imagine Telemachus was
"in the same condition when he was addressed at some length by Mentor,"
"who, being Minerva (though in disguise), should occasionally have"
displayed that sense of humour which must always temper true wisdom:
"Take, for instance, the heavy reproof conveyed in the following"
passage:
“Death and shipwreck are less dreadful than the pleasures that attack
starting therefore a few days ahead of the Dobuan uvalaku fleet. I
"rowed over in a dinghy to the big village, and watched the loading and"
"departing of the canoes. There was a bustle in the village, and even a"
few old women could be seen helping the men in their tasks. The large
"canoes were being pushed into the water from their supports, on which"
they were beached. They had been already prepared for the journey
"there, their platforms covered with plaited palm leaves, frames put"
"in their bottoms to support the cargo, boards placed crossways within"
"the canoe to serve as seats for the crew, the mast, rigging and sail"
"laid handy. The loading, however, begins only after the canoe is in"
"water. The large, trough-shaped chunks of sago were put at the bottom,"
"while men and women carefully brought out the big clay pots, stowing"
them away with many precautions in special places in the middle
"(see Plate XLVII). Then, one after the other, the canoes went off,"
paddling round the southern end of the island towards the West. At
"about ten o'clock in the morning, the last canoe disappeared round the"
"promontory, and the village remained practically empty. There was no"
"saying of farewells, not a trace of any emotion on the part of those"
"leaving or those remaining. But it must be remembered that, owing to"
"my presence, no women except one or two old hags, were visible on the"
"shore. All my best informants gone, I intended to move to Nabwageta"
"next morning. At sunset, I made a long excursion in my dinghy round"
"the western shores of Gumasila, and it was on that occasion that I"
discovered all those who had left that morning on the Kula sitting on
"Giyasila beach, in accordance with the Kula custom of a preliminary"
"halt, such as the one on Muwa described in Chapter VII."
"Next morning, I left for the neighbouring island and village of"
"Nabwageta, and only after he saw me safely off, Tovasana and his party"
"left in his canoe, following the others to Vakuta. In Nabwageta, the"
whole community were in the midst of their final preparations for
"departure, for they intended to wait for the Dobuans and sail with"
of their original structure and mineral composition remains to
tell whether the rocks from which they were derived were
"sedimentary or igneous, or to what variety of either of these"
classes they belonged.
"In many cases, however, the early history of a metamorphic rock"
can be deciphered. Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it
"originally water-laid. Schists may contain rolled-out pebbles,"
showing their derivation from a conglomerate. Dikes of igneous
rocks may be followed into a region where they have been foliated
by pressure. The most thoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes
"be traced out into unaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks, or"
among them may be found patches of little change where their
history maybe read.
Metamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological
"ages, and most rare among rocks of recent formation. No doubt it"
is now in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded
by heat either from intrusive igneous masses or from the earth's
"interior, or are suffering slow deformation under the thrust of"
mountain-making forces.
Suggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be
exposed to view. Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface
to-day?
MINERAL VEINS
In regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently
found to be filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited
"from solution by underground water, and fissures thus filled are"
known as mineral veins. Much of the importance of mineral veins is
"the very primitive age of the individual, just as they belong to the"
"primitive age of the race, but experience in telling stories has taught"
me to compromise.
"Some people maintain that little children, who take things with brutal"
"logic, ought not to be allowed the Fairy Tale in its more limited"
"form of the Supernatural; whereas, if presented to older children,"
"this material can be criticised, catalogued and (alas!) rejected as"
"worthless, or retained with flippant toleration."
"Now, whilst recognising a certain value in this point of view, I am"
"bound to admit that if we regulate our stories entirely on this basis,"
we lose the real value of the Fairy Tale element--it is the one element
"which causes little children to _wonder_, simply because no scientific"
analysis of the story can be presented to them. It is somewhat
heartrending to feel that Jack and the Bean-Stalk and stories of that
ilk are to be handed over to the critical youth who will condemn the
"quick growth of the tree as being contrary to the order of nature, and"
wonder why Jack was not playing football in the school team instead of
climbing trees in search of imaginary adventures.
A wonderful plea for the telling of early superstitions to children is
to be found in an old Indian Allegory called “The Blazing Mansion.”
"“An old man owned a large, rambling mansion--the pillars"
"were rotten, the galleries tumbling down, the thatch dry and"
"combustible, and there was only one door. Suddenly, one day, there"
was a smell of fire: the old man rushed out. To his horror he
"saw that the thatch was aflame, the rotten pillars were catching"
"fire one by one, and the rafters were burning like tinder. But"
"inside, the children went on amusing themselves quite happily. The"
distracted father said: ‘I will run in and save my children. I will
"probably falls into the fallacy, common even among those who follow"
"the sea, that a partial or entire clearance of her ""crowd"" will quite"
"alter her nature; whereas sailors being sailors--that is, people of"
certain fairly definite attributes--any given environment makes them
much the same as those who preceded them.
But entire changes in the _personnel_ of a vessel rarely take place.
"The officers change, but the crew remains: the crew goes, but"
officers stay.  Or more frequently some few men are favourites of one
"or two of the officers, and they mingle with the new crew like yeast,"
till the ancient fermentation is visible once more.
Ships (to speak thus of their companies) talk of the same subjects
over a million miles of changing seas: they have a permanent stock of
subjects.  These include all which are perennially of interest to
"seafaring men, such as homes _versus_ boarding-houses, but they"
"include also something more individual, something more intimately"
connected with the essence of that particular vessel.  And the one
unending topic of interest on board the _Potluck_ was foreign
politics.
"How this came about no one knew, though many theories were set afloat"
and sunk again every Sunday afternoon.  Some said that the first
"captain of the _Potluck_ was called Palmerstone, and that he"
introduced the subject of England _versus_ the world as soon as he
came on board.  Others swore that they had been told by a clerk in
the employ of the firm that there had been a discussion over her very
keel concerning the introduction into her frame of foreign oaks.
"""This was the way of it,"" said Jack Hart, who was the chief upholder"
"of this particular theory, and the son of a little shipbuilder--""the"
lot that built her at Liverpool was the mixedest crowd of forsaken
Half-a-dozen problems of extreme national importance confront every
thinking English man and woman in 1907. The air is thick with their
"stir and movement, and so great is the noise and reverberation of them"
that true “royalty” of “_inward_ happiness” seems a thing impossible
"and past by in these troubled times. Be that as it may, it is quite"
certain that one of the most real and pressing of these problems is
that summed up in the stock phrase “Record Low Birth-rate.”
We hear a great deal about the doings of a class of people who are
"referred to as “The Smart Set,” and it is actually said that its"
influence is having a serious effect upon the national character. I do
not believe it for a moment. It seems a folly to suppose that a
handful of champagne corks floating on a cess-pool has any
far-reaching influence upon the English home. I mention that small
"section of society constituted by the idle and luxurious rich,"
"because, whatever their vices are, they are being used as whipping-boy"
for enormous numbers of people whose lives are equally guilty with
theirs in at least one regard--in the matter of which I am writing
now.
I propose in this essay to discuss the question of the decline in the
birth-rate from the Christian and Catholic standpoint. There is only
"one perfect philosophy, and all other half-true philosophies in the"
"light of which we might consider such a momentous matter as this, lead"
only to the conclusion that expediency is the highest good. Without
the incentive of the Christian Faith and without the light of the
Incarnation one may sit in a corner and think till “all’s blue in
cloud cuckoo land.” Christianity can alone be reconciled with
"Economics, theory and practice celebrating always the marriage of the"
"King’s son, the wedding of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual and the"
material. Plato knew that it was impossible to raise the Greek state
"to the level of his philosophic principles, and Aristotle frankly"
"attacks upon capital, and encouraged to believe that it is the priest"
who is his true foe. “_Le cléricalisme voilà l’ennemi_” is a
convenient cry. A vague Deism is not dangerous to wealthy
manufacturers; but if the clergy are going to take up Christian
Socialism it is time to be up and doing. So every weapon against the
"creed of Christendom is being taken down and examined, and many an old"
fallacy is refurbished and employed once more. Celsus is disinterred
"from the tomb in which Origen had buried him, and his filthy slander"
of the Blessed Virgin is printed as though it were a new discovery of
historical research. Collins is called into court again as though
"Bentley had never exposed his ignorance, and Hume’s _a priori_ method"
is revived as though it had never been discredited; whilst Strauss and
"Renan are quoted as authorities, as if Westcott and Lightfoot had"
never been known. Shunt the working classes on a new line of rails.
"Set them shrieking against sacramentalists, and swearing at"
"sacerdotalists, and we may quietly arrange our commercial combinations"
and protect our manufacturing interests!
I want to see the seats under the dome of St. Paul’s filled not by
"only the middle-aged middle classes, who for the most part are"
"Christian in creed, but by the young artisans and craftsmen, and the"
"strong politicians who fill the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, and"
crowd the great Assembly Rooms of Birmingham and Liverpool when an
election is drawing near. The timid members of the Episcopate who may
be reminded that “He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he
"that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,” are not our only Bishops."
Occasionally a Prime Minister offers for election and consecration a
man who can reach the minds and consciences of men. Is it too great an
ambition for a storyteller to try to arouse in people’s minds a
"suspicion that after all something may be said for the Catholic Faith,"
and so to bring them to listen to those who know and can teach it?
Each man must do his work with such tools as have come in his way. The
highly-developed imagination of the one and the stodgy prosaical
temperament of the other. Tom could enter into the elementary question
"of giving his school-fellow a black eye, but could not possibly enter"
into the drama of the imaginary arrival of a lion. He was sorely in
need of Fairy Stories.
"It is for this element we have to cater, and we cannot shirk our"
responsibilities.
"William James says: “Living things, moving things or things that"
"savour of danger or blood, that have a dramatic quality, these are"
"the things natively interesting to childhood, to the exclusion of"
"almost everything else, and the teacher of young children (until more"
artificial interests have grown up) will keep in touch with his pupils
by constant appeal to such matters as those.”[34]
Of course the savour of danger and blood is only _one_ of the things to
"which we should appeal, but I give the whole passage to make the point"
clearer.
"This is one of the most difficult parts of our selection, namely, how"
to present enough excitement for the child and yet include enough
constructive element which will satisfy him when the thirst for
“blugginess” is slaked.
"And here I should like to say that, whilst wishing to encourage in"
children great admiration and reverence for the courage and other fine
"qualities which have been displayed in times of war, and which have"
"mitigated its horrors, I think we should show that some of the finest"
moments in these heroes' lives had nothing to do with their profession
as soldiers. Thus we have the well-known story of Sir Philip Sidney and
the soldier; the wonderful scene where Roland drags the bodies of his
the religious orders. To these were joined the northern parts of Navarra
"and the Basque countries whose privileges had been threatened, together"
with large districts of the ever-turbulent provinces of Aragon and
Catalunia.
Round the Queen-Regent and her little daughter collected all the liberal
"opinion of the peninsula, most of the foreign sympathy, the influence of"
"the great towns and sea-ports, of the capital and the government"
"officials, the regular army and police with their officers--indeed all"
the organised and stated machinery of government.
But up to the time of our history these advantages had been to some
extent neutralised by the ill-success of the governmental generalship
and by the brilliant successes of two great Carlist leaders--Tomas
Zumalacarregui and Ramon Cabrera.
These men perfectly understood the conditions of warfare among their
"native mountains, and had inflicted defeat upon defeat on every Cristino"
general sent against them.
But a cloud had of late overspread the fair prospects of the party.
"Their great general, Tomas Zumalacarregui, had been killed by a cannon"
"ball at the siege of Bilbao, and Cabrera, though unsurpassed as a"
"guerrilla leader, had not the swift Napoleonic judgment and breadth of"
"view of his predecessor. Add to this that a new premier, Mendizábal, and"
"a new general, Espartero, were directing operations from Madrid. The"
"former, already half English, had begun to carry out his great scheme of"
filling the pockets of the civil and military authorities by conveying
to the government all the property belonging to the religious orders
"throughout Spain, who, like our friend the Abbot of Montblanch, had"
resolutely and universally espoused the cause of Don Carlos.
"went on to explain that Mr. Justice Gaunt, by nature a somewhat"
"cross-grained old limb of the law, had been very ill-pleased over being"
"bothered again, and at a moment when most of his colleagues were"
"enjoying a holiday, about any such apparently endless case as that of"
"the Jura succession, which had been cropping up before him, at more or"
"less lengthy intervals, for quite a number of years, and concerning"
"which he had, only a few days before, made an order of court in favour"
of Justin Carthew.
Captain Dove clapped his soft felt hat on his head with a very
devil-may-care expression.
"""Come on, then,"" said he grimly, and Mr. Jobling was not slow to lead"
the way. So that they reached Mr. Justice Gaunt's chambers punctually at
"the hour appointed, and were ushered into his lordship's presence by Mr."
"Spettigrew, the learned counsel retained by Mr. Jobling on Sallie's"
"behalf, a long, lifeless-looking gentleman in a wig and gown and"
spectacles. And his lordship smiled very pleasantly as Sallie raised her
heavy veil at counsel's crafty request.
"""Pray be seated, my dear young lady,"" his lordship begged with fatherly,"
"old-fashioned kindness, and indicated a chair meant for counsel, much"
nearer his own than the rest. Nor did he often take his eyes from her
face throughout the course of a long and convincing dissertation by Mr.
"Spettigrew, on her past history, present position in life, and claims on"
"the future, with some reference to the rival claims of Mr. Justin"
Carthew.
"""And I have full proof to place before you, at once, if you wish it,"
"m'lud,"" concluded Mr. Spettigrew in his most professional drone, ""in"
support of the fact that the lady before you is the lawful daughter of
"the late earl and the countess, his second wife, who died in the desert."
My fears were justified.
"At first the conversation was commonplace, and I related various"
experiences in a desultory fashion. Those that were mildly amusing were
most appreciated. But gradually we drifted towards more vital issues and
then the long and futile argument began. The weapons of sarcasm and
denunciation were denied to me by the laws of politeness and etiquette.
I beat in vain against the solid walls of obstinate prejudice and
superficiality. His statements were uttered with dogmatic emphasis. They
expressed beliefs held with all the self-assurance born of ignorance.
"They were based on no independent reasoning or observation, but had been"
assimilated either directly from the daily Press or from a circle of
acquaintances whose entire political outlook was the creation of the
Press. It was only then that I realized the immense power of newspapers.
"For most people ""thinking"" is just the discovery of convenient phrases"
"or labels, such as ""pessimist,"" or ""socialist,"" or ""pacifist"" or"
"""Bolshevik."" When any puzzling mental attitude comes before their"
"notice, they pin one of their labels to it, and, having labelled it,"
they think they understand it. The Press supplies them with these
"labels, and, consciously or unconsciously, they store them up in their"
minds and always have a few ready for immediate use.
So familiar and commonplace were the phrases which my opponent selected
"from his store in order to reply to my every utterance, that I could"
"almost tell what he was going to say before he said it. Moreover, the"
"fact that he had travelled abroad and had associated with foreigners,"
instead of widening his view had only narrowed it. Had he never
travelled he might have been sufficiently modest to admit that he knew
nothing of foreign countries and he might have suspended judgment about
them; but the mere fact that he had travelled filled him with a deep
stimulates the heart and increases the functional activity of all
"organs, especially the kidneys and skin."
"Large or too long continued doses derange the appetite and digestion,"
congest or inflame the stomach and liver. Eight ounces of alcohol killed
a horse. Alcohol is poisonous and should be used with caution.
"USES.--Are numerous, used principally as a stimulant, either in one"
"large dose, 2 to 3 ounces of alcohol, or better, in small repeated"
"doses, 1 ounce every 1, 2 or 3 hours, can be conjoined with other"
"stimulants such as sulphuric ether, aromatic spirits of ammonia,"
"digitalis, etc."
"It is used in anesthetic mixtures, such as alcohol, ether and"
"chloroform, combined in different proportions; in snake bites it is"
administered in very large doses.
"In blood poisoning alcohol is a most potent drug, sustaining the heart,"
lowering the temperature and acting as a germicide. Alcohol makes an
"excellent dressing for wounds; applied locally to threatened bed-sores,"
frequently prevents their formation. It is useful in colds at their
"outset, or in a chill to restore the balance of the circulation and"
prevent or overcome internal congestion by relaxing the blood vessels of
the periphery.
"All alcoholic liquors are useful in debilitating diseases, such as"
"influenza, in two or three ounce doses repeated every three or four"
"hours. One-half to one drachm of quinine to one ounce of alcohol, for"
"influenza or febrile diseases in general, excepting brain and spinal"
disease; useful in convalescence. In colic alcohol can be used with a
great degree of success; it will act as a carminative antispasmodic and
"stimulant, used in collapse and weak heart; in septicaemia and pyaemia"
"easy life, but one of unending struggle. It is for him to cast his life"
"as an offering, regarding gain and loss, success and failure, as one."
Yet in my case this long persisting gloom was suddenly lifted. My
"scientific deputation in 1914, from the Government of India, gave the"
opportunity of giving demonstrations of my discoveries before the
leading scientific societies of the world. This led to the acceptance of
"my theories and results, and the recognition of the importance of the"
Indian contribution to the advancement of the world's science. My own
"experience told me how heavy, sometimes even crushing, are the"
difficulties which confront an inquirer here in India; yet it made me
"stronger in my determination, that I shall make the path of those who"
"are to follow me less arduous, and that India, is never to relinquish"
what has been won for her after years of struggle.
THE TWO IDEALS
What is it that India is to win and maintain? Can anything small or
circumscribed ever satisfy the mind of India? Has her own history and
the teaching of the past prepared her for some temporary and quite
subordinate gain? There are at this moment two complementary and not
antagonistic ideals before the country. India is drawn into the vortex
of international competition. She has to become efficient in every
"way,--through spread of education, through performance of civic duties"
"and responsibilities, through activities both industrial and commercial."
Neglect of these essentials of national duty will imperil her very
existence; and sufficient stimulus for these will be found in success
and satisfaction of personal ambition.
But these alone do not ensure the life of a nation. Such material
"activities have brought in the West their fruit, in accession of power"
"and wealth. There has been a feverish rush even in the realm of science,"
"Chiriqui, light of color, believing that the Great Spirit lived in the"
"volcano of Chiriqui, and occasionally showing their displeasure with him"
"by shooting arrows at the mountain. The Guaymies, of whom perhaps 6000"
"are left, are the tribe that buried with their dead the curious golden"
"images that were once plentiful in the bazaars of Panama, but are now"
hard to find. They have a pleasant practice of putting a calabash of
water and some plantains by a man they think dying and leaving him to
"his fate, usually in some lonesome part of the jungle. The Cunas or"
"Caribs are the tribes inhabiting the Darien. All were, and some are,"
believed still to be cannibals. Eleven lesser tribes are grouped under
this general name. As a rule they are small and muscular. Most of them
"have abandoned their ancient gaudy dress, and so far as they are clothed"
at all wear ordinary cotton clothing. Painting the face and body is
still practiced. The dead often are swung in hammocks from trees and
supplied with fresh provisions until the cords rot and the body falls to
the ground. Then the spirit’s journey to the promised land is held to be
ended and provisions are no longer needed. Sorcery and soothsaying are
"much in vogue, and the sorcerers who correspond to the medicine men of"
our North American Indians will sometimes shut themselves up in a small
"hut shrieking, beating tom-toms and imitating the cries of wild animals."
When they emerge in a sort of self-hypnotized state they are held to be
peculiarly fit for prophesying.
[Illustration: NATIVE VILLAGE AT CAPERA]
"All the Indians drink heavily, and the white man’s rum is to some extent"
"displacing the native drink of chica. This is manufactured by the women,"
"usually the old ones, who sit in a circle chewing yam roots or cassava"
and expectorating the saliva into a large bowl in the center. This
ferments and is made the basis of a highly intoxicating drink. Curiously
enough the same drink is similarly made in far-away Samoa. The dutiful
wives after thus manufacturing the material upon which their spouses get
"badly, but there were plenty of leaves left on it. I stared at it,"
"trying hard to keep awake. But soon the trunk began to quiver, then it"
wobbled with a wavy motion like a snake. Then the leafy part seemed to
"shoot out in all directions until there was nothing but a green blur,"
and I fell back against the trench wall and my rifle clattered down. I
"pulled myself together, absolutely mad with fear, because I kept on"
thinking of the last time I went on guard and the court martial and the
death sentence. I ground my teeth and stared at the tree again. But the
trunk began to wobble with snaky undulations and the green blur grew
"bigger and bigger in sudden jerks, while I tried frantically and"
desperately to keep it small. But it got the better of me and all at
once it obscured everything with a rush and I dropped forward and
knocked my forehead against the steel plate. I pulled myself together
and prayed for a Blighty or something that would get me out of this
"misery. I looked at my watch--O God, only five minutes had gone,"
one-twelfth of my time! I had a kind of panic then and I dashed my head
wildly against the trench wall and I bit my lips--I almost enjoyed the
"pain. I looked through the hole. The tree was steady at first, but it"
"soon began to wobble again. Then I said to myself: 'I don't care, I'll"
"risk it, I won't look out, I'll just keep awake. I don't suppose any"
Fritzes will come along--I'll just peep through the holes from time to
time so as to make sure.' I stamped on the duckboard and kicked the
sides of the trench and jerked my rifle up and down just to keep myself
awake. It was all right at first and I was beginning to think I would
"get over it somehow, but my feet soon felt as heavy as lead and my head"
began to swim until I fell forward once again. Jesus Christ--I didn't
"know what to do. I thought of looking at my watch, but I hadn't the"
"courage at first. Besides, I felt the seconds would slip by while I was"
hesitating and so I'd gain at least a little time. I counted the
"seconds--one, two, three ... four ... five ... six ... my head dropped"
forward and I nearly fell over. I looked at my watch--fourteen minutes
"had gone, nearly a quarter of an hour! That wasn't so bad. I felt a"
right nor to the left. The constancy of his demeanour had its effect
upon the unseen enemy. The Sergeant was not further molested; and though
it was obvious that he advanced each step in about as great danger of
"death as a man who is marched manacled to the garrote, he might simply"
"have been going to his evening billet in some quiet Castilian village,"
for all the difference it made in his appearance.
"Up to this point Cardono had walked directly up the torrent bed, the"
rounded and water-worn stones rattling and slipping under his iron-shod
"half-boots, but at a certain point where was another rough cairn of"
"stones, he suddenly diverged to the right, and mounted straight up the"
fell over the scented thyme and dwarf juniper of the mountain slopes.
Whatever of uncertainty as to his fate the Sergeant felt was rigidly
"concealed, and even when a dozen men dropped suddenly upon him from"
"various rocky hiding-places, he only shook them off with a quick gesture"
"of contempt, and said something in a loud voice which brought them all"
to a halt as if turned to stone by an enchanter's spell.
"The men paused and looked at each other. They were all well armed, and"
every man had an open knife in his hand. They had been momentarily
"checked by the words of the Sergeant, but now they came on again as"
threateningly as before. Their dark long hair was encircled by red
"handkerchiefs knotted about their brows, and in general they possessed"
teeth extraordinarily white gleaming from the duskiest of skins. The
beady sloe-black eyes of the Sergeant were repeated in almost every
"face, as well as that indefinable something which in all lands marks the"
gipsy race.
The Sergeant spoke again in a language apparently more intelligible than
the deep Romany password with which he had first checked their deadly
intentions.
and a wedge of clearance showed. Almost imperceptibly she drew back and
rubbed against the timbers. A fender began to squeeze and complain. The
dock planking creaked. Sixty seconds more and she would be out of
"arm's-reach, and still George made no haste. Again Boyd shouted at him,"
and then with one farewell glower over his shoulder the big fellow
"mounted a pile, stretched his arms upward to the bulwarks, and swung"
himself lightly aboard.
"Even yet Emerson's anxiety was of the keenest; for, notwithstanding the"
"stress of these dragging moments, he had not forgotten Fraser, the"
"vagabond, the morally twisted rascal, to whose courage and"
resourcefulness he owed so much. He strained his eyes for a glimpse of
"the fellow, at the same time dreading the sight of a uniform. Would the"
ship never get under way and out of hailing distance? If those officers
"had discovered their mistake, they might yet have time to stop him. He"
"vowed desperately that he would not let them, not if he had to take"
_The Bedford Castle_ to sea with a gun at the back of her helmsman. He
"made his way hurriedly to the bridge, where he hastily explained to"
"Captain Peasley his evasion of the officers; and here he found Cherry,"
"her face flushed, her eyes sparkling with excitement, but far too wise"
to speak to him in his present state of mind.
A scattered shower of missiles came aboard as the strikers kept pace
"with the steamer to the end of the slip, exciting the fishermen, who"
"had again mounted the rigging, to a simian frenzy. Oaths, insults, and"
jeers were hurled back and forth; but as the big steamer gathered
"momentum and slid out of her berth, they grew gradually more"
"indistinct, until at last they became muffled, broken, and meaningless."
"Even then the rival ranks continued to volley profanely at each other,"
"while the Captain, with hand on the whistle-rope, blew taunting blasts;"
nor did the fishermen descend from their perches until the forms on the
"dock had blurred together and the city lay massed in the distance, tier"
"tenable positions. In one type of dream, we imagine we easily achieve all"
"sorts of difficult and complicated actions, but in reality we make no"
movement; the ease and rapidity with which the mental machine moves is due
"to the fact that it is ungeared, and is effecting no work at all. In the"
other type of dream we make violent but inadequate efforts at movement
"and only partially succeed; the machine is partially geared, in a state"
intermediate between deep sleep and the waking condition.]

"[Footnote 84: The systematic megalomania of insanity can, however, have"
"its rise in dreams; Régis and Lalanne (_International Medical Congress_,"
"1900; _Proceedings, Section de Psychiatrie_, p. 227) met within a short"
period with four cases in which this had taken place.]
"[Footnote 85: This indeed seems to have been recognised by Wundt, who"
regards a 'functional rest of the sensory centres and of the apperception
"centre,' resulting in heightened latent energy which lends unusual"
"strength to excitations, as a secondary condition of the dream state."
"Külpe (_Outline of Psychology_, p. 212) argues that the existence of"
vivid dreams shows that fatigue with its diminished associability fails
to affect the central sensations themselves; this increased excitability
"resulting from dissociation may itself, however, be regarded as a symptom"
of fatigue; hyperaesthesia and anaesthesia are alike signs of exhaustion.]
[Footnote 86: The exhaustion sometimes felt on awaking from a dream
perhaps testifies to its emotional potency. Delboeuf states that a friend
of his experienced a dream so terrible in its emotional strain that on
awaking his black hair was found to have turned completely white.]

more or less clearly recognised by various investigators. Thus C. L.
"In the twelve preceding chapters, we have followed an expedition"
from Sinaketa to Dobu. But branching off at almost every step from
"its straight track, we studied the various associated institutions"
"and underlying beliefs; we quoted magical formulæ, and told"
"mythical stories, and thus we broke up the continuous thread of the"
"narrative. In this chapter, as we are already acquainted with the"
"customs, beliefs and institutions implied in the Kula, we are ready"
to follow a straight and consecutive tale of an expedition in the
"inverse direction, from Dobu to Sinaketa."
"As I have seen, indeed followed, a big uvalaku expedition from"
"the South to the Trobriands, I shall be able to give some of the"
"scenes from direct impression, and not from reconstruction. Such"
a reconstruction for one who has seen much of the natives' tribal
life and has a good grip over intelligent informants is neither very
"difficult nor need it be fanciful at all. Indeed, towards the end"
"of my second visit, I had several times opportunities to check such"
"a reconstruction by witnessing the actual occurrence, for after my"
first year's stay in the Trobriands I had written out already some
"of my material. As a rule, even in minute details, my reconstructions"
"hardly differed from reality, as the tests have shown. None the less,"
it is possible for an Ethnographer to enter into concrete details
with more conviction when he describes things actually seen.
"In September, 1917, an uvalaku expedition was led by Kouta'uya"
"from Sinaketa to Dobu. The Vakutans joining them on the way, and the"
"canoes of the Amphletts following them also, some forty canoes finally"
arrived at the western shore of Dawson Straits. It was arranged then
and there that a return expedition from that district should visit
"Sinaketa in about six months' time. Kauyaporu, the esa'esa (headman)"
"of Kesora'i hamlet in the village of Bwayowa, had a pig with circular"
"fell with terrific force upon the dome of the lantern, splintering the"
"roof and smashing the light, so that no welcome rays could be thrown"
from the tower again that night. The keepers at once set to work with
"the fog-signal, and during the hours of darkness worked like slaves,"
blaring out a warning by sound which they were unable to give visually.
"Fortunately, such an experience as befell the keepers of the American"
Thimble Shoal light is very rare. This beacon marks the shoal of that
"name, and is, or rather was, a screw-pile iron lighthouse, marking 11"
"feet of water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. On"
"December 27, 1909, the keepers were immersed in their tasks, when there"
was a terrible crash followed by a dismal rending and splitting. The
building shivered from top to bottom. The keepers were thrown off their
"feet, and when they regained their wits they found that the schooner"
"_Malcolm Baxter Junior_, while being towed by a tug, had blundered into"
"them, and had carried a considerable portion of the building away. The"
"impact upset the light; the scattered oil burst into flame, and within"
a few minutes the lighthouse was blazing like a gigantic bonfire. The
"keepers stuck to their posts, and endeavoured frantically to extinguish"
"the outbreak, but their efforts were too puny to make any impression."
"At last, when a foothold was no longer possible with safety, and under"
"extreme pressure, they abandoned their charge. When the flames had"
completed their destructive work the lighthouse presented a sorry
"sight, being a mass of broken and twisted ironwork. A wooden tower was"
"erected with all despatch, and a fog-signal was installed, so that the"
men could carry on their duties while the reconstruction of the station
was hurried forward.
"The keepers turn their hands to strange occupations. Fretwork,"
"wood-carving, poker-work, and similar hobbies, are practised freely."
A few devote their leisure to intellectual improvement to fit them
"for other walks in life. The keeper of Windward Point, Guantanamo"
Indeed the hour for the contest had well-nigh come.  Grey could see that
"the other horses were assembling, their riders decked in every colour of"
"the rainbow, quite eclipsing the quiet and workmanlike suit of buff"
which he wore.  But Grey’s taste had always disinclined him to gaudy
"colours.  The soft leather, finely chased and stamped in gold, pleased"
his eye more than rich-hued cloths or velvets.  His breeches were of
"white buckskin cut by Lord Sandford’s own tailor, and he wore long boots"
"fitted with silver spurs, albeit he scarcely ever had need of the latter"
when he bestrode Don Carlos.  His scarf was of white silk fringed with
"gold, and his only adornment was a cravat of fine lace, fastened with a"
"diamond clasp.  His cocked hat matched his buff coat, and was adorned"
"with a white plume.  Altogether, as he rode forward to his place, it"
would have been hard to find a fault with his dress or person; and the
"ladies behind their fans audibly praised his elegant figure, graceful"
"seat, and distinguished and handsome face."
"Grey, all unconscious of the favour bestowed upon him, rode up and"
saluted courteously the gentlemen who were to meet him and each other in
"rivalry. Lord Sandford, splendidly mounted, was to act as judge at the"
winning post.  Another of his friends was to be starter; and gentlemen
were posted at various points along the course to see that all the rules
"laid down were observed, and that no rider deviated from the"
well-pegged-out route prescribed for all.  The spectators scattered
"hither and thither, taking up stations wherever their fancy prompted."
The course seemed marked out by a glittering border extending down both
"sides.  The sun shone brilliantly in the sky, and all nature seemed in"
gladsome mood.
Grey cast a keen look at the seven rival steeds as they were brought
into line for the start.  He picked out in a moment the two of whom
"Dicon had spoken, and saw that he had judged well.  Then he gave his"
"whole mind to the task in hand, checked with hand and voice the prancing"
So after the small and imperious royal maid had been carried screaming
"and battling upstairs by Doña Susana and the globular major-domo, La"
"Giralda, richly rewarded in golden coin of the realm, and with all the"
"requisite information as to the palace, betook herself back to the gate"
"by which she had left the ass. This she loaded again, and driving it"
"before her she retraced her steps past the corner of the palace, and so"
to the porter's lodge by the great gate.
Here she was presently ushered out by a mumbling old woman who informed
"her that her husband and son had both gone to Madrid with the troops,"
"but would undoubtedly return in an hour or two, a statement which with"
her superior information the old gipsy took leave to doubt.
"The town of San Ildefonso lay beneath the chateâu, and to her right as"
La Giralda issued from the gates. The houses were of an aspect at once
"grave and cheerful. They had been built mostly, not for permanent"
"residence, but in order to accommodate the hordes of courtiers and their"
"suites who, in the summer months, followed the royal personages over the"
mountains from Madrid.
"As most of these had fled at the first invasion of the cholera, the"
"windows, at this period of the year generally bright with flowers and"
"shaded with emerald barred _jalousies_, were closely shut up, and upon"
several of the closed doors appeared the fatal black and white notices
"of the municipality, which indicated that there either was or had been a"
case of the plague within the infected walls.
La Giralda went down the streets uttering the long wailing cry which
indicated that she had firewood to sell. But though she could have
"disposed of the milk from the goats over and over again, there appeared"
"but little demand for her other commodity, even though she called,"
"""_Leña-a-a-a! Ah, leña-a-a-a!_"" from one end of San Ildefonso to the"
expressed the needs of his fellow-playmates when he said: “I want to go
to the place where the shadows are real.” This is the true definition
"of “Faerie” lands, and is the first sign of real mental development"
in the child when he is no longer content with the stories of his own
"little deeds and experiences, when his ear begins to appreciate sounds"
"different from the words in his own everyday language, and when he"
begins to separate his own personality from the action of the story.
George Goschen says[26]:
“What I want for the young are books and stories which do not simply
deal with our daily life. I like the fancy (even) of little children
"to have some larger food than images of their own little lives, and"
I confess I am sorry for the children whose imaginations are not
sometimes stimulated by beautiful Fairy Tales which carry them to
worlds different from those in which their future will be passed....
I hold that what removes them more or less from their daily life is
better than what reminds them of it at every step.”
It is because of the great value of leading children to something
beyond the limited circle of their own lives that I deplore the
twaddling boarding-school stories written for girls and the
artificially-prepared Public School stories for boys. Why not give them
"the dramatic interest of a larger stage? No account of a cricket match,"
"or a football triumph, could present a finer appeal to boys and girls"
than the description of the Peacestead in the “Heroes of Asgaard”:
"“This was the playground of the Æsir, where they practised trials of"
skill one with another and held tournaments and sham fights. These last
were always conducted in the gentlest and most honourable manner; for
"the strongest law of the Peacestead was, that no angry blow should be"
"struck, or spiteful word spoken upon the sacred field.”"
But here Grey stood firm.  Nothing would induce him to cumber his head
with one of those mountains of hair.  In vain the perruquiers displayed
"their wares; in vain Lord Sandford bantered and laughed, and made out"
that he would be reckoned as a mad fellow by the young bloods of the
city.  Grey would not yield an inch.  He had always found his own hair
"sufficient and comfortable, and he would wear it to the end.  And as the"
"discomfited perruquier at last departed, Lord Sandford broke into"
another of his great laughs.
"""I’ faith you are right, man.  I like you the better that you have the"
"courage of your opinions, and care no whit for fashion.  You’ll be a"
match for more than the perruquiers yet.  There’s a fighting strain in
"your blood.  I can see it in the glint of your eye. Well, you shall not"
lack opportunity to fight as well as to laugh here in London town; but
we’ll not have cold steel or hot lead again.  I’ve seen enough of that
"cursed duelling to last me for a lifetime."""
Grey was quickly to discover the nature of the battles in which he was
"to take a part, and at the first he shrank from them with an instinctive"
"aversion he could not well have defined, being no grave moralist or"
philosopher.  Contests of skill or of luck at the gaming tables were all
"the rage of the day with the young dandies of the town, and the man who"
"could keep a steady head, and in some cases a steady hand, was certain"
in the long run to obtain advantage over his fellows.  At one club a
"game something like our modern billiards was all the rage; and, of"
"course, a man who was moderate in his cups could score heavily over the"
"reckless, dissipated bloods, who were seldom sober after sundown.  Dice"
and cards had their vogue at other places; and though some of the games
"played were those purely of chance, others required no small skill and a"
"clear head to ensure success, and it was here that Lord Sandford’s"
strong head and Grey’s cool blood and temperate habits gave them the
advantage.
"her ears all the way. The sergeant and Rollo came next, with Mortimer"
"and Etienne behind, a naked blade in the hand of each, for Rollo had"
"whispered the word to draw swords. This, however, El Sarria interpreted"
"to mean his faithful Manchegan knife, to which he trusted more than to"
any sword of Toledo that ever was forged.
At any other time they could not have advanced a score of yards without
"being brought to a stand-still by the challenge of a sentry, the whistle"
"of a rifle bullet, or the simultaneous turning out of the guard. But now"
no such danger was to be apprehended. All was still as a graveyard
before cock-crow.
"It is hard, in better and wiser days, when things are beginning to be"
"traced to their causes, to give any idea of the effect of the first"
appearance of Black Cholera among a population at once so simple and so
superstitious as that of rural Spain. The inhabitants of the great
"towns, the Cristino armies in the field, the country-folk of all"
opinions were universally persuaded that the dread disease was caused by
the monks in revenge for the despites offered to them; especially by the
"hated Jesuits, who were supposed to have thrown black cats alive into"
rivers and wells in order to produce disease by means of witchcraft and
diabolical agency.
So universal was this belief that so soon as the plague broke out in any
"city or town the neighbouring monasteries were immediately plundered,"
and the priors and brethren either put to death or compelled to flee for
their lives.
Some such panic as this had stampeded the troops stationed in and about
"the little town of San Ildefonso, when the first cases of cholera proved"
fatal little more than a week before. A part of these had rushed away to
"plunder the rich monastery of El Parral a few miles off, lying in the"
linen paper were held so high that the expense of an extra leaf was
considered an unnecessary luxury. In these books that which took the
"place of the title was at the end, the colophon being in evidence,"
"indicating the name of the illuminator, if not always that of the"
"printer. As was the case with the manuscript book, the volume began"
"with the phrase, ""Here beginneth...."" Later came piratical reprints,"
which resulted in making the critical reader insist upon having each
"volume stamped with the printer's name or mark, as a guarantee of"
reliable workmanship.
The first definite step in the direction of the title-page is marked
"by bibliographers in a little volume printed by Arnold Ther Hoernen,"
"of Cologne, in 1470. It consisted of an introduction at the head of"
"a page, the major part of which was left blank. Whether the printer"
"forgot to place the usual introduction at the head of the first page,"
"and took this way to remedy his error, is not known."
"In general, different faces of type should never be combined upon the"
"title-page, the variations being secured by using smaller sizes of the"
"same face, or harmonizing fonts. Capitals and lower-case letters can be"
successfully combined on the title-page only as a result of care and
"thought, the best title-pages usually being all in lower-case or all in"
caps and small caps. A two-color title-page is rarely a success unless
"it was originally composed with two colors in mind, instead of being"
set up in black and arbitrarily split up for colors.
"The decoration should never overbalance the type, and this applies"
as well to the question of borders on decorated books. No matter how
"beautiful, if the decoration overbalances the type, the volume or the"
title-page ceases to be an example of typography and becomes something
answerable only to itself.
of the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for
some guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this
"petition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on"
furlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He
"journeys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is"
concerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops
"(November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are"
nearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and
"there he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident"
islanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the
house of a personal opponent.
Other events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to
"France. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican"
patriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return
and enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of
"liberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the"
consequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many
"Corsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of"
Napoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of
the French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The
conduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of
ingratitude towards France. The decree of the French National
"Assembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by"
acts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly
"dispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and"
"recognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,"
"amidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and"
"behaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be"
"assured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred"
long nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not
"to be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was"
"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far"
"away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so"
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and
"leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a"
"cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch"
"to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for"
the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
"walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he"
"crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O,"
"you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing"
"terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the"
"stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked"
him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his
"shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite"
"white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You"
"fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it"
"had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes"
"cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out"
"in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his"
"jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had"
"raised itself from the ground on one side. ""Yes, and I'm sure it is"
"because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy. But when he"
"looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under"
"the stone. ""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one"
"lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" And he took the"
"chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole"
pile of money. But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
"of the water. ""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will"
"float,"" said the boy. And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket"
"home with him. He told his mother what had happened to him, that the"
"stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver"
sanguinary purification imparted by the taurobolium was more efficacious
than baptism. The food that was taken during the mystic feasts was likened
to the bread and wine of the communion; the Mother of the Gods was
"undoubtedly placed above the Mother of God, whose son also had risen again."
"A Christian author, writing at Rome about the year 375, furnishes some"
"remarkable information on this subject. As we have seen, a mournful"
"ceremony was celebrated on March 24th, the _dies sanguinis_ in the course"
of which the _galli_ shed their blood and sometimes mutilated themselves in
"commemoration of the wound that had caused Attis's death, ascribing an"
expiatory and atoning power to the blood thus shed. The pagans {71} claimed
that the church had copied their most sacred rites by placing her Holy Week
at the vernal equinox in commemoration of the sacrifice of the cross on
"which the divine Lamb, according to the church, had redeemed the human"
"race. Indignant at these blasphemous pretensions, St. Augustine tells of"
having known a priest of Cybele who kept saying: _Et ipse Pileatus
"christianus est_--""and even the god with the Phrygian cap [i. e., Attis] is"
"a Christian.""[42]"
But all efforts to maintain a barbarian religion stricken with moral
decadence were in vain. On the very spot on which the last taurobolia took
"place at the end of the fourth century, in the _Phrygianum_, stands to-day"
the basilica of the Vatican.

There is no Oriental religion whose progressive evolution we could follow
"at Rome so closely as the cult of Cybele and Attis, none that shows so"
plainly one of the reasons that caused their common decay and
"disappearance. They all dated back to a remote period of barbarism, and"
from that savage past they inherited a number of myths the odium of which
"could be masked but not eradicated by philosophical symbolism, and"
practices whose fundamental coarseness had survived from a period of rude
"inevitable negative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers,"
"agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres"
from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find
what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find
"her. He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great,"
"water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous"
"quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its"
upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.
The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of
"pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the"
specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected
"gleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of a"
"couch and two chairs, a foot-wide cheap pier glass between the two"
"windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a"
corner.
"The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in"
"speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to"
him of its divers tenantry.
"A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical"
islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the
gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from
"house to house—The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding"
"Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel’s chastely severe outline"
was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew
like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate
flotsam cast aside by the room’s marooned when a lucky sail had borne
"them to a fresh port—a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a"
"medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck."
though he himself were the captain. The captain asked what sort of
"nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's"
being entrusted with the command of a ship. But the boy answered that
was all one to him; if they did not care to buy the three cords of
"birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a"
single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
"advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would"
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
"seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted"
"to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that"
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
"quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he"
"likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. So"
"the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they"
set sail.
"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the"
"weather was fair and quiet; but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and"
"with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. The"
"captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a"
captain we have now. Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail
"this very minute?"" ""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long."""
"Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought"
"they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would"
undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the
ship.
"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard,"
"billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them"
"touch the other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did"
not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
He has made out of the teaching a new teaching that is very far from
"that of the Buddha, and the teaching is this: When a man dies his soul"
"remains, his 'I' has only changed its habitation. Still it lives and"
"breathes on earth, not the effect, but the soul itself. It is reborn"
"among us, and it may even be recognised very often in its new abode."
"And that we should never forget this, that we should never doubt that"
"this is true, it has been so ordered that many can remember something of"
these former lives of theirs. This belief is not to a Burman a mere
"theory, but is as true as anything he can see. For does he not daily see"
"people who know of their former lives? Nay, does he not himself, often"
"vaguely, have glimpses of that former life of his? No man seems to be"
"quite without it, but of course it is clearer to some than others. Just"
"as we tell stories in the dusk of ghosts and second sight, so do they,"
"when the day's work is over, gossip of stories of second birth; only"
that they believe in them far more than we do in ghosts.
A friend of mine put up for the night once at a monastery far away in
the forest near a small village. He was travelling with an escort of
"mounted police, and there was no place else to sleep but in the"
"monastery. The monk was, as usual, hospitable, and put what he had, bare"
"house-room, at the officer's disposal, and he and his men settled down"
for the night.
"After dinner a fire was built on the ground, and the officer went and"
sat by it and talked to the headman of the village and the monk. First
"they talked of the dacoits and of crops, unfailing subjects of interest,"
and gradually they drifted from one subject to another till the
"Englishman remarked about the monastery, that it was a very large and"
fine one for such a small secluded village to have built. The monastery
"was of the best and straightest teak, and must, he thought, have taken a"
"very long time and a great deal of labour to build, for the teak must"

are indicated are very rare. I never saw such a one myself.
"(vii) If a hæmothorax suppurates, it must be treated on the ordinary"
lines of an empyema. In view of the constant formation of adhesions and
"difficulty in drainage, a portion of a rib should always be resected in"
"order to ensure sufficient space for after-treatment. The cavities, as a"
"rule, are better irrigated, the usual precautions being taken where"
there is any reason to fear that the lung is still in communication with
the cavity.
"Care in carrying out asepsis in tapping, which should be performed with"
"an aspirator, need hardly be more than mentioned. It will be noted that"
"in some of the cases quoted suppuration followed tapping, but it must be"
remembered that in these the two primary wounds already existed as
possible channels of infection.
Retained bullets of small calibre in the thoracic cavity were not
"common, unless the lodgment had occurred in the bodies of the vertebræ."
"I saw very few. Shrapnel bullets and fragments of shells, however, were,"
"in proportion to the frequency of wounds from such projectiles, more"
commonly retained. The rules to be followed in such cases do not
materially deviate from those to be observed in the body generally.
"When the bullet is causing no trouble, and is lodged in either the bone"
"of the spine or the lung substance, no interference is advisable. When,"
"on the other hand, the bullet as viewed by the X-rays is seen to be in"
"the pleural cavity, and any symptoms of its presence exist, it may be"
justifiable to remove it. I saw this done in one case for the removal of
a shrapnel bullet from the lower reflexion of the pleura on account of
"fixed pain and tenderness complained of by the patient. The bullet, a"
only subtlety and arid ingenuity. All symbolism and allegory were
"fundamentally alien to him and indifferent, though he occasionally tried"
his hand at an allegory; and he never was mystically inclined.
Now here it is just as much the deficiencies of his own mind as the
qualities of the system which made him unable to appreciate it. While he
struck at the abuse of ceremonies and of Church practices both with
"noble indignation and well-aimed mockery, a proud irony to which he was"
not fully entitled preponderates in his condemnation of scholastic
theology which he could not quite understand. It was easy always to talk
with a sneer of the conservative divines of his time as _magistri
nostri_.
His noble indignation hurt only those who deserved castigation and
"strengthened what was valuable, but his mockery hurt the good as well as"
"the bad in spite of him, assailed both the institution and persons, and"
injured without elevating them. The individualist Erasmus never
"understood what it meant to offend the honour of an office, an order, or"
"an establishment, especially when that institution is the most sacred of"
"all, the Church itself."
Erasmus's conception of the Church was no longer purely Catholic. Of
that glorious structure of medieval-Christian civilization with its
"mystic foundation, its strict hierarchic construction, its splendidly"
fitting symmetry he saw hardly anything but its load of outward details
and ornament. Instead of the world which Thomas Aquinas and Dante had
"described, according to their vision, Erasmus saw another world, full of"
"charm and elevated feeling, and this he held up before his compatriots."

They did not stop at the street level; they continued on down another
"ramp, around a bend, descending an even steeper incline toward the"
bowels of Jupiter. Their descent ended at last before a huge metal
"barrier which, at a signal from the leader, drew smoothly up into the"
"ceiling to disclose a gigantic, red-lit chamber underlying the"
foundations of the building.
"In fear and awe, Dex gazed around that huge room."
It resembled in part a nightmare rearrangement of such a laboratory as
might be found on Earth; and in part a torture chamber such as the
most ferocious of savages might have devised had they been
scientifically equipped to add contrivances of supercivilization to
the furthering of their primitive lust for cruelty.
There were great benches--head-high to the Earthman--to accommodate
the height of the Rogan workmen. There were numberless metal
"instruments, and glass coils, and enormous retorts; and in one corner"
"an orange colored flame burnt steadily on a naked metal plate, seeming"
to have no fuel or other source of being.
There was a long rack of cruelly pointed and twisted instruments.
"Under this was a row of long, delicate pincers, with coils on the"
handles to indicate that they might be heated to fiendish precision of
temperatures. There were gleaming metal racks with calibrated
slide-rods and spring dials to denote just what pull was being exerted
on whatever unhappy creature might be stretched taut on them. There
"were tiny cones of metal whose warped, baked appearance testified that"
they were little portable furnaces that could be placed on any desired
"portion of the anatomy, to slowly bake the selected disk of flesh"
beneath them.
"first holiday which she had known since August, 1914. She always seems"
to travel with fewer restrictions and at greater speed than any except
Prime Ministers and commanding Generals. In Italy she is an Italian and
in France a Frenchwoman--a dazzling Italian and a very winning
Frenchwoman. The police of both countries make smooth her path with
their humble bodies upon which Madame is graciously pleased to trample.
"""I never trouble much about passports or credentials,"" says she, ""though"
I carry them just as I do my .25 automatic pistol; in practice I find
that I need draw my papers as rarely as I draw my gun. Most of the
"police and officials who have seen me once know me when I come again,"
"and rush to my assistance."" She is never grateful for service. I do not"
believe she knows the sentiment of gratitude. A poor man renders her aid
"in defiance of regulations, and maybe at the risk of his neck; she"
"smiles upon him, and the debt is instantly discharged. He is dismissed"
until perchance Madame may again have occasion for his devotion. Then
she reveals the royal accomplishment of never forgetting a face. Imagine
"a harassed, weary _chef du train_, before whose official unseeing eyes"
"travellers flit like figures on a cinema screen, imagine such a one"
addressed by name and rank by the most beautiful and gracious of mortal
"women, by a woman who remembers all those little family confidences"
"which he had poured into her sympathetic ears some twelve months before,"
by a woman who enquires sweetly after his good wife--using her pet
name--laments that the brave son--also accurately named--is still
missing beyond those impenetrable Boche lines. Will not the _chef du
"train_, cooed over thus and softly patted as one pats butter, break"
every French rule the most iron-bound to speed Madame upon her way? Of
"course he will. In war time, as in peace time, that is the royal manner"
of Madame Gilbert. She does not travel; she makes a progress.
"Madame came home after the armistice with Austria, and, being discharged"
"of liability to the propagandist headquarters, found herself a free and"
idle woman. The first time for more than four years.
"able to talk. But you must leave this place."" The girl said: ""Then I"
would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of
"speech""--and such she became, but from that time on she was dumb."
"Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and had wandered for a"
"time, she came to a large, large wood, and no matter how far she went"
"she could not reach its end. When evening came, she climbed into a high"
"tree that stood over a spring, and sat down in its branches to sleep."
"Not far from it stood a king's castle, and early the next morning a"
"serving-maid came from it, to get water from the spring for the prince's"
"tea. And when the serving-maid saw the lovely face in the spring, she"
thought it was her own. At once she threw down her pail and ran back
"home holding her head high, and saying: ""If I am as beautiful as all"
"that, I am too good to carry water in a pail!"" Then another was sent to"
"fetch water, but the same thing happened with her; she, too, came back"
and said she was far too handsome and too good to go to the spring and
"fetch water for the prince. Then the prince went himself, for he wanted"
"to see what it all meant. And when he came to the spring, he also saw"
"the picture, and at once looked up into the tree. And so he saw the"
"lovely maiden who was seated among its branches. He coaxed her down,"
"took her back home with him, and nothing would do but that she must be"
"his bride, because she was so beautiful. But his mother, who was still"
"living, objected: ""She cannot speak,"" said she, ""and, maybe, she"
"belongs to the troll-folk."" But the prince would not be satisfied until"
"he had won her. When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon the"
"queen, the prince set a strong guard about her. But suddenly they all"
"fell asleep, and her foster-mother came, cut the child's little finger,"
"rubbed some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the queen, and"
"said: ""Now you shall grieve just as I did when you let the star slip"
"out!"" And with that she disappeared with the child. When those whom the"
"prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again, they thought that"
"the queen had devoured her child, and the old queen wanted to have her"
"advantage, was now slightly in advance."
The black stallion had just reached the downward dip leading to the deep
ditch filled with gorse bushes. His rider had had perforce to pull him
"up somewhat, lest he should slip and fall, for the ground was sandy and"
treacherous.  But Don Carlos had been born and bred to this sort of wild
"work, and dashing onwards and downwards with the agility of a deer, came"
"neck and neck with his rival, and having passed the Arab, cleared with a"
"bound the treacherous gully, landing true and safe upon the opposite"
"side.  The Arab followed in his tracks, his rider taking advantage of"
"the lead given; but the black stallion slipped and snorted, could not be"
"made to try the leap till another of the horses came up and took it,"
after which he sprang across with a vicious energy which tried the
"horsemanship of his rider, and tore like a wild thing after the leading"
pair.
These had cleared one after the other the wall and ditch; but the Arab
"was showing signs of distress, whilst Don Carlos looked fresh and eager"
as at the start.  There now remained only a quarter of a mile of smooth
"sward, and then the last critical jump; and Grey, knowing himself first,"
"and not knowing what had betided his rivals, sailed happily onward,"
"secure of victory, though he heard behind him the thud of flying horse"
"hoofs, and knew that the black stallion was not beaten yet.  It was he"
"who snorted with such excitement and fury, and seemed to awaken thunders"
with his iron-shod hoofs.
"One glance over his shoulder, and Grey passed his whip very lightly"
across the neck of Don Carlos. The gallant animal sprang forward like an
"arrow from a bow, showing how well within himself he had been travelling"
so far.  The sound of other beating hoofs was fainter now.  Grey looked
"keenly at the great obstacle looming up in his path, and measured the"
"height at various places, deciding where the leap could best be taken."
admitted to this school to be educated at the charges of the King of
"France (April, 1779). He was now, at the tender age of nine, a"
"stranger in a strange land, among a people whom he detested as the"
"oppressors of his countrymen. Worst of all, he had to endure the taunt"
of belonging to a subject race. What a position for a proud and
exacting child! Little wonder that the official report represented him
"as silent and obstinate; but, strange to say, it added the word"
"""imperious."" It was a tough character which could defy repression"
"amidst such surroundings. As to his studies, little need be said. In"
his French history he read of the glories of the distant past (when
"""Germany was part of the French Empire""), the splendours of the reign"
"of Louis XIV., the disasters of France in the Seven Years' War, and"
"the ""prodigious conquests of the English in India."" But his"
imagination was kindled from other sources. Boys of pronounced
character have always owed far more to their private reading than to
"their set studies; and the young Buonaparte, while grudgingly learning"
"Latin and French grammar, was feeding his mind on Plutarch's"
"""Lives""--in a French translation. The artful intermingling of the"
"actual and the romantic, the historic and the personal, in those vivid"
"sketches of ancient worthies and heroes, has endeared them to many"
minds. Rousseau derived unceasing profit from their perusal; and
"Madame Roland found in them ""the pasture of great souls."" It was so"
with the lonely Corsican youth. Holding aloof from his comrades in
"gloomy isolation, he caught in the exploits of Greeks and Romans a"
distant echo of the tragic romance of his beloved island home. The
librarian of the school asserted that even then the young soldier had
modelled his future career on that of the heroes of antiquity; and we
"may well believe that, in reading of the exploits of Leonidas,"
"Curtius, and Cincinnatus, he saw the figure of his own antique"
"republican hero, Paoli. To fight side by side with Paoli against the"
"French was his constant dream. ""Paoli will return,"" he once exclaimed,"
"""and as soon as I have strength, I will go to help him: and perhaps"
intestine area without inflicting any injury.
"The sum of my experience, in fact, was to encourage the belief that,"
unless the intestine was struck in such a direction as to render lateral
"displacement an impossibility, the gut often escaped perforation."
"As a rule, the wounds of the abdomen which from their position proved"
the most dangerous to the intestine were--
"1. Wounds passing from one flank to the other were very dangerous, as"
"crossing complicated coils of the small intestine, and two fixed"
portions of the colon. This danger was most marked when the wounds were
situated between the eighth rib in the mid axillary line and the crest
"of the ilium; above this level the liver, or possibly liver and stomach,"
"were sometimes alone implicated, and the cases did well. Again, when the"
wounds crossed the false pelvis the patients sometimes escaped all
injury to viscera.
2. Antero-posterior wounds in the small intestine area were very fatal
if the course was direct; in such the small intestine seldom escaped
injury.
3. Wounds with a certain degree of obliquity from anterior wall to
"flank, or from flank to loin, were on the other hand comparatively"
"favourable, as the small intestine often escaped, and if any gut was"
"wounded, it was often the colon."
"4. Vertical wounds implicating the chest and abdomen, or the abdomen and"
"pelvis, were on the whole not very unfavourable. For instance, when the"
"bullet entered by the buttock and emerged below the umbilicus, a number"
of patients escaped fatal injury; this depended on the comparatively
good prognosis in wounds of the rectum and bladder. A good many
infer from the vast thicknesses of its rocks and the
unconformities which part them. We know that during its long
"periods land masses again and again rose from the sea, were worn"
"low, and were submerged and covered with the waste of other lands."
But the formations of separated regions cannot be correlated
"because of the absence of fossils, and nothing more can be made"
"out than the detached chapters of local histories, such as the"
outline given of the district about Lake Superior.
The pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work
upon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now.
The most ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now
being laid that we may infer that they were formed under
conditions essentially similar to those of the present time. There
is no proof that the sands of the pre-Cambrian sandstones were
swept by any more powerful waves and currents than are offshore
"sands to-day, or that the muds of the pre-Cambrian shales settled"
to the sea floor in less quiet water than such muds settle in at
"present. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt, worn by wind and"
"weather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as now, and, as"
"now, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves dashed and"
along which tidal currents ran.
Perhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the
present was the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have
"any knowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure"
"carpeted the plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the"
air. It is permitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts
of barren rock and rock waste swept by rains and trenched by
powerful streams. We may therefore suppose that the processes of
their destruction went on more rapidly than at present.
"camp. At Brienne he had been dubbed ""the Spartan,"" an instance of that"
almost uncanny faculty of schoolboys to dash off in a nickname the
"salient features of character. The phrase was correct, almost for"
"Napoleon's whole life. At any rate, the pomp of Paris served but to"
root his youthful affections more tenaciously in the rocks of Corsica.
"In September, 1785, that is, at the age of sixteen, Buonaparte was"
nominated for a commission as junior lieutenant in La Fère regiment of
artillery quartered at Valence on the Rhone. This was his first close
contact with real life. The rules of the service required him to
spend three months of rigorous drill before he was admitted to his
"commission. The work was exacting: the pay was small, viz., 1,120"
"francs, or less than £45, a year; but all reports agree as to his keen"
zest for his profession and the recognition of his transcendent
abilities by his superior officers.[8] There it was that he mastered
"the rudiments of war, for lack of which many generals of noble birth"
have quickly closed in disaster careers that began with promise:
"there, too, he learnt that hardest and best of all lessons, prompt"
"obedience. ""To learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing,"""
says Carlyle. It was so with Napoleon: at Valence he served his
apprenticeship in the art of conquering and the art of governing.
This spring-time of his life is of interest and importance in many
"ways: it reveals many amiable qualities, which had hitherto been"
blighted by the real or fancied scorn of the wealthy cadets. At
"Valence, while shrinking from his brother officers, he sought society"
more congenial to his simple tastes and restrained demeanour. In a few
"of the best bourgeois families of Valence he found happiness. There,"
"too, blossomed the tenderest, purest idyll of his life. At the country"
"house of a cultured lady who had befriended him in his solitude, he"
"saw his first love, Caroline de Colombier. It was a passing fancy;"
but to her all the passion of his southern nature welled forth. She
in cultured and easy manners. Close by are some of his intellectual
peculiarities. He hates the violent and extravagant. Therefore the
choruses of the Greek drama displease him. The merit of his own poems he
"sees in the fact that they pass passion by, they abstain from pathos"
"altogether--'there is not a single storm in them, no mountain torrent"
"overflowing its banks, no exaggeration whatever. There is great"
frugality in words. My poetry would rather keep within bounds than
"exceed them, rather hug the shore than cleave the high seas.' In another"
place he says: 'I am always most pleased by a poem that does not differ
"too much from prose, but prose of the best sort, be it understood. As"
Philoxenus accounted those the most palatable fishes that are no true
"fishes and the most savoury meat what is no meat, the most pleasant"
"voyage, that along the shores, and the most agreeable walk, that along"
the water's edge; so I take especial pleasure in a rhetorical poem and a
"poetical oration, so that poetry is tasted in prose and the reverse.'"
"That is the man of half-tones, of fine shadings, of the thought that is"
never completely expressed. But he adds: 'Farfetched conceits may please
others; to me the chief concern seems to be that we draw our speech from
the matter itself and apply ourselves less to showing off our invention
than to present the thing.' That is the realist.
"From this conception results his admirable, simple clarity, the"
excellent division and presentation of his argument. But it also causes
his lack of depth and the prolixity by which he is characterized. His
machine runs too smoothly. In the endless _apologiae_ of his later
"years, ever new arguments occur to him; new passages to point, or"
"quotations to support, his idea. He praises laconism, but never"
"practises it. Erasmus never coins a sentence which, rounded off and"
"pithy, becomes a proverb and in this manner lives. There are no current"
quotations from Erasmus. The collector of the _Adagia_ has created no
new ones of his own.
"though he could not read it then and there, he could see, by casting his"
"eyes over it, that there were many very fine periods in it, and that it"
"was filled with descriptive passages of some great battle, and the"
energy and glory of the General in command. He raised his eyes
"inquiringly to the impassioned face of the author, which was working"
with excitement.
"""See you not something of the form?  It is a dramatic interlude.  It"
should be played upon the stage during the intervals of the play.  Time
"sits aloft, aged and grim, his scythe in his hand, his hour-glass beside"
"him, and he speaks of the decay of mankind—that the world’s greatness is"
"vanishing, its men of genius growing ever fewer and fewer.  That is my"
part.  I take the _rôle_ of Time.  To him then enters one in the guise
of youth—one in the flush of manhood’s prime—one who has seen great and
"doughty deeds, and comes to rehearse the same in the ears of old Time,"
"to bid him change his tune, to tell him that giants yet live upon the"
earth.  This youth comes with songs of victory; he speaks of what he has
seen; he describes in burning words and glowing colours that last great
fight wherein England’s General put to flight the hosts of the haughty
monarch of France.  For months has this been written; for months have I
gone about seeking the man to take the part of youth and manhood. But I
have sought in vain.  All those whom I would have chosen have other work
"to do, and did but laugh at me.  Those who would gladly do my bidding, I"
"will none of.  You saw how they did mouth and rant to-night, thinking to"
"show their talent, when they only displayed their imbecile folly. But"
here have I found the very man for whom I have long waited.  You have
"youth, beauty—that manly beauty which transcends, to my thinking, the"
ephemeral loveliness of woman; you have the gift; you have seen the
"great hero: you have caught the very trick of his words and speech.  Oh,"
"I know it!  Once did I hear him address the House of Lords, and when you"
spoke I seemed to see and hear him again.  The great world of fashion
will go mad over you.  We shall draw full houses; we shall succeed.  I
"sitting in my room talking to them, when a knock came at the door, and"
"I found there a poor woman belonging to the neighbourhood, but who also"
combined in my dream the page-boy at a dear friend's house. From this
"friend, whom I had not heard from for some time, the woman bore a large"
"letter. She tore it open in my presence, saying, ""It says here that the"
"bearer is to open this,"" and produced from it another letter, a large"
document of a legal character in my friend's handwriting. When the woman
began to open the second letter I remonstrated; I was sure that there was
"some mistake, that that letter was private, and that no one else ought to"
"see it. The woman, however, firmly insisted that she must carry out her"
instructions; so we had a long discussion. After a time I called Mrs. F.
and appealed to her. She agreed with me that the instructions must only
"mean that the bearer was to open the outer envelope, not the inner letter."
"At last I took out five shillings and gave it to the woman, telling her"
that I would assume all the responsibility for opening the letter myself.
"With this she went away well satisfied, saying (as she would in real"
"life), ""All right, Mrs. ----, you're a lady, and you know. All right,"
"my dear."" Then at last I was able to tear open my letter and read these"
"words: ""_Always use Sunlight Soap_."" My vexation was extreme.'"
On another occasion the same dreamer experienced remorse. She imagined she
"was in a restaurant, and the girl behind the counter pointed to a barrel"
"of beer--a golden barrel, she said, with a magic key--which could only be"
"opened by the owner. The dreamer declared, however, that she could open"
"it, and, producing a key, proceeded to do so, handing round beer to the"
"bystanders. Then she realised that she had been stealing, and was full of"
"remorse. She asked a friend if she ought to tell the owner, but the friend"
"replied, 'By no means.' This conclusion of the dream seems to indicate"
"that the moral sense, though present in dreams, is apt to be impaired."
In yet another dream this dreamer exhibited a curious combination of moral
"sensibility and criminal indifference. She imagined that, while walking"
"in the building. Nevertheless, its chief attraction, to the devout"
"Roman Catholic mind, is neither the bones of the Maccabees nor the"
"statue of Moses, but the chains referred to in the following familiar"
"passage of Scripture: ""Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer"
was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod
"would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between"
two soldiers bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door
"kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a"
"light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised"
"him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his"
"hands."" (Acts xii. 5-7.) These two chains were presented by Juvenal,"
"Bishop of Jerusalem, to the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius the"
"younger, who placed one of them in the Basilica of the apostles in"
"Constantinople and sent the other to Rome, where this church was"
erected as its special shrine. This was about the middle of the fifth
"century. ""But the Romans could not rest satisfied with the possession"
"of half the relic; and within the walls of this very basilica, Leo"
I. beheld in a vision the miraculous and mystical uniting of the two
"chains, since which they have both been exhibited here, and the day of"
"their being soldered together by invisible power, August 1st, has been"
"kept sacred in the Latin church!"" ""They are of unequal size, owing to"
"many fragments of one of them (first whole links, then only filings)"
having been removed in the course of centuries by various popes and
sent to Christian princes who have been esteemed worthy of the favor!
The longest is about five feet in length. At the end of one of them is
"a collar, which is said to have encircled the neck of St. Peter. They"
are exposed on the day of the 'station' (the first Monday in Lent) in a
"reliquary presented by Pius IX., adorned with statuettes of St. Peter"
"and the Angel--to whom he is represented as saying, '_Ecce nunc scio"
vere_' (Acts xii. II). On the following day a priest gives the chains
"to be kissed by the pilgrims, and touches their foreheads with them,"
"saying, 'By the intercession of the blessed Apostle Peter, may God"
"Auxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the"
"miasma of the marshes of the river Saône, but also from family"
anxieties and arduous literary toils. To these last it is now needful
"to refer. Indeed, the external events of his early life are of value"
only as they reveal the many-sidedness of his nature and the growth of
his mental powers.
How came he to outgrow the insular patriotism of his early years? The
foregoing recital of facts must have already suggested one obvious
"explanation. Nature had dowered him so prodigally with diverse gifts,"
"mainly of an imperious order, that he could scarcely have limited his"
"sphere of action to Corsica. Profoundly as he loved his island, it"
offered no sphere commensurate with his varied powers and masterful
will. It was no empty vaunt which his father had uttered on his
deathbed that his Napoleon would one day overthrow the old monarchies
and conquer Europe.[9] Neither did the great commander himself
"overstate the peculiarity of his temperament, when he confessed that"
"his instincts had ever prompted him that his will must prevail, and"
that what pleased him must of necessity belong to him. Most spoilt
"children harbour the same illusion, for a brief space. But all the"
buffetings of fortune failed to drive it from the young Buonaparte;
and when despair as to his future might have impaired the vigour of
"his domineering instincts, his mind and will acquired a fresh rigidity"
"by coming under the spell of that philosophizing doctrinaire,"
Rousseau.
There was every reason why he should early be attracted by this
"fantastic thinker. In that notable work, ""Le Contrat Social"" (1762),"
Rousseau called attention to the antique energy shown by the Corsicans
"in defence of their liberties, and in a startlingly prophetic phrase"
he exclaimed that the little island would one day astonish Europe. The
source of this predilection of Rousseau for Corsica is patent. Born
"had time to assert itself, I took advantage of a momentary reaction and"
"said: “Now, children, don't you think we can pay England the tribute"
of going back to England's greatest poet?” In a few minutes we were
"back in the heart of the Forest, and I can still hear the delightful"
intonation of those subdued voices repeating:
Golden lads and girls all must
Like chimney-sweepers come to dust.
It is interesting to note that the same problem that is exercising
us to-day was a source of difficulty to people in remote times. The
"following is taken from an old Chinese document, and has particular"
interest for us to-day.
“The Philosopher Mentius (born 371 B.C.) was left fatherless at a very
tender age and brought up by his mother Changsi. The care of this
prudent and attentive mother has been cited as a model for all virtuous
parents. The house she occupied was near that of a butcher: she
"observed at the first cry of the animals that were being slaughtered,"
"the little Mentius ran to be present at the sight, and that, on his"
"return, he sought to imitate what he had seen. Fearful lest his heart"
"might become hardened, and accustomed to the sights of blood, she"
removed to another house which was in the neighbourhood of a cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to weep upon
"their graves, and make their customary libations. The lad soon took"
pleasure in their ceremonies and amused himself by imitating them.
This was a new subject of uneasiness to his mother: she feared her
son might come to consider as a jest what is of all things the most
"serious, and that he might acquire a habit of performing with levity,"
"and as a matter of routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most"
exact attention and respect. Again therefore she anxiously changed the
"dwelling, and went to live in the city, opposite to a school, where her"
ship in the military or naval service of any foreign state at war with
"any friendly state,--"
"Such person shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and"
"shall be punishable by fine and imprisonment, or either of such"
"punishments, at the discretion of the court before which the"
"offender is convicted; and imprisonment, if awarded, may be either"
with or without hard labour.
[Sidenote: Penalty on fitting out Naval or Military Expeditions without

"11. If any person within the limits of Her Majesty's dominions, and"
"without the license of Her Majesty,--"
Prepares or fits out any naval or military expedition to proceed against

"(1) Every person engaged in such preparation or fitting out, or"
"assisting therein, or employed in any capacity in such expedition,"
"shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall be"
"punishable by fine and imprisonment, or either of such"
"punishments, at the discretion of the court before which the"
"offender is convicted; and imprisonment, if awarded, may be either"

envy and undeserved hatred borne to me by the Lord Keeper.'[161] It is
not difficult to see in the Archbishop's relations to the Lord Keeper an
explanation of his dream.
"If, however, wishes, conscious or unconscious, are often fulfilled"
"in dreams, and if, as we have seen reason to conclude, symbolism is"
"a fundamental tendency of dreaming activity, it is inevitable that"
"wish-dreams should sometimes take on a symbolic form. It is thus, for"
"instance, that I interpret my dream of being in an English cathedral and"
seeing on the wall a notice to the effect that at evensong on such a day
"the edifice will not be illuminated, in order to avoid attracting moths;"
"I awake with a slight headache, and the unilluminated cathedral was"
the symbol of the coolness and absence of glare which one desires when
suffering from headache.
"There cannot, also, be any doubt that erotic wishes frequently make"
"themselves felt as dreams, both in the infantile and the symbolic form."
It is sufficient to bring forward one illustration. It is furnished
"by a young lady of somewhat neurotic tendencies and heredity, aged"
"twenty-three, musical and intelligent, who was in love with her"
"music-master, the organist at her church. The dream was written down at"
"the time. 'I was at the school of my childhood, and I was told that I"
"was St. Agnes Virgin and Martyr, and in five minutes' time I was to be"
beheaded with a large knife. The sheen of the blade frightened me so much
that I asked if instead I might be strangled by the man I was in love
with. Permission was given if I could induce him to come in time. I ran
"to our church (saying to myself that I knew it was a dream, but that I"
"_must_ see what he would say) over huge stones that cut my bare feet, and"
"wondered what age I was living in, longing to meet some women in order to"
"find out. When I did, they all wore crinolines. I rushed up the central"
"aisle, which was full of people, thinking that, as I was going to be"
"killed, nothing could matter. Mr. T. (the organist) was giving a choir"
NO thanksgiving?--Awake! Awake! the Voice you have yourselves set in
your high Cathedral towers reproaches your lack of love with its iron
"tongue, and summons you all to worship Him the Ever-Glorious, through"
whose mercy alone you live!
"To and fro,--to and fro,--gravely persistent, sublimely eloquent, the"
"huge, sustained, and heavy monotone went thudding through the"
"stillness,--till, startled from his profound sleep by such loud, lofty,"
"and incessant clangor, Alwyn turned on his pillow and listened,"
"half-aroused, half-bewildered,--then, remembering where he was, he"
understood; it was the great Bell of the Dom pealing forth its first
"summons to the earliest Mass. He lay quiet for a little while, dreamily"
counting the number of reverberations each separate stroke sent
"quivering on the air,--but presently, finding it impossible to sleep"
"again, he got up, and drawing aside the curtain looked out of the"
"window of his room, which fronted on the Platz. Though it was not yet"
"six o'clock, the city was all astir,--the Rhinelanders are an early"
"working people, and to see the sun rise is not with them a mere fiction"
"of poesy, but a daily fact. It was one of the loveliest of lovely"
"spring mornings--the sky was clear as a pale, polished sapphire, and"
every little bib of delicate carving and sculpture on the Dom stood out
from its groundwork with microscopically beautiful distinctness. And as
"his gaze rested on the perfect fairness of the day, a strange and"
"sudden sense of rapturous anticipation possessed his mind,--he felt as"
"one prepared for some high and exquisite happiness,--some great and"
"wondrous celebration or feast of joy! The thoughts of death, on which"
"he had brooded so persistently during the past yester-eve, had fled,"
"leaving no trace behind,--only a keen and vigorous delight in life"
"absorbed him now. It was good to be alive, even on this present earth!"
"it was good to see, to feel, to know! and there was much to be thankful"
for in the mere capability of easy and healthful breathing!
"on the Isthmus, though one hunter and trapper is said to have secured as"
"many as 60,000 in a year. But as the demand for the skins, and to a"
"lesser degree for the teeth, of the animals is a constant one, it is"
probable that with the aid of the tourists they will be exterminated
there as thoroughly as they have been in the settled parts of Florida.
While on the subject of slaughter and the extermination of game it may
be noted that the Canal Commission has already established very
"stringent game laws on the Zone, particularly for the protection of"
"plumed birds like the egret, and it is seriously proposed to make of"
that part of Gatun Lake within the Zone a refuge for birds in which no
shooting shall be permitted. Such action would stop mere wanton
"slaughter from the decks of passing steamers, and in the end would"
greatly enhance the beauty and interest of the trip through the lake
which would be fairly alive with birds and other animal life.

[Illustration: STREET IN DAVID]
The Bayano River region beside being the center of such lumbering
activities as the Zone knows at present is the section in which are
"found the curious vegetable ivory nuts which, though growing wild, have"
become one of the principal products of Panama. Only a few years ago
they were looked upon merely as curiosities but are now a useful new
material. They are gathered by the natives and sold to dealers in
Panama who ship them north to be made into buttons and other articles
of general use. Nobody has yet experimented with the cultivation of the
"tree, and there is reason to believe that with cultivation larger nuts"
"could be obtained, and, by planting, considerable groves established."
"The trees grow well in every part of the Darien, and the demand, with"
"now, or turned his ideas from the task before him. It was no ordinary"
"speech, and no ordinary occasion. He spoke only to five men out of all"
"his audience--the rest were his, or were beyond the power of his charm;"
"on those five important-looking, unhappy-feeling men he bent every"
"effort of his will, and played every device of his mind and his tongue."
"Now and then he distantly threatened them, oftener he made as though to"
convince their cool judgment; again he would invoke the sentiment of old
"alliance in them, or stir their pity for the men whose cause he pleaded."
"Once he flashed out in bitter mockery at Coxon, then jested in mild"
"irony at Puttock and his ""rich man's revolution."" Returning to his text,"
"he minutely dissected his own measure, insisting on its promise,"
"extenuating its fancied danger, claiming for it the merits of a"
courageous and well-conceived scheme. Through all the changes that he
"rang, he was heard with close attention, broken only by demonstrations"
of approval or of dissent. At last one of his periods extorted a cheer
from a waverer. It acted on him as a spur to fresh exertions. He raised
"his voice till it filled the chamber, and began his last and most"
elaborate appeal.
Suddenly a change came over his hearers. The breathless silence of
engrossed attention gave place to a subdued stir; whispers were heard
"here and there. Men were handing a newspaper about, accompanying its"
"transfer with meaning looks. He was not surprised, for members made no"
"scruple of reading their papers or writing their letters in the House,"
"but he was vexed to see that he had not gripped them closer. He went on,"
but that ever-circulating paper had half his attention now. He noticed
Kilshaw come in with it and press it on Sir Robert's notice. Sir Robert
"at first refused, but when Kilshaw urged, he read and glanced up at him,"
"so Medland thought, with a look of sadness. Coxon had got a paper now,"
"and left biting his nails to pore over it; he passed it to Puttock, and"
"the fat man bulged his cheeks in seeming wonder. Even his waverer, the"
"one who had cheered, was deep in it. Only Norburn was unconscious of it."
Lady Blount sighed. What with imperial governments that wrecked the
"career of men for shooting a few murderous and fire-raising blacks, and"
"with lowborn vixens of women who ruined men's careers in other ways,"
"life was a desperate puzzle. She was fond of her cousin John Risca. She,"
"too, before she married Sir Oliver, had borne the name, and the disgrace"
that had fallen upon it affected her deeply. It was horrible to think
"of John's wife, locked up that night in the stone cell of a gaol. She"
"leaned back in her chair in silence while the men talked--Sir Oliver,"
"by way of giving Risca hints on the conduct of life in Melbourne, was"
narrating his experiences of forty years ago in the West Indies--and
"stared into the fire. Her face, beneath the front of red hair that"
"accused so pitifully the reddish gray that was her own, looked very old"
"and faded. What was a prison like? She shuddered. As governor's wife,"
she had once or twice had occasion to visit a colonial prison. But the
"captives were black, and they grinned cheerily; their raiment, save for"
"the unæsthetic decoration of the black arrow, was not so very different"
"from that which they wore in a state of freedom; neither were food,"
"bedding, and surroundings so very different; and the place was flooded"
with air and blazing sunshine. She could never realize that it was
a real prison. It might have been a prison of musical comedy. But an
"English prison was the real, unimaginable abode of grim, gray horror."
She had heard of the prison taint. She conceived it as a smell--that of
mingled quicklime and the corruption it was to destroy--which lingered
physically forever after about the persons of those who had been
"confined within prison-walls. A gaol was a place of eternal twilight,"
"eternal chill, eternal degradation for the white man or woman; and a"
"white woman, the wife of one of her own race, was there. It was almost"
"as if the taint hung about her own lavender-scented self. She shivered,"
and drew her chair a few inches nearer the fire.
"Was it so preposterous, after all, on John Risca's part to fly from the"
"shame into a wider, purer air? Her cry had been unthinking, instinctive,"
rise of temperature.
_Symptoms of hæmothorax._--In the more severe cases of primary bleeding
"the symptoms did not, as a rule, reach their full height until the third"
or fourth day after the injury. The patients then often suffered
"severely. The pulse and temperature rose, and to general symptoms of"
loss of blood were added: occasional lividity of countenance; severe
"dyspnoea, accompanied by inability to lie on the sound side or to"
assume the supine position; absence of respiratory movement on the
"injured side; pain, restlessness, cough, and sometimes continuance of"
"hæmoptysis, small clots usually being expectorated."
Accompanying these symptoms were the usual physical signs of fluid in
the pleura in differing degrees and combination. Dulness of varying
"extent up to complete absence of resonance on one side, often"
accompanied in the incomplete cases by well-marked skodaic resonance
"anteriorly. Loss of vocal resonance, and fremitus; oegophony, tubular"
respiration over the root of the lung or at the upper limit of the
"dulness, and more or less extensive displacement of the heart. Obvious"
"increase in girth, fulness of the intercostal spaces, or gravitation"
ecchymosis was rare. The latter was most common in instances in which
multiple fracture of the ribs existed (see fig. 83). I think the rarity
of the last sign must have been due to the early coagulation of the
"blood, and its retention by the pleura, as I saw well-marked gravitation"
ecchymosis in one or two cases of mediastinal hæmorrhage.
"The above complex of symptoms was common to all the cases, but in the"
"slighter ones they gave rise to little trouble, and cleared up with"
great rapidity.
"[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Gravitation Ecchymosis in a case of Hæmothorax,"
accompanying fracture of three ribs from within. The influence of the
"If it is a double foetus with only one neck, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one spine, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one mouth, the land will remain"
under the command of the king.
"If it is a double foetus with only one breast, the land will be"
"enlarged, rule of a legitimate king."
In order to grasp the principles underlying the interpretation of such
"omens, we must take as our starting point the conceptions connected with"
the various parts of the body. Bearing in mind that the omens deal
primarily with public affairs and the general welfare and only to a
"limited extent with private and individual concerns[40], the head of the"
foetus by a natural association stands for the ruler or occasionally for
"the owner of the mother lamb. One head to the double foetus, therefore,"
indicates unity--a single rule--whereas two heads point to disruption of
some kind. If the double foetus is so entwined as to be shut in within an
"enclosure, a similarly natural association of ideas would lead to the"
"country being shut in, in a state of confusion, the land in a condition of"
"subjugation or the like. On the other hand, if merely the heads are"
enclosed so as to give the impression of unity and the rest of the two
"bodies is disentangled, the unfavorable sign is converted into a favorable"
one. A second principle involved in the interpretation results in a more
"favorable conclusion if the double foetus shows less complications. So, a"
single neck or a single spine or a single breast or a single mouth point
"again, like a single head, towards unity and therefore to flourishing"
"conditions in the land. In the case of legs and tails, to be sure, the"
carbonate of lime of the Algonkian limestones and marbles was
"extracted from sea water by organisms, as is done at present by"
"corals, mollusks, and other humble animals and plants, the life of"
"those ancient seas must have been abundant. Graphite, a soft black"
mineral composed of carbon and used in the manufacture of lead
"pencils and as a lubricant, occurs widely in the metamorphic pre-"
Cambrian rocks. It is known to be produced in some cases by the
"metamorphism of coal, which itself is formed of decomposed vegetal"
tissues. Seams of graphite may therefore represent accumulations
"of vegetal matter such as seaweed. But limestone, iron ores, and"
"graphite can be produced by chemical processes, and their presence"
"in the pre-Cambrian makes it only probable, and not certain, that"
life existed at that time.
PRE-CAMBRIAN FOSSILS. Very rarely has any clear trace of an
organism been found in the most ancient chapters of the geological
"record, so many of their leaves have been destroyed and so far"
have their pages been defaced. Omitting structures whose organic
"nature has been questioned, there are left to mention a tiny"
"seashell of one of the most lowly types,--a DISCINA from the pre-"
"Cambrian rocks of the Colorado Canyon,--and from the pre-Cambrian"
rocks of Montana trails of annelid worms and casts of their
"burrows in ancient beaches, and fragments of the tests of"
crustaceans. These diverse forms indicate that before the
"Algonkian had closed, life was abundant and had widely"
differentiated. We may expect that other forms will be discovered
as the rocks are closely searched.
PRE-CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. Our knowledge is far too meager to warrant
an attempt to draw the varying outlines of sea and land during the
Archean and Algonkian eras. Pre-Cambrian time probably was longer
"than all later geological time down to the present, as we may"
"nature worship, and could never be completely disguised by means of mystic"
interpretations. Never was the lack of harmony greater between the
moralizing tendencies of theologians and the cruel shamelessness of
tradition. A god held up as the august lord of the universe was the pitiful
"and abject hero of an obscene love affair; the taurobolium, performed to"
satisfy man's most exalted aspirations for spiritual purification and
"immortality, looked like a {72} shower bath of blood and recalled"
cannibalistic orgies. The men of letters and senators attending those
"mysteries saw them performed by painted eunuchs, ill reputed for their"
"infamous morals, who went through dizzy dances similar to those of the"
dancing dervishes and the Aissaouas. We can imagine the repugnance these
ceremonies caused in everybody whose judgment had not been destroyed by a
fanatical devotion. Of no other pagan superstition do the Christian
"polemicists speak with such profound contempt, and there is undoubtedly a"
reason for their attitude. But they were in a more fortunate position than
their pagan antagonists; their doctrine was not burdened with barbarous
traditions dating back to times of savagery; and all the ignominies that
stained the old Phrygian religion must not prejudice us against it nor
cause us to slight the long continued efforts that were made to refine it
gradually and to mould it into a form that would fulfil the new demands of
morality and enable it to follow the laborious march of Roman society on
the road of religious progress.

EGYPT.
We know more about the religion of the early Egyptians than about any other
ancient religion. Its development can be traced back three or four thousand
"eclipses them."" The Revolution was evidently gaining completer hold"
"over his mind and was somewhat blurring his insular sentiments, when a"
rebuff from Paoli further weakened his ties to Corsica. Buonaparte had
"dedicated to him his work on Corsica, and had sent him the manuscript"
"for his approval. After keeping it an unconscionable time, the old man"
now coldly replied that he did not desire the honour of Buonaparte's
"panegyric, though he thanked him heartily for it; that the"
consciousness of having done his duty sufficed for him in his old age;
"and, for the rest, history should not be written in youth. A further"
request from Joseph Buonaparte for the return of the slighted
"manuscript brought the answer that he, Paoli, had no time to search"
"his papers. After this, how could hero-worship subsist?"
"The four months spent by Buonaparte at Auxonne were, indeed, a time of"
disappointment and hardship. Out of his slender funds he paid for the
"education of his younger brother, Louis, who shared his otherwise"
"desolate lodging. A room almost bare but for a curtainless bed, a"
"table heaped with books and papers, and two chairs--such were the"
surroundings of the lieutenant in the spring of 1791. He lived on
"bread that he might rear his brother for the army, and that he might"
"buy books, overjoyed when his savings mounted to the price of some"
coveted volume.
Perhaps the depressing conditions of his life at Auxonne may account
for the acrid tone of an essay which he there wrote in competition for
"a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons on the subject--""What truths"
"and sentiments ought to be inculcated to men for their happiness."" It"
was unsuccessful; and modern readers will agree with the verdict of
one of the judges that it was incongruous in arrangement and of a bad
"and ragged style. The thoughts are set forth in jerky, vehement"
"clauses; and, in place of the _sensibilité_ of some of his earlier"
"effusions, we feel here the icy breath of materialism. He regards an"
which has a genuine religious motive often fails. Most of the great
"artists in fiction, when they have taken in hand a subject which is of"
"religious interest, have written in a spirit of detachment. George"
"Eliot’s _Romola_ is an example, and the result is that men are more"
interested in Tito Melema than in Savonarola. Novels in which religion
is necessarily much in evidence have been written either by literary
artists who have studiously endeavoured to lay aside their own
"personal convictions, or if the books have been written with a"
distinctly religious purpose the hero and heroine have been
"unconvincing, the people in the story have not been alive."
When Cardinal Newman had abandoned prematurely his hope of maintaining
"the Catholic character of the Church of England, he did not disdain to"
employ his pen in the production of a novel with a religious purpose;
but we are amazed to find that the exquisite grace of style which is
one of the charms of the _Apologia_ could not render Charles Riding
"interesting, or the novel _Loss and Gain_, of which he is the hero,"
readable.
It is perhaps dangerous to give another example from contemporary
"fiction, but those who justly admire Mrs. Humphry Ward’s subtle"
discernment of character and great and increasing mastery of form and
"style, will not be inclined to dispute the opinion that when, in"
"_Robert Elsmere_, she undertook the defence of the modern Unitarian"
"position, her hero was hardly a “Man’s man.”"
The reason is not far to seek. The average man knows too much of the
darker side of life; and the necessary effort made by the author of
"religious novels to depict that of which they, fortunately for their"
"own souls, have had no experience, is not successful. Charles"
Kingsley’s undergraduate days were perhaps not without knowledge of
"the shadows, but he is happier in the Schools of Alexandria, or in the"
and to wonder into what manner of company he had thrust himself.  He had
"never before been inside this house, though he had, in the first days of"
"his new career, taken his meals in some of the numerous coffee or"
"chocolate houses, or the taverns which abounded throughout the town."
"Latterly he had generally bought his food at the cheapest market, and"
had eaten it in the attic to which he had removed himself and his few
belongings.  He was beginning to wonder how long he should be able even
to retain that humble abode as his own.  Dame Fortune’s smiles seemed
"quite to have deserted him, and abject poverty stared him grimly in the"
face.
"A smoking lamp had been brought in, and hung overhead, lighting up the"
faces of the company with its yellow glare.  There was something strange
and Rembrandt-like in the effect of the picture upon which Grey’s eyes
"rested.  Leaning back dreamily with his head against the wall, he could"
"almost fancy himself back in one of those foreign picture galleries, in"
"which heretofore he had delighted, and where so many hours of his time"
had been spent.
"But this was a living picture, shifting, changing, breaking up into"
"groups and re-forming again; and the hum of talk went on unceasingly, as"
"one after another took up the word and launched forth his opinions,"
"generally in florid and flowery language, and with much gesticulation"
and indignation.
What first struck Grey as strange was the anger which seemed to possess
all these men.  That they were in no good case was well-nigh proved by
"the shabbiness of their dress, and by the fact of their being gathered"
"in this very humble and cheap place of resort, which would not tempt any"

PREFACE:
BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.
AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as
"“unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli"
"about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a"
particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau
"d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with"
"which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then,"
"in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of"
"which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat"
"deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern"
"itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my"
"critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and"
"thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively"
"noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I"
"quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I"
"have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to"
"go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and"
to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a
work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf
of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
"delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between"
"this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and"
"timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once"
"emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince"
"yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two"
standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by
"its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured"
entirely by its art.
to say: it is a question of the stage of development.
"Experience has taught me that for the group of normal children, almost"
"irrespective of age, the first kind of story suitable will contain an"
appeal to conditions to which they are accustomed. The reason of this
"is obvious: the child, having limited experience, can only be reached"
"by this experience, until his imagination is awakened and he is enabled"
to grasp through this faculty what he has not actually passed through.
Before this awakening has taken place he enters the realm of fiction
(represented in the story) by comparison with his personal experience.
Every story and every point in the story mean more as that experience
"widens, and the interest varies, of course, with temperament, quickness"
"of perception, power of visualising and of concentration."
"In “The Marsh King's Daughter,” H. C. Andersen says:"
“The Storks have a great many stories which they tell their little
"ones, all about the bogs and marshes. They suit them to their age and"
"capacity. The young ones are quite satisfied with Kribble, Krabble,"
"or some such nonsense, and find it charming; but the elder ones want"
something with more meaning.”
One of the most interesting experiments to be made in connection with
this subject is to tell the same story at intervals of a year or six
months to some individual child.[25] The different incidents in the
"story which appeal to it (and you must watch it closely, to be sure the"
"interest is real, and not artificially stimulated by any suggestion on"
your part) will mark its mental development and the gradual awakening
"of its imagination. This experiment is a very delicate one, and will"
"not be infallible, because children are secretive and the appreciation"
"is often (unconsciously) simulated, or concealed through shyness or"
"want of articulation. But it is, in spite of this, a deeply interesting"
reaction of these various weak solutions upon one another and upon
the walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of vein stuffs and
ores.
As an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the
"case of a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines, Nevada, to"
"carry the hot water of the mine from one level to another, which"
in ten years was lined with calcium carbonate more than half an
inch thick.
"The Steamboat Springs, Nevada, furnish examples of mineral veins"
in process of formation. The steaming water rises through fissures
in volcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone
"of quartz, with metallic ores of iron, mercury, lead, and other"
metals.
RECONCENTRATION. Near the base of the zone of solution veins are
often stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits.
This local enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of
its metalliferous ores. As the surface of the land is slowly
"lowered by weathering and running water, the zone of solution is"
lowered at an equal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of
cementation. The minerals of veins are therefore constantly being
dissolved along their upper portions and carried down the fissures
"by ground water to lower levels, where they are redeposited."
Many of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive
concentrations: the ores were leached originally from the rocks to
a large extent by laterally seeping waters; they were concentrated
in the ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents;
they have been reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just
mentioned.
"moderate severity, and which recovered spontaneously."
The whole crux in diagnosis lay in the attempt to separate the two
"latter classes, and, personally, I must own to having been no nearer a"
"position of being able to form an opinion on this point, in the late"
than in the early stage of my stay in South Africa. The advent of
peritoneal septicæmia was in many instances the only determining moment.
"On this matter I can only add that, in civil practice, an exploratory"
abdominal section is often the only means of determination of a rupture
of the bowel wall.
With regard to the cases of suspected injury to the bowel which
"recovered spontaneously, the symptoms were somewhat special in their"
"comparative slightness, and in the limited nature of the local signs."
"Thus the pulse seldom rose to as much as 100 in rate, 80 was a common"
"average. Respiration was never greatly quickened, 24 was a common rate."
"The temperature rarely exceeded 100°. Vomiting was occasionally severe,"
"but usually not persistent, ceasing on the second day. A good quantity"
"of urine was passed. As to the local signs, these again were of a"
"limited nature; distension did not occur, or was slight; movement of the"
"abdominal wall was only restricted in the neighbourhood of the wound,"
"the affected area amounted to a quarter, or at most half, the abdominal"
"wall, and rigidity was localised to a similar segment. Local tenderness"
"usually existed; but, as a rule, there was little or no dulness to point"
to the occurrence either of fluid effusion or a considerable deposition
of lymph.
Again many of the patients suffered with very slight symptoms of
"constitutional shock, although there was considerable variation in this"
particular.
"(165*) Wounded at Graspan, sustaining a compound fracture of"
There was a very definite purpose in this somewhat rustically cunning
"and half ironical letter. Luther wanted, if possible, to make Erasmus"
"show his colours, to win him, the powerful authority, touchstone of"
"science and culture, for the cause which he advocated. In his heart"
Luther had long been aware of the deep gulf separating him from Erasmus.
"As early as March 1517, six months before his public appearance, he"
wrote about Erasmus to John Lang: 'human matters weigh heavier with him
"than divine,' an opinion that so many have pronounced about"
"Erasmus--obvious, and yet unfair."
"The attempt, on the part of Luther, to effect a _rapprochement_ was a"
reason for Erasmus to retire at once. Now began that extremely ambiguous
policy of Erasmus to preserve peace by his authority as a light of the
world and to steer a middle course without committing himself. In that
attitude the great and the petty side of his personality are
inextricably intertwined. The error because of which most historians
have seen Erasmus's attitude towards the Reformation either in far too
unfavourable a light or--as for instance the German historian
"Kalkoff--much too heroic and far-seeing, is that they erroneously regard"
him as psychologically homogeneous. Just that he is not. His
double-sidedness roots in the depths of his being. Many of his
utterances during the struggle proceed directly from his fear and lack
"of character, also from his inveterate dislike of siding with a person"
or a cause; but behind that is always his deep and fervent conviction
that neither of the conflicting opinions can completely express the
"truth, that human hatred and purblindness infatuate men's minds. And"
with that conviction is allied the noble illusion that it might yet be
"possible to preserve the peace by moderation, insight, and kindliness."
In April 1519 Erasmus addressed himself by letter to the elector
"Frederick of Saxony, Luther's patron. He begins by alluding to his"
his must necessarily be in direct and absolute opposition! At the same
"time, he remembered that those who were sure of their faith never lost"
"their temper about it,--and as he glanced at his friend's perfectly"
"serene and coldly smiling countenance, he saw there was no danger of"
"his letting slip, even for a moment, his admirable power of"
"self-command. The Duc de la Santoisie, meanwhile, settling his"
"mustache, and gracefully waving one hand, on which sparkled a large"
"diamond ring, bent forward a little with a courteous, deprecatory"
gesture.
"""I think""--he said, in soft, purring accents,--""that my friend, Dr."
"Mudley""--here he bowed toward the saturnine looking individual who had"
"entered into conversation with Alwyn--""takes a very proper, and indeed"
"a very lofty, view of the whole question. The moral sense""--and he laid"
"a severely weighty emphasis on these words,--""the moral sense of each"
"man, if properly trained, is quite sufficient to guide him through"
"existence, without any such weakness as reliance on a merely"
"supposititious Deity."""
The Duke's French way of speaking English was charming; he gave an
"expressive roll to his r's, especially when he said ""the moral sense,"""
that of itself almost carried conviction. His wife smiled as she heard
"him, and her smile was not altogether pleasant. Perhaps she wondered by"
"what criterion of excellence he measured his own ""moral sense,"" or"
"whether, despite his education and culture, he had any ""moral sense"" at"
"all, higher than that of the pig, who eats to be eaten! But Alwyn"
"spoke, and she listened intently, finding a singular fascination in the"
"soft and quiet modulation of his voice, which gave a vaguely delicious"
suggestion of music underlying speech.
"""To guide people by their moral sense alone""--he said--""you must first"
"prove plainly to them that the moral sense exists, together with moral"
This same lady was always terribly distressed when she had to order a
"fowl to be killed for her husband's breakfast, even if she had never"
"seen it before. I have seen her, after telling the cook to kill a fowl"
"for breakfast, run away and sit down in the veranda with her hands over"
"her ears, and her face the very picture of misery, fearing lest she"
should hear its shrieks. I think that this was the one great trouble to
"her in her marriage, that her husband would insist on eating fowls and"
"ducks, and that she had to order them to be killed."
"As she is, so are most Burmans. If there is all this trouble about"
"fowls, it can be imagined how the trouble increases when it comes to"
goats or any larger beasts. In the jungle villages meat of any kind at
all is never seen: no animals of any kind are allowed to be killed. An
officer travelling in the district would be reduced to what he could
"carry with him, if it were not for an Act of Government obliging"
"villages to furnish--on payment, of course--supplies for officers and"
troops passing through. The mere fact of such a law being necessary is
sufficient proof of the strength of the feeling against taking life.
"Of course, all shooting, either for sport or for food, is looked upon as"
disgraceful. In many jungle villages where deer abound there are one or
two hunters who make a living by hunting. But they are disgraced men.
"They are worse than fishermen, and they will have a terrible penalty to"
pay for it all. It will take much suffering to wash from their souls the
"cruelty, the blood-thirstiness, the carelessness to suffering, the"
"absence of compassion, that hunting must produce. 'Is there no food in"
"the bazaar, that you must go and take the lives of animals?' has been"
"said to me many a time. And when my house-roof was infested by sparrows,"
"who dropped grass and eggs all over my rooms, so that I was obliged to"
"shoot them with a little rifle, this was no excuse. 'You should have"
"built a sparrow-cote,' they told me. 'If you had built a sparrow-cote,"
they would have gone away and left you in peace. They only wanted to
lady and the baby and the cart emerged from the hotel door they were
"attended by an ever-increasing throng of unwashed Venetians, whose"
interest could not have been keener had Santos Dumont's air-ship or a
"Japanese jinriksha suddenly appeared in their gondola-ridden town, and"
who commented in shrill Italian on this wheeled apparition. The lady is
"not easily beaten when she decides to do anything, but, after standing"
"that for half a block or so, she made a hasty retreat to the hotel, and"
"wheels disappeared, probably forever, from the streets of Venice."
[Sidenote: Gondolas and Gondoliers.]
"Although Venice, with its population of one hundred and sixty-three"
"thousand, is seven miles in circumference, and is divided by one"
"hundred and forty-six canals into one hundred and seventeen islands,"
yet these are so joined together by means of four hundred bridges that
it is possible to walk all over the city. But the bridges are built in
"steps, and cannot be used by wheeled vehicles. There are no horses or"
"carriages of any kind. The funereal-looking gondola, always painted"
"black, is the only conveyance upon these streets of water, and does"
"duty for cab, omnibus, wagon, cart, wheelbarrow and hearse. It is used"
"for pleasure riding, shopping, church-going, theatre-going, visiting,"
"carrying prisoners to jail, carrying the dead to the cemetery--in"
"short, for everything."
"In propelling this black but graceful and easy-going boat, the"
"gondolier does not sit. He stands, on a sort of deck platform towards"
"the stern, and to balance his weight there is affixed to the prow a"
"heavy piece of shining steel, which rears itself at the front almost"
"like a figure-head, only this is always of the same pattern, simply"
"a broad, upright blade of steel, notched deeply on the front edge."
"The gondolier does not pull the oar, he pushes it--there is only one"
"oar--and he does not change it from side to side, as in paddling a"
cephalopods take a new departure. So far in all their various
"forms, whether straight, as the Orthoceras, or curved, or close-"
"coiled as in the nautilus, the septum, or partition dividing the"
"chambers, met the inner shell along a simple line, like that of"
the rim of a saucer. There now begins a growth of the septum by
"which its edges become sharply corrugated, and the suture, or line"
"of juncture of the septum and the shell, is thus angled. The group"
in which this growth of the septum takes place is called the
"GONIATITE (Greek GONIA, angle)."
VERTEBRATES. It is with the greatest interest that we turn now to
study the backboned animals of the Devonian; for they are believed
to be the ancestors of the hosts of vertebrates which have since
dominated the earth. Their rudimentary structures foreshadowed
"what their descendants were to be, and give some clue to the"
earliest vertebrates from which they sprang. Like those whose
"remains are found in the lower Paleozoic systems, all of these"
Devonian vertebrates were aquatic and go under the general
designation of fishes.
"The lowest in grade and nearest, perhaps, to the ancestral type of"
"vertebrates, was the problematic creature, an inch or so long, of"
"Figure 297. Note the circular mouth not supplied with jaws, the"
"lack of paired fins, and the symmetric tail fin, with the column"
"of cartilaginous, ringlike vertebrae running through it to the"
end. The animal is probably to be placed with the jawless lampreys
"and hags,--a group too low to be included among true fishes."
"OSTRACODERMS. This archaic group, long since extinct, is also too"
"lowly to rank among the true fishes, for its members have neither"
"jaws nor paired fins. These small, fishlike forms were cased in"

Silent sculptures are looking at us.
They can only speak through their shape.
"And what we can read from their language, we'll be forever our property."
This works of art must have been made by an artist working in turbulent 20th century.
He expressed the tragedy and dignity of a man of our times.
His name is Xawery Dunikowski.
"Sculptor, painter, educator, builder of the People's Republic of Poland."
"During 60 years of his career, hands of the artist knew no rest searching forms for ideas that were always original and full of humanism."
In 1955 we were celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of creative work.
"So much work, so many battles with recalcitrant matter."
So many works of art.
Let's go between the sculptures.

"He knows something, inform me of all his movements, understood?"
Yes sir.
Go ahead.
"Well, very well."
"I see you have learned quickly, Adriana."
"Thank you, Madame."
"Remember no to think of what has happened, it was horrible, but it has passed."
"We cannot do anything for her now, let this be a lesson."
"Surely,it was one of those, crimes of passion."
"Go change, we must see the next designs."
"Good morning, Madame Rapee."
"Look, I admit no one to interrupt my work."
"So, if you are here to see your friend, it is best for you to leave, and dont come here again."
Allez!
"I am sorry, I do not know what friend you are talking about?"
She is talking about me.
"Ah, I see you got a job, I am glad."
"Yes, but not for long, If you do not leave immediatedly!"
"Ok, Madame, In reality, the only thing I wanted, was to interview the models."
"Are you une, police?"
Not exactly...
"They have undergone all kinds of questioning,"
"And I do not want the girls to be nervous with what happened, so leave!"
"In that case, please forgive me, I will bother you no more, Excuse me."
"Ok girls, lets go."

That's interesting.
Why would Blake Carrington want you to see a doctor?
"For a very obvious reason, Joel."
I've been playing that I have a headache so I won't have to perform my wifely duties.
So he doesn't realise I'm not his darling Krystle.
"He's sick and tired of your headache, sleeping alone and feeling lonely."
Exactly.
"Rita, why don't you go to the doctor?"
All you have to do is pretend to take whatever pills he gives you.
It's like back problems.
You can't prove a headache.
"Well, suppose he wants me to take a blood test and mine doesn't match your aunt's, then what?"
Then nothing.
Her blood will match perfectly.
"I should know, I'm her doctor."

This is perfect.
Don't you see?
Either one of you?
"What are you talking about, Joel?"
I've just cast myself.
I'm going to be playing Krystle Carrington's good doctor.
This is the chance I've been waiting for.
My chance to get into the house.
What better way than to be a specialist she's asked for on the advice of a friend.
Because I didn't think anybody would be here!
I thought that Jabbar and his men would be trying -- trying to kill me!
"Look, I have millions invested in here!"
I was just trying to salvage something!
"I thought they were gone, and then a couple of guys came back."
How many?
How many guys?
Three?
Five?
I don't know!
Just get down here!
"That doesn't sound good, Sam."
I know.
"When planning an escape, patience is key."
"Someone without training might jump at the first chance to strike, but that's exactly the wrong time, because that's when your enemy's most alert."
"In fact, the best time to make your move is after you've let plenty of other opportunities go by."
The other advantage of patience is it gives you a chance to find out if the situation has changed.
What happened?
"We were on our way to his house, and my -- my men called."
He snuck into his warehouse.
"He was hiding in his office, crying like a woman."
We got the pig.
Now you'll get to see him bleed.

It's been 10 months since you helped my whore of a wife run away from me.
10 months.
Now I think...
My waiting is done.
"Look, I-I don't -"

That's a lie.

Are these the same X-rays?
"Jefferson, Jefferson Reed."
"Mary, would you give me the blood vial on this patient?"
"""Jefferson Reed."""
The patient's name is Jefferson Reed.
"Dr. Jones, you're needed immediately... in patient Jefferson Reed's room."
Cut the bandages away.
"Oh, my God."
Let me have a mirror.
This is how I always look.
What we have here is another case... of a patient being diagnosed improperly.
He was suffering from third-degree burns... but there isn't any scar tissue anywhere.
Any real doctor might assume that this is... a rare case of the Stromburg theory... where badly burned tissue has an adverse reaction... causing the tissue to heal.
- Wrong!
Wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
Wrong.
"The Stromburg theory states... that minor burns could heal under stress, not third-degree."
"Look in the book... page 294, 3rd paragraph, middle of the page."
- He's right.
- Thank you.
Dr. Jones wrong.
He don't know what he talkin' about.
You really should reread chapter fourteen.
Chapter fourteen?
"Please, tell us why."
"In chapter fourteen, he starts out talking about..."
What was I saying again?
"Thank you very much for your medical tips, Mr. Reed."
I just want to run a few more tests... and you may leave whenever you're ready.

- Positive.
"The wire came from Honolulu, and she's the only Diane I've ever known."
Did she ask for money?
Diane would never do that.
Things were different between us.
She was different.
Special.
We were married.
I don't care how long ago it's been.
Diane would never blackmail me.
"I don't understand the problem, sir."
Why don't you call the president and accept the nomination?
I don't dare take the chance.

"Well, I'd like to introduce you to everybody."
"So, what did you think of Mr. Austin Howard, then?"
Um...
Marks out of ten?
An 11.
Really?
G.B.'s only an eight.
"I was going to say 12, actually."
Twelve?
There you go.
"Miss Victoria, 12."
Twelve?
Damn.
Gangs only take over because you let them.
"If you would've challenged them, they'd think twice."
"You know they got us living like animals... with bars on every window, alarms on every car."
"All I'm saying is, if we would just patrol our streets... like right here at Drake's Place... where all the drugs are... and with everybody wearing one of these hats."
"Show them those hats, Maxine."
If everybody wore one of these caps... they'd know that we meant business.
- Ma.
- Don't you have a show to do?
He needs money again.
Your brother Kenny never asks for anything.
Dad!
How much?
I just need ten dollars for gas.
"You know, you should be coming to some of these meetings."
"This is your community, too."
You listen to what Mrs. Walker's talking about.
That's right.
This whistle will be a signal to everybody who hears it... to call the police.
You crazy if you think...
I'm going to walk up some dark alley... with a loud orange hat on my head and a whistle.
I can see the headlines now...
"""Golden Lords kill old man in loud orange hat..."
"""and stuff a whistle up his butt."""
Ernest is right.
This patrol is a dumb idea.
"Oh, Elvira!"
No.
It's time we stuck together.
"Mom, Dad, I got to go to the show... but she's right."
We can't win.
Don't upset your father.
It's not just that worrying you.
You can't stop thinking about that portrait of your family.
It won't get out of my head.
Just yesterday I was posing with my family.
My mother scolded me because I wouldn't sit still.
"When we finish the mission, we'll find out what happened to your family."
"I don't know if I want to find out, Julián."
There it is.
A new mission awaits us.
Victory or death.
I prefer the first one.
Me too.
You two go and see the Prior.
And you?
I'll start looking.
With this habit no one will suspect anything.
Be careful.
And to what do we owe your visit?
There is a risk of imminent attack by the Maquis.
I doubt it.
We are peaceful people.
and because of that have always been respected.
A big fish in the German army is coming to visit this monastery.
We need to be sure that nothing happens to him.
"Do what you wish, but do not bother the brothers."
You've arrived just at lunch time.
(Door creaking open)
(Two shots)
Throw down your weapons!
"Look, how thoughtful."
This one doesn't need subtitles.
I said to throw down your weapons.
"They tell me you've broken the code, Dr. Sengupta."
Yes.
The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby correspond to the locations of his bombs.
"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,"
"""Beard"" for beard beach, and ""Grace..."""

Genius.
There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco Police Department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.
Lives will be saved.
Alcatraz proving itself to be once again the crown jewel of American penal sciences.
"Milton, don't skulk out there like a common ferret."
It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague.
Genius.
Doctor.
I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes, but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice, my Don't overstep."
"Rebecca, there he is."
Walk me to him.
"Doc, stay here."
Call Tanner.
You got it.
Could we please just turn those lights down a little?
You need them for the public-access cameras.
I know.
It's unfortunate.
Nobody looks good in high def.
"You know, if you would like to address this council as a citizen, you can go ahead and wait at..."
Could you stop with the fucking spotlight?
"Celia, check the language at the door."
Families are watching.
"You know, I know what you're trying to do."
"I know what you're all trying to do, and it's not gonna work."
I don't need you to like me.
How about we put this to a vote?
"All those who don't like Celia, say ""aye."""
Aye.
The public has spoken.
Damn it!
"- Saturday's Dad's birthday, you know."
- I know.
"Well, we have a lot to do to get ready."
Maybe we'll scale down on the party a little this year.
- Last year was kind of a lot.
- What did you guys do last year?
"Ate his favorite food, watched his favorite movies, and beat the shit out of a piñata."
That's right.
He always did have a thing for piñatas.
"- Did he ever hit you, Nancy?"
- I'm not filled with candy.
"So, what's the plan?"
"We'll do something, maybe just not the full-on, all-day celebration."
Why can't we just do what we did last year?
I'm not sure I can handle it.
It's ugly.
It's loud.
It's always moving.
I never feel still long enough to hold a thought.
I feel sick out there among the people.
"I need to remedy this, and an opportunity has presented itself."
I'm gonna take it.
I've got no money and no hope of another advance.
I'm doing what's best for me.
"Yeah, you're doing what you're best at."
You're looking out for your own self interests without thinking about how it might affect me or anybody else.
Typical!
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.
"Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice that I'm alone all of a sudden."
Why can't you do something that involves me?
Why can't we go somewhere together?
"You know, alone or..."
Is it the money?
Because I don't mind if you need to borrow some again...
"Put your money away, all right?"
I'm not taking any money from you.
Those days are behind me.
"Forever, I told myself."
I hope this will be good for us.
But especially for me.
You are selfish and unsentimental.
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
On the contrary.
"An admirable trait, if you ask me."
I come from an unsupportive background.
Forgive me of holding you up.
What has happened to you?
I was collecting the mail.
"Dear Mr. Brass, I am Rosella and I saw some of the films,... not in the cinema, but in the tapes, which Gianni my husband,... brings home and which we watch together."
"I am 33 years old and think of myself as as a normal woman,... far faway from damsels and their works."
"However, something incredible happened to me, which seems... impossible of having occured."
Perhaps that's why...
I write.
"I was angry with my husband, because he would stay... at work at the clinic at night and not... take me out for dinner as agreed."
I had my outing organised.
I took the children to... mama and did not prepare dinner.
You could have told me before.
"Sorry, it is not my fault."
"We are going out to dinner another day,... besides, I am tired."
-It's always the same!
First the rest and finally your wife.
"-Not so, I apologised."
-You are a specialist at that.
Thus you never bring it on.
You only care for yourself.
Everything must turn around you and get done your way.
The others do not count.
"For you I am just a housewife,... and your maid."
"Enough, Rosella."
I visited the sick all day long.
I am tired.
And you create problems over nothing.
Stop being so hysterical.
Bye!
I cannot say any more in here.
Talk to me at home.
When you have calmed down.
All right.
"So why did Cleveland drop the ""a"" from its name?"
"Well, the masthead for the newspaper?"
Mm-hmm?
"They figured out that it was, like, not long enough..."
"Well, we're not bffs yet, but he did promise to text me at least once a week."
"Thank you, joy."
"Oh, hey, how did the foundation fundraiser go?"
Utterly exhausting.
But it'll be worth it just to see the smile on my face... when I win that emmy.
"And, of course, announce my miraculous recovery."
Yes.
You know what?
"You know, I feel like I really did a good thing."
"You know, which gives one a certain glow, a little something extra."
I'll say.
I notice even now a few people looking my way.
"In fact, quite a few people, like..."
"I'm still wearing the goiter, aren't I?"
"Oh, I bet it feels good to get rid of that thing, doesn't it?"
"Oh, it really does."
I was talking to the goiter.

"I was saying, our case is one of mythomania."
The word comes from the Greek:
"mitos, myth, mania, mania."
"It's formed in the psyche, in the subconscious, a sort of gap."
"It lowers, it lowers blinds that.."
Blocks the memory.
"- No, not exactly."
It lowers the blinds..
"yeah, fine, that blocks the memory."
"Excuse me, Sir, did you see that guy?"
Can it really be him?
"That's not a man but a gnome, a runt!"
"- Papa, what do you know, excuse me?"
"It's a question of the subconscious, as the counselor rightly said."
It all depends on the fact that if it lowers we call it blinds.
We all have our blinds.
"Oh, perfect!"
"You have believed in good faith, and we'll support you with our doctrine that he was the other."
In these long years of solitude you created from reality a totally ideal image that matched the other.
"Don't worry, ma'am, I'll take care of you."
Thank you.
"Sir, excuse me, what about Mario?"
"Mario, who is Mario?"
- What do you mean?
"Mario De Santis, her husband."
- No.
I know he was dead.
"You bastard,you killed him!"

Handcuff him and get a sworn statement.
I hope you fry!
Go to hell Go to hell.
Wow.
"I got to come up here more often gibbs,I screwed up."
"Well,yeah."
You almost spilled my coffee.
"When tony and i ran out to pick up jody, I left finn's bag of gold on my desk."
Mm-hmm.
"I know I should've taken to evidence, but we were focusing on... here's the inveory."
You took it to evidence.
"It says re the bag contained $18,000 worth of gold."
"We are $60,000 short."
You gave siri and rebecca back the money they loaned finn.
I thought I'd save the courts some paperwork.
You wouldn't be getting soft?
Of course not.
You shaved your moustache.
"Uh,boss,reception called this morning, they said that seone was here with information about sorry about a case."
"I went to meet her,and,um,this is jessica coleman,james finn's fiancee. ncis Season 4 Episode 5"
It's a great neighborhood.
"Very quiet, very private."
"There's an oversized backyard, that's a big plus."
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.
"Stainless appliances, air purification system, total move-in condition."
"The furniture is rented, but if you like it,I can have the company make you a deal."
Until hit means you're alive!
We know the hiding place of Mickey.
It is an hour that we feel the stench.
"Understand, understand."
"Excuse me now, first and after."
I did not know how to reach you.
"Before the fuse burning, you were gone."
I remember.
I tried.
"LeBaron has found hanging in your window and thanks to a photo of your cousin on ""him"", take him to the apartment in the face that I had to empty."
"- It's the most, have not understood anything!"
- And Mickey?
You have done?
I destroy everything I love.
"We repeat, chin."
"Watch the Venini, it's not destroyed at all."
"Indeed, you know that was a lover of my mother?"
He discovered that the love had no money for this animal.
He was a thug that proved that he did not have the means to offer what he thought it could throw away.
"And now, no longer, does not want more, do not know."
"Thank you, I do."
Here is the soup my first Venini mistreated.
Mickey has shaken the tree
Matalon and the bad the gate waiting to ...
"If you are a man, don't continue lying there."
He is the man under discussion now.
"A dirty affair between men, of honor, of power."
Complaints?
Complaining about my mother?
I listen to my tears ...
Want to taste my love?
Love makes miracles.
"Well, he's coming to work with me, so I guess that's the plan, if that's still the plan."
Up to you.
There are a few things around here that need repairing.
"All right, kids, go get your things for school."
I'll be at the car.
- Michael.
- I call front seat!
Come on!
"My turn, Jared!"
You got it yesterday!
"Now, you're released into my custody until this case is solved, Michael, so if I let you stay, you do understand you can't leave."
"Yeah, of course, I'll do whatever you want."
That's the least I owe you.
"And, listen, I'm, uh,"
I'm sorry again for putting you through this.
"After today, this is all behind us and you can get back to focusing on your repair shop."
You find a space?
Got a few I'm looking at.
"I'm gonna pay you back every dime, you know-- with interest."
And free repairs for life.
"Hey, tell your man Gibbs I'll miss him."
You lay off Special Agent Gibbs.
This hasn't been easy on him either.
"Eh, I don't like the way he looks at me."
He looks at everybody like that.
"Where is he, Leon?"
"According to my morning brief, you recovered a knife from the suspect."
It came back negative;
it's not our weapon.
Then what next?
Could Michael be a flight risk?
He's at my house with his sister.
"And I thought, ""Well, this won't go well, I probably shouldn't."""
"But I thought, ""Well, what would my mother say?"""
LAUGHTER
"I thought, ""Well, she'd say, 'Yes'"", so I said, ""Yes"", and I snorted this not overgenerous line, and I realised, as soon as I'd done this,"
"that this wasn't cocaine, as we know it."
"It was burning at the back of my nose, and I said to this man, ""What was that?"""
"He said, ""Oh, it's crystal meth,"""
and crystal meth...
Phone your mum.
LAUGHTER
"I mean, it makes you very, shall we say, uninhibited."
And I realised I'd been groomed by this man.
"He'd sent his friend along, cos then he was able to approach me."
They were working in tandem?
I was more receptive.
And I went off with this man...
and I'll just jump ahead three days.
LAUGHTER
Please don't.
"No, you don't want to know."
"Oh, we do."
I came too in a multistorey car park in Harlem.
"Oh, what bad luck, Julian."
"Well, there's a..."
You know...
LAUGHTER
"You go to a club, have some drugs with someone you've never met before and then all hell breaks loose."
It wasn't what I was expecting.
Were you in a car?
"I was near, shall we say, an open boot."
Were you?
"But, there's a sequel to this."
Come to the window
"All those windows out there, I'm behind one of them"
What do you want?
I've had it I'm getting out
"Don't leave me, Elizabeth"
Where are you going?
Somewhere you'll never find me
I'll find you I don't give up
"Sweet dreams, Elizabeth"
How many?
Two thousand tenants.
Fascinating.
"In addition, we can handle up to 5,000 visitors a day."
That's a lot of people to have over for drinks.
"You have 80 miles of wiring, piping, cables..."
- In this apartment?
"- No, over the whole building."
That's a relief.
There's a restaurant in the foyer which serves what we consider the finest seafood.
We also have a gift shop and a wedding chapel.
- Mother will like that.
"- Oh, Mother wants you married, huh?"
Mother wants herself married.
It's looking pretty good now that she's got this aluminum siding salesman from Toronto.
I think they're going to move here.
She wants to be close to me.
Maybe we can show her one of our two-bedroom apartments.
"Well, I'm afraid not."
I was lying.
No aluminum siding salesman.
No mother.
I've developed this strange sense of humor and it sometimes gets me into trouble.
"You know, I got this one Pseudochromis a pain in the ass fish of all time."
"If I move a piece of coral two inches, he won't eat, he don't socialize."
If I change his food mix a bit he acts like you're a heinous criminal.
- This fish aggravates me so much--
- What's the point?
The point is that someone has to ask themself:
"""Is the fish worth it?"" That's what it comes down to."
"Is it worth the aggravation, his pain in the ass ways?"
You're not a fish.
"You are a person, and you can talk."
I should have expressed myself better.
I should have said:
"""It makes me nervous, you giving me something."""
"And,""I'll get used to it, though."""
"And,""Thank you very much."""
How am I communicating?
Good.
- Who did you go up there with?
- Just some friends.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Yeah.
You asked about Greg today.
- His marriage has problems?
"- Yes, he was asking what it was like to be separated."
"If I was glad, did I do the right thing?"
- What did you say?
- That it was tough.
"That I was unhappy, but if I got a shot at something again I might be able to do something with it."
I've learned a lot too.
"And I know what you mean, feeling like you'd take better advantage if you had another chance."
"Johnny, I'm seeing someone."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Let's go home together.
I have a friend waiting downstairs.
Welcome back Father!
"Well, hello there."
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
But I came to greet you.
How did you know I was going to be here?
"Well, you said in the letter that you'd be coming back on the train with someone from the museum, so I thought you'd be here."
That's pretty smart.
I have some business to attend to.
It won't take long.
Would you like to come along?
We could get something to eat.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
No.
I'm going to meet someone from a textbook publisher.
They want to use something I wrote for a Japanese textbook.
"Keep your elbow up, but keep this shoulder down."
"Father, Numata is really annoying."
Why?
Because he hangs around mother.
Because he's her manager.
"If he says something he shouldn't to mother or Shinako,"
I'm going to challenge him to a duel.
A duel?
That's pretty extreme.
The ruins of our family's old house are overgrown with weeds.
"Mother and Shinako are thinking of putting a dance studio here, right?"
"Yeah, but not if they don't have the money."
"By the way, when I was in Kyoto,"
I saw a camera magazine with Shinako's portrait in it.
Takehara probably took that picture.
"This is Captain Malaparte, our liason with the Italians."

"I hope to be useful to your mission, Coronel Wyatt."
General Cork has briefed me.
"General Cork has directed Captain Malaparte... to help you, Mrs. Wyatt."
"Obviously, you'll have to cooperate with the population... and Malaparte will be very useful."
He has a fabulous villa in Capri.
So what do you do in peace time?
I was far too young to remember.
"He was in Spain before that, and before that, Ethiopia."
He should have gone to the US.
Our Italians are pretty well off.
"You're right, but there were already enough organ players."
"Are you making fun of me, Captain?"
"No, on the contrary, I admire your assurance."
You're everything we're not.
You think so?
Get away from me.
I said leave me alone.
- Don't touch me.
- Keep away!
"- Come on, let's go, come on!"
"- Out, come on, let's go!"
"I'd like to help with your Moroccan troops, General, but I'm afraid I can't."
"But my dear General, this is an unprecedented shame!"
"Incredible, a scandal!"
"My men are, how shall I say, hypersexuall."
"Yes, they were born that way."
"They'll stick it in anything... in a sunflower, to be precise."
A sunflower is enough for them.

Coffee?
No thanks.
That last drink had quite the kick.
Yes.
"Yes, indeed."
"Well, why don't you get dressed and join us outside?"
"Sorry for the, uh, the strip search."
"Trust me, it's nothing personal."
All weapons and recording devices will be returned to you once you leave the island.
"Surely, you'd let a lady have her watch."
"Ah, not when it's housing a G.P.S. Transponder, no."
"Play with me again, and I will have you shot."
You don't know where we are because I don't want you to know.
We have business.
Let's do it.
Time to see the merchandise.
It's about a 5-minute walk.
"Uh, watch out for snakes..."
And each other.
Radar detected a speedboat leaving the ship last night.
"Guys, if bosley's been taken off-board, he could be anywhere."
It's a big ocean out there.
"Charlie, we're hoping you can narrow things down for us."
"Luckily, I can."
I had my contact target the search to a few key nearby islands.
Most of them are owned by the requisite movie stars and corporate titans.
This one is the odd man out.
It belongs to Carlton Finch.
"With a name like that, he's got to be bad news."
"Thank you, sahib."
"- Hello, boy."
"- Hello, mate."
"You're alive, anyway."
What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
"So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter."
"Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop."
Where's the troop?
"There's no troop, and the Guru has us."
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
"I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!"
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame?
They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
"- You didn't tell them, did you?"
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero.
Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?

I said untie him!
"Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!"
"You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you."

No one told me there was a meeting.
No.
We rather tried to keep this under wraps at present.
"It seems that there's someone in this disdain department, who knows there's someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk."
That their engine broke down before they even were out of British waters.
Pity.
Pity all around really.
Your first draft bore it so well.
"Actually, the Starking sisters lied."
What difference does it really make?
God sake!
Of course it makes a difference!
It's not the truth!
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man, who terrified them and... set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
They never got there!
Because their engine failed!
Now that's a truth we won't be telling.
Moral sapping apparently.
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
"We are saying, this is based on a true story."
We don't!
For Christ above man!
You are supposed to be a propagandist.
No.
Nothing odd going on here.
[BEEPING]
Dr. Desmond.
"Tell me, Guardian, what part of no interruptions did you not understand?"
A G-Gnome on Sub-Level 26 reports three intruders.
-Ugh.
Did I miss a perimeter breach alert?
-No.
Then the G-Gnome's confused.
Whatever might occur in our faux lab above ground the real Cadmus is the most secure facility in D.C.
My job to keep it that way.
Fine.
Take a squad.
Might I recommend Guardian leave his G-Gnome behind?
If violence should occur....
-The little guy would be in my way.
-No.
The advantage of instant telepathic communication outweighs other concerns.
I need my G-Gnome with me at all times.
"Okay, I'm officially whelmed."
This is how they hide this massive underground facility from the world .
The real Cadmus isn't on the grid.
It generates its own power with these things.
Must be what they're bred for.
Even the name is a clue.
The Cadmus of myth created a new race by sowing dragon's teeth into the earth.
And this Cadmus creates new life too.
Let's find out why.
They call them Genomorphs.
Look at the stats on these things.
"Super-strength, telepathy, razor claws."
It happens fairly often.
"Well, the good news is, we didn't have to go to the emergency room."
"Yeah, I suppose you're right."
Although part of me was looking forward to all of the excitement.
"And now my personal favorite, Mr. Bunny Rabbit."
(crowd groans)
"Hey, where have you been?"
"Awash in social pressure, but I'm back, and I've got something I'm going to say."
"Well, don't tell the story about the two priests on the golf course, 'cause Dreama already did that."
It got a laugh.
I just want to say that I've learned an important lesson tonight.
I realized that what a person looks like on the outside doesn't matter half as much as what she's like on the inside.
I think this belongs to Sabrina.
Or Allan Carr.
Don't get me wrong.
"I'm all for hygiene and grooming, but thanks to you,"
I'll be keeping it all in perspective.
QUICK:
This is a moment she'll never want to forget.
Say cheese.
"Mrs. Quick, no!"
So there we were receiving our crowns when suddenly Sabrina ballooned out.
She was huge.
"At this time, we think a rogue bee may have been the culprit."
Wow.
I hope she wasn't planning to wear it to the prom.
"Well, I'm sure Sabrina will be fine."
Thanks for bringing her home.
(crickets chirping)
SABRINA:
Is the coast clear?
"Oh, I've learned my lesson."
[ Gasps ] Or when we broke into Tom's house and we locked his girlfriend in the closet?
Wow.
We sound totally insane when you string 'em all together.
You ready for another crazy adventure?
"The crazier, the better!"
- [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ]
"So, like, normally, this is the moment where I would pound my drink and then smash it against the wall, but I'm kind of at a loss here."
- Would these help?
- [ Gasps ]
Soul mates!
"Party in the bathroom stall, y'all!"
Oh!
Isn't it great that you can still get crazy when you're a mom?
It's time to put the popular girls in their place.
"Hey, catty cheerleaders, you want some real gossip?"
Your jock boyfriends are all in love with each other.
"Ellie, I am trying to focus on my job."
"Me, too."
You think this dumb prom's gonna mock itself?
Prom is not dumb!
It's a beautiful night of magic and wonder.
"And sometimes, a poor kid's life is destroyed forever."
But that won't happen here.
"Oh, no!"
Not on my watch!
It sounds like you're working through some stuff.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
And I gotta get back to my thang.
"Hey, bet you 5 bucks that 5 years from now, that condom will still be in your pocket."
You get it.
He's not gonna ever use it.
It's not that heavy.
There's a couple of odd things about it.
Neither the parka nor the ski mask have any markings on them.
"No way to trace them and they were cut to ribbons, anyway."
"You certainly lock yourself in here, sir."
"And very smart to do it, too."
"Oh, here we go."
"No, that doesn't work either."
You think he mutilated the disguise because he was afraid someone might recognize it?
"Exactly, sir."
"Boy, do you and I think the same way."
It's amazing.
Isn't it?
"I wonder, sir."
"Is there a trick to unlocking this door, sir?"
I can't seem to manage it.
Everybody has trouble with this.
"Thank you very much, sir."
"Oh, did I mention the mask?"
That it was slashed?
No.
That it had makeup on it.
"The lab turned it up, sir."
Where would he find a mask that had makeup on it?
That's a very good question.
I believe you know the answer.
"I believe I do, sir."
We could be looking for a woman.
Precisely.
"We've assumed all along it was a man, but it's possible we were wrong."
Particularly in the light of this.
"Oh, I'm relieved to hear you say that, sir."
I thought you were going to say it was impossible because of Tony.
People are so used to them it would be difficult to scare them.
I bet silence would scare them more.
It'd leave them with their own noises.
Exactly.
Like what happened to me.
What about the play?
Good.
After this long time there's nothing much to do but asking questions.
And Clara?
Did you have any children?
One daughter.
We're separated.
But you were the perfect couple!
"Well, at least to me!"
You're exaggerating.
- It was a crazy love!
I'm telling you!
"Even once, the cops stopped you in the middle of the street!"
Because we were making out.
At that time kissing in the street at daylight...
You tell me.
It was only because we were young.
You still are.
Not long ago I read your article in a magazine.
I can't remember which one.
"You basically said the real protest emerges spontaneously, apart from the political parties."
It wasn't exactly like that.
Something like that.
"As you know, I don't care about politics at all."
I can't do nothing about it.
It must be because of my pessimism.
"But every time I think about those issues, I get useless conclusions."
Use his.
Where is Alexander?
Are you stupid or what?
"There were problems, OK?"
- Why is he on the ground?
- He had this on him.
Why didn't you take him in?
- We wanted to talk to you first.
- Oh?
We were a bit hard on a pusher.
The one who supplies your son.
We broke his rib.
And you're judging the case.
Can I take my son home?
- Get in.
- What about my car?
I'll get it picked up.
If word ever gets out...
PARENTS
I am sure my father realizes perfectly well   that stuff happens that shouldn't.
I don't think he gives a shit.
To him what matters is that I get some qualifications   and when I am with him and his people -
- I play ball and behave the way he wants.
What matters to my parents is that you do something with your life.
They aren't that emotional.
They have no idea what we do at weekends   as long as we get good grades.
It's off their radar.
We haven't had the close family ties everyone else has.
Lousy attention is better than no attention.
Do I feel neglected?
My father has never been to watch me play football or anything.
Some of these parents are unable to help their children to straighten up.
"Now, what do I do with this?"
I'm going through this one
Time for Mr. Carrington to unleash his charm offensive.
"Why, hello, ladies."
"Good morning, sir."
"Mr. Carrington, is there anybody here that you are particularly fond of or have a preference for?"
"Yeah, there is very much somebody"
I'm specifically very close to and feel an enormous attachment to and that's Miss Hopkins.
"As Miss Hopkins' chaperone, it's Lady Devonport's job to keep impoverished playboys at arm's length."
"But having experienced the pitfalls of Regency propriety herself, she's in two minds."
"And as you know,"
I support your interest in her completely.
So next!
No.
How do you propose to support Miss Hopkins?
"Um, with my massive amounts of charm and talent and no money."
And so modest.
"As the chaperones debate the charms of Mr. Carrington,"
"Mr. Everett soldiers on with his maze, helped by old friend Miss Braund."
And then this one here...
So what's this rounded one here?
"When Mr. Everett comes in,"
I know that he's going to...
"Yeah, I agree."
"In fact, either of them are perfectly wonderful."
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, morning."
Do sit down.
Thank you so much.
"The first question is, is there a particular lady here that you like?"
I like Miss Hopkins.
The questions that Professor Rahmi gave me for photocopying...
- Did you look at them?
"- Well, I did this time."
"So, you were just going to help yourself?"
"I couldn't say it, okay?"
I couldn't say it.
"Whatever, it doesn't matter."
Let's not talk about that now.
You are the only guy who's organized systematic on the clock.
"And we need you on this issue, okay?"
"Okay, but I'll only do the planning."
"I won't interfere with the rest, deal?"
Fine.
Are we going to rob Professor Fatma?
No way.
It's fine with me.
"You're the ones who are having difficulty in math, not me."
But it's the most problematic one for all of us.
I think it's ideal for a start.
"Sure, I think so too."
She irritates me anyway.
Let's just start from there.
How are we going to do this?
She was telling us to draw a trapezoid.
"Now, we'll make the best one."
Listen to me.
We'll steal the questions a day before the test.
"Professor Fatma has a bag with a code, right?"
She keeps all her files and grading books in that bag.
"The day before the test, our questions will be in that bag."
How are we going to find the password?
The code is with two digits.
"Yeah, I mean, it's a top-flight policy."
So Preston is playing the savior.
And it looks like that monthly donation that Pamela makes to Preston's campaign is her disability check.
My guess is Trevor authorized that because he feels beholden to Preston.
He probably idolizes him.
So Prestons manipulating the Mills family to further his own agenda.
He's behind everything.
He took advantage of Trevor when he was weak and vulnerable.
"He gains his trust, then he brainwashes him."
Turn him into a killer.
"Uh, guys there's something else."
FBI!
Pamela Mills?
House is empty.
"He's not here, but I found this in his bedroom."
It's addressed to her.
"""The price of peace is sacrifice."
"""And I'm prepared to pay that price, no matter how high."
"I hope you'll still love me."""
This is a good-bye letter.
Or a suicide note.
He doesn't profile as suicidal.
"No, but he knows this could be his final mission."
He may want to go out in a blaze of glory.
It's all about the election.
He's only got one move left.
We need to secure Mayor Wennington.
Have the rest of the team find Hilary Ross.
Mmm.
Hello.
You have reached Hilary Ross.
Please leave a detailed message.
It's only one loaf!
Sometimes it happens to be the l--l--last loaf on the shelf.
"Customer comes in and says, ""I'll take that last loaf off you."""
And I have to turn down a sale.
Do you realise wh--what it does to a shopkeeper to turn down a sale?
I know what it does to you.
You get nasty.
That is a secondary symptom.
The first thing that happens is m--me top lip goes numb.
It goes absolutely lifeless.
It lies there as dead as if it had been n--nationalised.
-
- Me moustache loses all its lustre.
-
- It's looked like that for years!
Never!
"It's been very lively in its time, has this moustache."
"No, it's me lips where rigor mortis s--suddenly sets in."
"Well, they're due for a rest, anyway!"
"It's not funny, Granville!"
"It's a hell of a place for something to die on you, right under your nose!"
A very peculiar sensation.
L--l--I have...
I have d--difficulty f--f--formulating my words.
Really?
I'm sure it's not noticeable!
Me finger ends get all constricted.
Tried taking them out of the pockets?
I don't g--go around with my hands in me p--pockets!
Not your pockets -- other people's pockets!
"Listen, if you want to succeed in business, you have to have a streak of ruthlessness."
Either that or a rich wife!
"- I'm sorry, but the line has fallen."
My speech.
I'll handle it Before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
This speech will write it alone.
"We must first analyze the political, diplomatic and protocol aspects"
"With the head of the cabinet, which is now unreachable."
And with the various federal ministers.
I'm not sure which ones.
"Sire, now we have to watch every movement and gesture, every word."
"Be cautious, sire."
"Faster, faster."
"When the king made his oath, he promised"
To always protect the integrity of the kingdom.
And that King is me.
Unity is strength.
Unity is strength.
We have to put it.
"Carlos knew that I steal hidden pictures, but he let me do it."
Carlos liked me.
Some have a vision.
Others have a dream.
"What does intuition tell you, sire?"
- My intuition?
Perhaps this is the time to show who really is.
"His feelings, his humor, perhaps his faults."
Defects have already been largely occupied by the press.
Nicolas the Silent?
Silence is dignified.
Let them write what they want.
- Sire.
Sire.
I always said you were my brightest student.
It worked.
All living things contain carbon.
"In fact, the term ""organic"" is often defined as"
"""containing carbon."""
"One carbon isotope present in all living forms is carbon-14, which has a half-life of 5,730 years."
"Meaning in that amount of time, half the carbon-14 of a dead organism will decay."
"By measuring the ratio of the remaining carbon-14, we can determine the life of an organic sample, such as the cloth of an Egyptian mummy, or the ashes of a caveman's fire."
Tomorrow I'll demonstrate this process in the university lab.
Hiya.
MacGyver.
Is it really you?
I think so.
"How are you, Kelly?"
I didn't think I'd see you again after you left Thera.
"What's it been, four years?"
Five.
Ah.
"This is for you, teach."
Are you finally flirting with me?
Um...
"Actually, it's a bribe."
I need your help.
Funny.
Didn't think you needed anyone's help.
You'd be surprised.
What is that?
Some kind of oxidized matter.
"Yeah, it's off an artifact Professor Atticus and I found."
"""Atlantis"" Atticus?"
"My grandfather still talks about him, none too fondly, I might add."
"Yeah, I'll bet."
"- Me, too."
Where's Riley?
Let's be honest with each other.
Charlestown needs a makeover.
"It's time to look toward the future, folks."
And the first step toward that future is the Frazier Point Golf Community Country Club and Spa.
Two hundred luxurious new homes!
- Thirty-six holes and...
- Twenty-five orphans without a home.
Who let him in?
Anyone?
He works for me.
I thought he should hear what you have planned for his home.
- Of course.
"- By all means, please continue."
"Yes, do."
"To survive hard times like these, we all have to make sacrifices."
Those making the biggest sacrifices are the boys at Newman.
"But we could use a Wii in every room, or some new dirt bikes, or even a year's supply of Lucky Charms, but other than that we're fine, thanks."
Is that so?
"Hope, the report please."
Rats in the soup pot.
Girlie magazines.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes."
"My dream is simple, folks."
"I want to help the orphans and create a new Charlestown full of life, energy and growth potential."
Help us?
By destroying the only family we've ever known?
"By shipping us off to dangerous big-city homes where kids have tattoos, piercings, and, God forbid, Facebook?"
"City Council, ask yourselves this."
Is a round of golf really worth an orphan's happiness?
"If New Christine and I get married, and you and Jeff get married, you'll be my mother-in-law."
"No, I won't."
The fourth grade class will now sing a song to those important people in our lives we call grandparents.
"Hey, Christine, what do you have when mother-in-law's up to her neck in concrete?"
Not enough concrete.
Funny.
"It was funny 20 minutes ago, and it's funny now."
"# You're a grand old man, # # you're a generous man #"
# And we love how you # # give to our school #
# With your silver hair #
"# You were there last year, # # when we needed an Olympic pool #"
# Should auld # # acquaintance you forget #
# Just remember # # we need your check!
#
"Did you enjoy the singing, Mother Campbell?"
You still got it.
I got another one:
What do you have when your mother-in-law is up to her neck in quicksand?
I hate you?
Close.
Sand that's not quick enough.
"Oh, hey, I got one."
What did the mother-in-law do to thejackass?
What?
Ow!
"Don't pay attention to him, Christine."
What the hell is wrong with you now?
I'm just so happy.
"I love my dad so much, and I've always respected you."
"And now that you're together, it's just so great."
"You know, I never had a very close relationship with my mother."
We hardly ever talked.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal."
They were fake.
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those...kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"And people were throwing things,"
Yelling and screaming and so forth.
"After Duke's 21-20 win in the 1966 acc tournament,"
Smith's offense was ridiculed.
But that didn't stop him from using it --
Even if his players hated it.
The score at half time is 7-0.
"Not football, this is north Carolina basketball versus Duke basketball."
The score is 7-0 at half time.
The score is 7-0 at half time.
You could look it up.
"After the game, reporters come in."
"""Mike, what about the first half, the stall?"""
"""Quite frankly, I didn't want to stall, he did!"""
Pointing to coach Smith.
I get a call.
It's a Sunday.
I get a call.
"""Coach Smith wants to see you in the office."""
"""Oh, shoot."""
"So, I go in, and he sits me down."
"So, I go in, and he sits me down."
"He says, ""Mike, you know, we feel like we have a very successful program here at north Carolina, and we win a lot of games, and we feel we do it the right way."""
"He says, ""listen --"
"I'll do the coaching, you do the playing."""
"""Yes, sir, coach."""
Walked out of there.
"Next day at practice, I had to put the weighted vest on and go up and down the Carmichael auditorium stairs pretty much the whole practice."
He got his point across.
"While the four corners was often brutally boring,"
"While the four corners was often brutally boring, it could also be artful and effective."
"Especially in the hands of Phil Ford, north Carolina's legendary point guard."
"Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?"
Yesterday at breakfast.
He was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
He wanted to open his own wrestling school.
So he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
But they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
Looks like yr husband was quite a successful coach.
"Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?"
No.
Vince was a great guy.
Everyone admired him.
Did he owe anybody money?
Or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
"I'm sorry... but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are."
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Please, give us a call us if you remember anything else."
There was one thing.
"I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof."
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
Looked like two people.
I heard them talking.
Creeping around.
It was kind of scary.
What time was this?
Around 4:00.
I knocked ony neighbor's door.
He said he would go up and check.
And?
"He said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people."
"The response to the polio outbreak in India,"
"He moved on to Somalia,"
Where he served as a field coordinator in huddur.
"While there, he oversaw everything"
From shrapnel wounds to cancer to chronic illness.
Rufus.
"I'm surprised to see you here, of all places."
"Holland, if you'll excuse me."
I'll catch up with you later.
I need to talk to Lily.
"Rufus, what are you doing here?"
I'm sorry about today.
I don't want will to come between us.
I don't give a damn who lives where.
I just want to be with you.
...Improving access to primary health care
To remote villages.
He has done all of this
While continuing to build his reputation
As a leader in the progressive treatments of cancer.
"Lily looks amazing, doesn't she?"
"I mean, being sick hasn't slowed her down at all."
"Yeah, she is the picture of health."
...Invaluable member of our team.
"Ladies and gentlemen,"
Dr. William van Der Woodsen.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dean."
Thank you.
"I had another speech prepared for you this evening,"
"But then my beautiful daughter Serena came to me,"
"And she was so honest and brave,"
And you were the only person who didn't even seem to care.
"People I barely knew were coming up to me all concerned... and you, you acted like you barely even knew me."
"I know, I know I acted like that."
I just didn't know what else to do.
I knew I was the last person on earth you wanted to deal with.
You were the only person I wanted to deal with.
"I wanted to talk to you, too, it just seemed like... you wanted help from everyone but me!"
- l was really scared.
"- l was, too."
I know we have different friends now...
- but sometimes I miss you so much!
"- Me, too."
It really hurts.
Squeeze my hand as hard as it hurts.
You're in my light.
So Sharon's dad is going to be okay.
I heard.
Your friend Rickie told me.
"I was just over there, at Sharon's, I ended staying a pretty long time."
is there some reason you think I should care about this?
I don't know.
You two are friends.
"I guess. I mean we're not, like, really friends."
"But you've been hanging out with her, right?"
Look.
"It was just... she needed me, I mean, not me, but somebody, anybody."
"And I just happened to be there, and we just, so, we just hung out... or whatever, I mean, it could have been anyone."
"No, that's not true, it doesn't work with just anyone... I mean, some people... I think she needed you."
Why?
Because of certain ways that you are.
"What, did you give this thought or something?"
Brian!
"My padre, which is Spanish for father..."
Oh.
I see.
[ Laughter ]
Owns and built racecar tracks.
"So ever since I was a little girl, we'd go to the auto shows and, you know, he would show me about cars."
And I always pretended that...
"I mean, this was our big bonding moment all the time in the year."
"So, I get really into it, and then I realized as I got older and he'd be like, ""why don't you want to race?"""
"You know, I'd be like, ""I'm the actress."
"I'm not gonna do that,"" you know?"
"But really, I think I was just really scared, which is why today is so tough."
"So, I just was always interested in them, had an opinion a about what I liked, what I didn't like."
"So, if you know what you like in a car, what is it?"
What makes a great car to you?
I am definitely attracted to...
"We're talking aesthetics, too."
I drive a mini.
I've driven a mini.
Now I've had three minis.
And what kind of driver would you say you are in that mini?
"Yeah, I drive really aggressively."
"It's like a video game to you, right?"
"Yeah, it's tetris."
I call it tetris driving.
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
"It's basically, I love traffic-tetris driving because you have to make traffic fun."
Right.
And traffic out here is awful.
Yeah.
It's so bad.
"When Stone stepped out of the front door, his career would be over."
"Good luck in the polls, Mr. Stone."
"Mr. Stone, what is this about an alleged--"
Hey!
Hey!
I don't know.
I didn't do anything!
"Then, as the cameras flashed,"
Melissa had the mother of all sneezing fits.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
"Mr. Stone, what did you do to your intern?"
I didn't do anything!
What happened back there?
Do you have a comment?
Melissa suffered from...
"Otherwise known as ""achoo syndrome."""
Achoo syndrome.
It's a genetically inherited condition.
"An exposure bright light can cause you to uncontrollably sneeze,"
"50, 60, 70 times."
"The violent sneezing caused an injury to the lining of her aorta, causing the blood to actually go between the leaves of the heart valve itself, and blood being spewed out into her chest cavity, dying within seconds."
Melissa played Stone like a pro.
I need everyone out front at 7:30.
She set him up to knock him down.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
But then she went down.
Get that thing out of my face!
"God bless ya, bitch."
What do you say we run through this one?
"- Yeah, one more time."
"- All right, let's do it."

Was this girl not named so long?
They name her only now
This is a tradition followed by us
"For newly married,before the family deity"
"She will be named again, same name only"
"After marriage, you will also be named like this"
Why did he come here?
Has he come to defame me?
"Ask him to go out He said, he will not come"
"But he has come, but how can we send him out?"
Will he not keep quiet?
If you put stone mortar in his mouth he will keep quiet
"But he will not keep quiet, when he sees Arul"
Must be bypassing the filters.
I must find the filter system.
"That'll cut off the flow, it was coming through the ventilators."
Filters.
See what you can do for those two.
Avon.
Have you found anything?
Take a look.
"He's the fourth one I've found, all of them unconscious."
It's Sonovapour.
Yes.
I know.
We found a couple.
It must be coming from the filters.
"Yes, well that should be this way."
It's over here.
Here it is.
Not a very expert job.
Just stuck the tubing into the primary feed.
"It's effective, though."
Look at the gauge.
The cylinder is almost empty.
"Once it was empty, the filter system would have cycled the gas out of the atmosphere."
At which point everybody would just wake up.
On the face of it a seemingly pointless exercise.
So wake them up and ask them what it's all about.
"Increase the oxygen supply, it will speed recovery."
He's dead.
Very.
Someone was very thorough.
All this damage has jammed the main controls on a circular flight pattern.
Can it be repaired?
How long's my lunch hour?
An hour.
"Meanwhile, Jay really had arranged some great work experience for Simon, freezing his arse off at a disgusting plant-hire yard."
This is shit.
I don't wanna do this for a living.
"Nah, it's all right!"
"We'll be able to drive the diggers soon, I reckon."
Jay?
Why have you stopped?
"This is work experience, not standing-around-being-a-useless-twat experience."
You don't need any experience at that - you're the expert!
"Sorry, Dad, we only stopped for a moment."
This is well knackering.
"You'd better get used to it, cos with your brains you'll be fucking lucky to get a job throwing shit into a skip!"
This isn't exactly how you described it.
"Get many Valentine's cards, Simon?"
- Just the one.
- One more than Jay's ever got.
- I got plenty.
"- Don't worry, there's a girl out there for you."
You just need to find a desperate bird that likes the smell of BO and blokes with tiny cocks!
"Now get back to work,"
I ain't paying you to sit on your scrawny arse.
Nice.
- All right?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you should be at work?
- They let me go home at lunch.
You jammy bastard.
"Si, what's all this I hear about you having a fight with Danny Moore?"
What?
!
Coffee?
"Thank you, yes."
Right now I'm waiting for Lt. Anderson.
I thought he ought to know about a call I got yesterday afternoon from this man Somers who was murdered.
Mind letting me know about that call?
I represent Axel Norstaad.
Norstaad?
Small world.
Somers wanted me to be ready to file an injunction this morning restraining a man named Norstaad from any future acts of violence and/or interference.
And also to put a private detective on the trail of one Latham Reed.
"I didn't take the case, though."
Too busy.
Who's Reed?
"Some building contractor that Somers said may have made off with a certified check for $50,000."
"When, do you know?"
Yesterday afternoon.
"Oh, there's Anderson now."
If you'll excuse me.
Certainly nice to have seen you both.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
[door closes]
[Axel] No.
It cannot be that you have not heard from her in all this time.
You must tell me where--
Have I interrupted you?
"Please, Mr. Mason."
Why do you not leave like I tell you?
"Well, it seemed obvious you didn't want to talk in front of Lt. Anderson."
But I do not need you.
"Axel, what happened between you and Somers yesterday that caused him instruct his attorney to file an injunction against you?"
"Oh, that."
You disappeared for a few days again and didn't even call.
What was I to do?
Who am I to you?
An empty place?
I'm sitting here in depression and you're waiting for me to serve to you!
Great King!
People who love you caught criminals!
"The people are waiting for you judgement, Solomon!"
Who are these people?
"They are your enemies, great King."
They have destroyed the new sacrifial altar that you built.
In darkness the earth trembles.
I said to them:
"""Gods, sons of the Lord!"
"You're gods but you live like humans and will fall like all the kings."""
The King has ruled to execute the criminals.
Execute them!
"You are the one who should be judged, Solomon!"
Let this execution be a lesson to everyone who dares go against the works of the great King Solomon!
Let justice be done!
It is easy to kill with other people's hands.
"Remember your fear, Solomon."
It will become your sentence.
Solomon!
Our blood is your vanity.
Today you will see us and tomorrow we will see you.
I think they deserve your mercy.
They are enemies of the state.
They believe in you.
And you make them believe in a sin.
I may forgive my enemies but not the enemies of the state.
Turn to the bureaucrats we know.
"You're right, that didn't help me at all."
"All right, well, I can tell you this:"
"Gay or straight, you're not gonna get anywhere by being inactive."
She likes you.
Maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.
"Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin, will you?"
- Thanks.
- Here you go.
TRENT:
"If a girl's into you, she's sleeping with you."
"If after a month, or two months at the very outside she's not sleeping with you?"
She doesn't like you.
The trick is to spot this girl early.
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.
So I've come up with some signs about how to spot this girl.
"A girl will never sleep with you if she calls you ""cuddly"" or ""dependable."""
"If she pops a zit in front of you if her name is Amber or Christine if she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers on dates one, two, or three."
"I know it's not scientific but I'm just saying, you were warned."
"Wait, stop."
What?
BEN:
Shit.
What?
I am so into you.
"Seriously, I've never felt like this before."
I have to actively stop my brain from thinking about you.
"Like, all the time."
Why stop?
Because I don't do stuff like this.
Stuff like what?
Like sleep with women that aren't my wife.
"First of all, I am not ""women,"" I'm just one."
"I tell you, I will not fall for you!"
You deserve to be put behind bars.
You deserve to die in jail!
You are too bad!
"I tell you, you jinx!"
Serve you right!
Quiet
"Your Honour,"
I've proved that his motive is doubtful...
"Your Honour, the accused's look doesn't make sense with killing."
"By the way, the..."
Wait!
"You should wait, by the way..."
Listen to me first.
"Even he wanted to kill Chun, he would go some place else."
It's senseless to kill in the place where he is working.
What do you think the cause of Chun's death?
"I don't know, you'd better think!"
"Maybe, Ho Chun wanted to rape Foon."
But he failed.
So he committed suicide and made Foon be the scapegoat.
"Chan Mon-gut, this is the British court, not the poor court of you Chinese."
I don't know what you are doing here.
You don't know anything about law.
Please go back to study more.
"Even you don't think of your own reputation, you'd think of the face of your fellow people."
Sorry...
He always mentions the United Kingdom.
It seems he's forgotten that Hong Kong was leased to the UK.
They have to return it one day!
"Damn it, how dare he be that cocky in our territory!"
?
That's my business.
But you...
I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.
"Well, I'm trying to fight a war."
I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
"Anything for the cause, Major."
"Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five cylons."
Maybe the face of God himself.
"... the five lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light..."
Scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple.
Only to the chosen one.
The chosen one.
The chosen one.
The five await me.
"Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth."
What truth ?
Caprica.
I'd like to think that we three have shared something.
Transcended the barriers that separate people.
"And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in."
"Well, that's not the case at all."
Is it ?
"Because we three, we're integral."
We're part of...
We're finished.
"Baltar's and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica."
The five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple.
We have to go down to the planet.
"Only you and I, can see this through."
What are you after ?
What is this secret that you keep pursuing ?
You have to tell me the truth.
The investigation is ongoing.
Ussing's affairs are being checked.
I'm siding with Ussing.
I hope you understand.
"The public prosecutor was reluctant, but Ussing insisted strongly."
Step down of your own accord or we'll have to withdraw our support.
We're looking for someone who may have been close to Louise.
- She only had us.
- Did anyone else see her that day?
One of your colleagues called to ask about the same things an hour ago.
"Why would the perpetrator use your name, if he doesn't know you?"
- Was Special Branch involved in this?
- I wasn't involved in that case.
- Why don't you believe me?
- What are you talking about?
You shut everyone out.
"Me, us, your son."
No one's allowed into your life.
Her bike got broken that morning.
I think that's why she got a lift.
There was a man in a black car.
Those are all his notebooks.
He's crazy about car registrations.
- Where does that road lead?
- To a closed boat builder's yard.
That looks like Louise Hjelby's bike.
This is where she was taken.
Borch took the boy's book with license plate numbers this morning.
It was you and Special Branch who erased everything about the black car.
- I'm not discussing this.
- Why is that book important?
THE KILLING Ill
"Who is this ""someone"" to whom a citizen can ""go"""
that isn't so far up the cop's ass you need a digging crew to find them?
"There's only one person,"
And he's got the best investigators in the state.
The footage disappeared while you were looking at it?
Who has the access to do that?
Only the police.
And the shooting?
"Besides me, only the police knew where DeBray was headed."
"You're leveling quite an accusation, Laura."
That's not the worst part.
The jewelry from DeBray's apartment never made it to lockup.
It's gone.
"Well, DeBray is dead."
What does somebody gain from stealing that evidence?
I don't know.
"But whatever these people are trying to hide, the man who shot Haskell DeBray is out there."
"Tom, if you nail the dirty cop and get him to talk, you can catch the killer before he kills someone else."
"Then I'm gonna have to nail him, aren't I?"
"It goes without saying this stays in this room, right?"
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Good.
Good.
"Okay, Janet?"
"Serena, how about we take you home, little lady, and we have taco night at the ranch?"
- I make the guacamole.
- Deal.
"Captain Nico, you come, too."
"Sorry, Serena."
Captain Nico's got to catch a couple more bad guys before I can have a taco.
"Janet, can you have them bring up my car?"
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please let me go.
I don't want to die here.
Please.
Please let me go.

"I'm not talking about the kind that slows your computer down, and gives you pop-up ads for boner pills."

It's like Microsoft Office for black hat hackers.
"It's a suite of malware that includes key loggers, root kits, and fingerprint evasions"
Real scary stuff.
"The thing is, we found the executable file that infected Addison's system."
It was installed over five months ago.
"So the spyware landed on her computer before she was catfished by Mintz, which means that it had to be her kidnapper who infected her."

- Hi.
- Maggie.
You seriously didn't have to come see me off.
"- No, I did."
"- No, you didn't."
I've got pretty good instincts when it comes to breakups.
They teach us situational awareness in boot camp.
You were sending some very clear signals.
No!
"No, I wasn't sending clear signals."
That's the thing.
"Uh, you barely dressed up to see me, wouldn't even kiss me, and that diner..."
- Kind of the opposite of romantic.
- I know.
I know.
I...
I've been trying really hard to keep you at bay so I wouldn't screw this up like I have my other relationships.
What are you talking about?
It's just...
I've made a lot of mistakes in the past.
And I don't want to repeat them.
So I'm just gonna be honest with you and hope that you don't want to break up with me after I say all this.
"The fact is, I sleep with people way too soon..."
Or people who are just wrong for me and think it's love.
"Because I totally confuse sex with love, and then I get my heart broken or make huge mistakes."
And I really like you.
"You see something,abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean,it's tragic,but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a tv set?
It says it all.
"Well,it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
- Still got my eyebrows.
- Good point.
"I found finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he s probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
After being undergroun it's unlikely.
"Strange case,huh?"
I had th friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an nea grant... - abby.
"Um,next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Thing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
I sent the acidity levels to ducky.
I then inventoried finn's personal items.
- Got anything with a date on it?
- Nope.Sorry.
If the key was already in the keyhole... then how did your fingerprints... get on the middle barrel of the key?
"I mean, if you had only turned the key, like you just said... then your fingerprints wouldn't be there, right?"
The fact of the matter is... when you broke the pane and put your hand in... the key was already in your hand.

I didn't do...

Out.
"You too, Mr. Menon."
"If I had a pistol, you wouldn't have been alive right now."
"In that case, thank you for not carrying a gun."
Natasha.
Her gun.
"May I ask you something, Mr. Menon?"
When did you piece the puzzle together?
At the hospital.
If I hadn't seen the photograph...
I wouldn't have known that you and Kabir were identical twins.
"And they say, twins... don't give birth to twins."
"It's over, Malhotra."
Game over.
It's your game that is over.

And you?
I am called Levett.
Did you see or hear anything?
I was asleep in my quarters.
Would anybody else have seen you there?
- Why should anyone else bother?
"- All right, there's no need for that."
"There are worse things than being alone, Sonheim."

"I shall be delighted, Captain."
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers.
He sets a good table.
Aka more aliases than they would care to mention.
They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big-time.
- I smell artifact.
- I smell a loser.
Come on.
"Let's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary, all right?"
- Thank you very much.
Much appreciated.
- You're welcome.
- So what is this... this artifact?
- It's unconfirmed.
"But if there's one, it's given these two an unbelievable amount of luck."
That defies all the laws of probability.
"They've had winning streaks in Miami, Detroit and Atlantic City..."
Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped.
"Well, how?"
"Well, they go into a gaming room as high rollers."
Anybody?
"Okay, fine."
And they're really good.
"And they win just enough money to stay under the radar, right?"
And then they get...
Fine.
They move on and don't get caught.
So they're taking a little back from the house.
"OMG, what's the BFD?"
What?
Iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate.
"- ""Iniquitous"" means ""bad."""
"- Thanks, Roget."
So where are they now?
"3 hours ago, they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus hotel in Las Vegas."
"Ah, ah..."
"Wow, my favorite little kids are not so little anymore."
Are you staying long this time?
He's not staying.
"Kayla, Jared, go get ready for bed."
I'll be there in a minute.
I want him out of my house now.
The only time you ever go over my head is because of Michael.
"Jackie, calm down."
What problem are you bailing him out of now?
It was a misunderstanding.
Always is.
"He was trying to do the right thing, he ended up a murder suspect."
A murder suspect?
"We have the killer in custody, Jackie."
He didn't do it.
"Of course he didn't, but how does he get in these messes in the first place?"
And with you dragged into it?
- This is different.
- Is it?
"I mean, his whole life has been one bad decision after another, always knowing that you're gonna be there to save the day."
People change.
"Leon, you have fathered him long enough."
When are you gonna let him stand up on his own two feet?
"He's getting ready to open a repair shop, Jackie."
His repair shop.
And two years ago he was going to finish college.
"A year before that, he was, he was selling that, that, that miracle drink."
"Well, at least he's trying, Jackie."
He's come a long way from where he was.
You do not need to remind me where he was.
"You know that I love him and I always will, and I had to let him go and I ju..."
6- year-old James Bone  on his way to school.
Ballistics from the police lab confirm  the wayward bullet that killed the boy came from Zapatti's gun...
"Here you are, Mr. Zapatti."
Michael find Vinnie.
I want to have a little talk with him.
"Yesterday, on the corner of Broadway  and Marcy Street, gunfire broke out  claiming 6-year-old James Bone  along with 21-year-old Tino Zapatti  a convicted felon on probation  and a 32-year-old police detective, Eddie Santos."
The Police Commissioner has disclosed  that an investigation is underway into Santos' activities.
Question:
What was Santos doing with a drug dealer  wanted for probation violations?
Good morning.
It will raise serious questions of corruption in the courts.
"Stern gave Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer  probation instead of sending him to prison."
The question everyone is asking  because of this unusual disposition  is why did the judge do that?
"Good morning, Mrs. Santos."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
- It's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
Goering: 12.
Could we say that half of those were non-Jews?
"were Christians, atheists and pagans."
Hitler:
Awkward language.
"What term covers Gypsies, Polish intelligentsia,"
"Russian upper strata, prisoners of war,"
"French and Yugoslavian partisans, political opponents?"
"Well, should we say ""gentiles""?"
But if 12 million were liquidated and only six million were Jews-- or is it 5.7?
Why can't I get accurate figures?
!
Where's Himmler?
!
I would stand behind this wording.
Almost half the dead were from the Christian world.
( Hitler mutters ) Yes.
And yet the Jews take their removal so personally.
( Goering laughs )
"What strikes me is that little notice is taken of the fact that the first biological cleansing eliminated German nationals-- the disabled, the retarded,"
- the mentally ill--
- And the bedwetters.
The useless eaters.
"Commenced the 1st of September, 1939."
"Actually, mein Führer, it was October 1st."
You backdated the decree one month to correspond with the first day of the war.
- Tidier.
- Yes.
- War for living space.
- Yes.
- War for race purification.
- Yes.
- Hey.
"- Hey, Madam Senator."
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
I wish you'd heard the speech.
That line you gave me about...
"""If we can put a man on the moon, then why can't we put all men on the moon?"""
It was perfect.
It really broke the ice.
"- Great audience for that, huh?"
"- Yeah, it was great."
What's goin' on?
"Uh... well, it looks like Runyon or somebody close to him... has been running a little private investigation... looking for stuff that the Feds wouldn't even touch."
"- It's, um..."
- Yeah?
What is it?
What...
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- You're asking me to step down?
I'm asking you to do what's in the best interest of the party... and this president.
"Well, I'm sorry."
"I can't do it, not over this."
He's not going to allow me or himself... to get shot down over what would've been a private sexual encounter.
"- Some swan song for the old man, huh?"
- It's fuckin' awful.
The senator got a little wild when she was 19.
What is the big deal?
Let me explain the big deal to you.
The people of this nation can stomach quite a bit.
But one thing they can't stomach is the image of a vice president with a mouthful of cock.
You don't have to use...
Look.
I led the others.
I shot out your mirror machine.
Did you think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
I took that chance.
I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
"Oh, then you do admit to the charges?"
"Yes, anything!"
Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
Uhh!
You pompous--
Immaterial!
Those people have done you no harm.
Inadmissible!
"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
Silence!
This trial is over.
You are guilty.
"On all counts, you are guilty."
"According to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment."

"Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.3."
First Officer Spock reporting.
Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us.
Waiting time is almost up.
I willsoon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions.
"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was."
I did it.
I was angry.
I actually experienced genuine rage.
This experiment has been successful.
I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
"Why, Captain, you're still angry."
"If they know me and I go to school with her, then she... I don't know who she goes to school with, I don't go there."
"You talk the most, but you haven't shown us anything yet."
Then I'll show you...
Those kinds of dances didn't exist when I was young.
What is this dance called?
- Are you going to start now?
"- No, we're finishing."
"Don't they teach you the polka, only those modern ones?"
"They do, but there's no room there for such things."
You can't dance the polka?
Where do you dance?
"The polka is almost like skipping around, and where can you... lt's a kind of rhythmical skipping to a polka..."
Don't you know some tune?
The polka melody's like this... lt'll survive three generations.
"I'll tell you about one polka you know, it's gone round the world."
You of all people know it!
"Wait, wait!"
I'll show you.
Roll out the Barrel.
That's it!
It held the whole world together throughout the war.
"That's music, the real thing."
Let's try it!
"Mummy, play one of those... I'm already playing."
"Better something else, the tango, for example."
Better the tango.
I'll show you how it should be danced.
"Slowly, just hold me."
We'll just move our bodies like...
people in love.
In love?
She's eighteen!
"Not modern, just something better, we're not so poor we can't afford it."
We paid for it and what happened?
Did I need a dance for that?
It was all your fault.
is this how one imagines life will be?
is this what you prepared for us?
"You invited me, so I went."
"We did, but what are you telling me!"
Then where am I to go with you?
It wasn't the expense I minded.
Should I go to the cemetery with you?
That won't cost anything.
And you can be sad there!
And you can be quiet there.
It'd be just the right place for you.
"All my youth, with you..."
What did I get from it?
Youth!
Did you think you'd always be young?
When did I have a good time?
When did I go to a party?
When could I afford anything?
I came from Prague during the Protectorate.
First I went to school and then...
You could add that first you were born.
Let's begin at the beginning.
"Go on, say it was a pity we went there."
So we were there.
That was all we experienced and then it was over.
Nineteen fifty-three came and we went broke.
"But you kept saying, it'll be all right..."
"You philosophized, speculated, until you overdid it and lost all."
We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
"So, enjoy!"
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested by the military police.
"Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket."
He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
"But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't."
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels for 50 years.
It's in their blood.
"I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties."
We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels.
"Sit down, Michael."
Sit down.
"If I could only live to see it, to be there with you."
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
"Here we are, protected."
"Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI."
"90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government."
90 miles.
It's nothing.
"This is Gordon, Sir."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
You're from Canada?
I'm very glad to see you here.
"Thank you, Sir."
Where do you come from?
"London, Sir."
"Yes, I suppose I should have known."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
"Company, eyes left!"
You've been rehearsing this for months on mock-ups of the terrain.
It should be as familiar to you as the back of your hand.
"Only, this is the real thing."
Operation Pegasus goes tonight.
You all know its purpose.
It's to bring back a piece of German radar equipment that's been helping to shoot down our bombers.
To recapitulate for the last time.
"Our first group will take the house and the radar post,"
"Meanwhile, we will hold off the Gerry garrison in the farmhouse."
Our second group will take and hold the beaches where we'll join them until the Navy can take us out.
Any questions?
Any suggestions?
Right.
"You men come from a lot of different places and a lot different units, but you have certain things in common."

The rest is up to you.
Good hunting.
"New testimony will be provided by Harris' 17-year-old stepdaughter, Amy."
"... first-degree murder, which could result in a sentence..."
Such a nice couple.
"We really thought they""d make it."
I thought so.
We prayed for them.
Why did all of America become so obsessed with the Clara Harris story?
"Because it happened to a middle-class, dual-income, respectable family."
"Because it happened in the suburbs, where good people like you and me live."
Because if a sickness can grow inside the Harris family... are any of us really immune?
We all know...
Clara received the maximum sentence:
20 years in prison.
David's own parents forgave Clara.
They begged the judge for leniency.
The woman prosecutor used this argument to convict:
Why didn't Clara Harris do what every other woman in her situation does?
Take her husband to the cleaners.
Divorce David?
Take him to the cleaners?
"I'm sorry, but that woman missed the boat entirely."
Clara didn't want a divorce.
Clara Harris was in a life-and-death fight for her family.
Her survival instincts kicked in.
I want you to ask yourself:
Would you kill to save your family?
"Oh, my!"
You ready?
"Cassie, what is it?"
"I can""t do this."
"I can""t do it."
"We""ll be there in five minutes."
- No.
I misunderstood your behaviour.
But I would like this not to occur many times.
"This never happens more, respectable major lord."
Well this not something turned out nicely.
Not trouble.
It is not the important one.
The beauty arrives then.
It is necessary to wait its time out only.
It is the important one that we are here.
We are together.
Our hand moves.
The time goes by.
How do you feel?
"Very much, very much good."
"Really, very well."
Tót family did not get used to the night out however.
After 2-3 clocks the signs of the tiredness on they start appearing.
And this the tiredness showed on disciplined Tót mostly.
What it is possible to understand of course.
Since he slept in his bed already at this time another time
"Well you know, simply fascinating this work."
"Do not know to say, how much I enjoy it."
"I know that now, this work brings me into order then totally."
If only would be so.
"We would be glad the best, major lord."
Are you not tired?
"I hope so, you speak if you want to sleep."
To sleep.
Yet what no.
Very good one like that to do this with the major lord.
I am me so with him somehow.
Grace is against it.
"They've had a very bad PR campaign in this country, badgers."
Me and Brian agree on this.
You very rarely hear a good news story about badgers.
"You never hear how you're hit by a truck in the middle of nowhere and next of all, five badgers took me to AE."
With their little paws.
You know Clint Eastwood in Honkytonk Man?
You know the film Honkytonk Man?
I feel a non sequitur coming on.
Did he ever at any point in that movie bump into a badger?
What happens in that one?
He's made up a film that doesn't exist.
"Honkytonk Man is a genuine film about a singer who gets TB and at no point in that movie is there a black and white flash in the background and then, ""I feel a cough coming on."""
You know about culture and stuff.
Is that a real thing?
No.
Honkytonk Man's a genuine film!
Was my sole purpose here...?
Is this an intervention?
Yeah.
Honkytonk Man's a really...
"When he makes something up, pin him down on it!"
Don't just laugh and let him go.
Please keep this in.
Has anybody heard of it?
It was a dream!
It was a dream!
Has anyone heard of Honkytonk Man?
"Why would Clint do tuberculosis, for goodness sake?"
You know what?
"Jesus Christ, this is how the Nazis started - just an idea round the table."
It's a really good film!

"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now."
Where are we?
Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos.
What happened?
Fill me in.
You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu.
We've been looking for you for four hours.
"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by,"
I simply could not resist.
I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
"Ah, so you're the captain of these brave lads."
"My greetings and felicitations, Captain."
"So good ofyou and your officers to, uh... drop in."
Absolutely smashing.
Who are you?
Where do you come from?
"General Trelane, retired."
"At your service, sirs."
My home is your home.
"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain."
We're trapped here.
I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby.
"Yes, but according to my observations,"
I didn't think you capable of such voyages.
"Notice the period, Captain."
900 light-years from Earth.
It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.
"Ah, yes."
And I am going to need you for a half hour at the deputy's meeting.
I'm on the hill all afternoon.
With who?
Senator Gottfried.
"This wouldn't have anything to do with him being on the Foreign Relations Committee, would it?"
"Well, the ambassadorship may come up."
Smart move-- he'll be a key swing vote during confirmation hearings.
"I thought you were firmly against this, against us moving."
Why the change of heart?
Because it's clear how much it means to you.
"What happens if you actually get it, we'll have to deal with."
"Until then, I am here to support you."
But...
"Oh, I knew there was a ""but."""
You got to put on a full-court press.
"You got to lobby, politick, schmooze."
And a 45-minute sit-down at the Hart Office building is not gonna cut it.
What were you thinking?
"Dinner, our house, with wives."
- You hate hostessing.
- I know.
I do.
But I can put on a good show if I need to.
These are hands-down the best croquetas I've ever had.
This was my favorite part of living on the move as a kid-- all the new food.
I'm sure it was a relief to get away from the Moscow cuisine.
You got that right.
"At eight years old, I'd had enough borscht to last a lifetime."
You defected when you were eight?
- Mm-hmm.
- You must've been scared.
My sister was even younger.
What are you drinking?
Water.
Seriously?
"If it was a joke, would it be funny?"
"No, no, I mean, to each his own."
We interrupt this game to bring you this breaking news story right now.
"Jim O'Bannon, host of The O'Bannon files, a sometimes controversial news and opinion show viewed by millions, was found dead just minutes ago outside a downtown restaurant."
At this time...
Barkeep.
...police tell us that apparently he was shot to death at close range alongside two of his bodyguards.
Jim O'Bannon was 58.
We now return you back to the game.
"So Jim O'Bannon, huh?"
"That's kind of crazy, him getting killed."
"Him being a big TV star and all, don't you think?"
Fame doesn't make you invincible.
"Yeah, and I always thought he was a bit of a jackass, but nobody deserves to die, you know."
I'm Allan.
How you doing?
"What is this, some kind of fag bar?"
"No, I was just..."
I'm sorry.
"I was just trying to make some friendly conversation, that's all."
"It's like I got ""Everlast"" stamped across my face, man."
Like a human punching bag.
"Can I have another one, please?"
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
"Whatever, man."
It's cool.
"When I spoke to you earlier,"
I must have given off the impression that I was game for conversation.
Any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
Then why don't you just relax?
"Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good."
?
"Think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her... to touch her."
"Josh, eww."
What?
He needs an emotional trigger.
The other thing I need is silence.
Good idea.
"Lori, out!"
What did I do?
This is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
She could have stayed.
"Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it."
"Listen, Kyle,"
I get how messed up you are right now.
"If anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again,"
"I'd be a mess, too."
But you've got to pull it together.
You really think I can do this?
Knowing how much you care about Amanda?
Zero doubts.
Come on.
"Deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time."
"By focusing,"
"I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road."
"In this case, the road led into the Trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer."
"Through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system."
I've got nothing on.
"In fact, I'm going back to the wharves."
"In fact, I'm going back to the wharves."
We don't need to know what the job is.
We don't need to know what the job is.
"In fact, we don't care, mate."
We don't.
"In fact, we don't care, mate."
We don't.
"But what you've got to remember, Ray, is nothing's changed."
"But what you've got to remember, Ray, is nothing's changed."
So if you want our tick of approval...
So if you want our tick of approval...
"Ray, you want our tick of approval, mate."
"Ray, you want our tick of approval, mate."
..we get a big drink out of it.

Good night.

How are you?
"- Good evening, Mr. Weller."
"Just in time, sir."
Just locking up.
Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over here I'll walk up to the east gate with you.
"Wonderful nights we're having, sir."
"And don't you believe about this here comet and the ""world coming to an end"" business."
"If you ask me, it don't amount to a row of beans."
"Newspaper talk, that's what I calls it."
Don't you believe it.
Step down to Lloyd's and take out an insurance policy and it won't cost you more than it did last week when there was no talk of a comet or the world running into one.
"Those fellows know what they're talking about, sir."
You take that from me.
"Mr. Weller, here's a point."
"If you had a balloon that carried a man to Mars and the pilot you picked suddenly disappeared, would you get in the balloon yourself and cast off?"
A balloon?
"Well, that's a good one, sir."
I think you got me there.
I don't know though.
"If I had a balloon that would take me there and back, mind you, I don't know that I wouldn't have a go at it."
Might get me away from me mother-in-law for a while.
"How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Fair enough, Mr. Weller."
Fair enough.
Yes?
What?
My father made me promise no fighting outside the academy
That's pretty useless

"Shinbo, come on, hit me like you mean it"
"Hey, that's dangerous"
"Come and get me, crybaby"
"You want to win, right?"
- I don't know.
It's gonna take a little more yabba yabba.
Good.
Go help Ziva and McGee.
I gotta see a lady about a card game.
"Anything, Abbs?"
"Four decks scanned, two to go."
"Naturally, there's no shortage of fingerprints."
- I.D.'s?
- Mostly sailors.
And the blackjack dealer.
Of course.
He touched every card.
"You know, it would help to know if I was looking for someone specifically."
Yeah.
Just keep looking.
"That the best you got, McGee?"
"Well, the only surveillance of the pizzeria was from a rooftop across the street."
"Lucky us, all the video files were corrupted."
"But we believe this is Petty Officer Adams, based on the time he is seen leaving the pizzeria and the direction he is headed."
Anyone else?
There's this man.
Left a few frames before.
Who is he?
"Well, we still don't have a clear shot of his face yet, Director."
Wait-- in the window-- is that a reflection?
"Enhance it, McGee."
He appears to be a civilian.
Sailor said a guy bragged to him about winning money.
"A ton of it, only, he was too impaired to remember who it was."
"But the game was rigged, so no one could have won a ton of money."
And that would make that winner a shill.
Maybe she still won't go out with you.
"Oh, god this is a fucking disaster."
"No actually, it's OK, it's fine."
- I can move away and change schools.
- My night hasn't been brilliant either.

They heal all wounds.
After about 1000 of them I'm still amazed.
But your poor liver has had to work so hard.
"I know, I know."
- I'm very proud of her.
- Your liver's female?
Away from all the problems of the world.
I think I might have brought my problems with me.
Away you go then.
It's just that I want to write something.
"Well, then write it!"
About Trina.
"Ah, right."
"A life must be worth a few well chosen words more than just ""Body found in car."""
"Yeah, but there are so many rumours flying around now."
You can't even see the ducks from the trees.
I think you might find the expression is 'wood from the trees'.
It doesn't even make any sense.
Trees are made of wood.
"Yeah, yeah that's the point."
"Nah, I still don't get it."
"But anyway, back to your problem."
"Which is essentially that if I, if I write only the bare facts,"
I feel like I would have done her and injustice.
"Yeah, but on the other hand you don't want to upset anyone and you know, go into messy, gory details."
"No, I don't want to do that."
I was out here the other morning and right before my eyes
I saw two dolphins mating.
It was beautiful.
Beautiful!
But also a bit disturbing.
"Yeah, I can imagine."
"And when they get, you know, quite passionate, they actually bite each other's fins."
Quite badly.
It can scar them for life.
Is that what happened?
"Nah, nah, nah, a killer whale appeared and chased them off."
And me.
Bondage between the mother and the child is the umbilical cord
Why are you such a mean minded dad?
-Did I ever say I am the dad
-You said she is your girl
- Did I say I am her father?
- What do you mean?
"Today it is Karnataka, tomorrow it is Andhra"
- Day after?
- Kerala
Then it should be done for you and not her
-Where?
- Here
Don't lock me in your soul with my anklet
Oh Casanova!
-Subbu send 2 fags - will send it
You have breakfast at your house but want coffee of ours?
"Yes, because your filter coffee is superb"
-But seems it is not prepared by you
-Might be by her dad
Mind your business
Shouldn't smoke in public places
"If the legs are out, it is public place"
"If it is in, it is private"
"Tomato,Brinjal, Raddish, drumstick, beans"
"Ladies finger, snake gourd,...."
"What Ponni, You were not to be seen?"
"It's nothing, Arul"
I had a marriage proposal
Did you like the groom?
When we gave snacks They asked for liquour
What happened then?
My dad smacked and they ran away
You still itching for more?
Some guys never learn.
Here's some ice off the roof.
"Beat it, you little stooge."
"Go on, tell the crumb where he stands."
I called a meeting of the barracks chiefs this morning.
I thought I could get you transferred into another barracks.
But it turns out that nobody likes you any more than we do.
"So you're stuck with me, huh?"
Maybe the Russian broads would take him.
"Not with that kisser, not anymore."
"You got off lucky last night, Sefton."
One more move and you'll wake up with your throat cut.
"You listening, Sefton?"
"Yeah, I still got one good ear."
"Now, you listen to me."
There are two guys in this barracks that know I didn't do it.
Me and the guy that did do it.
And it could be any one of you.
"You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price or the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey."
"And he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick."
If there's gonna be any throats cut in this barrack--
"Out, out!"
Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!
"As you were, gentlemen."
Please.
Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses 75 men.
"Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally."
Naturally.
It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
"As for the blankets, you will notice they're very warm."
I was bowled over by her journey.
And that was priceless.
Stop sticking your weenie into what's not yours!
"You know other ways to prove your cocksmanship, don't you?"
Shut it!
"Watch it, Albert..."
The good lord rears his ugly head when a prick tries not to understand.
"As long as you punch me, Albert!"
When you're punching me I know you're alive!
"At last, we got the address for Mickey's hidey-hole!"
We've been in the know for an hour.
Savvy?
You'll understand.
Sorry for now.
Sorry for before.
Sorry for after.
I didn't know how to get hold of you.
"By the time I snuffed out the fuse, you'd disappeared."
I called back.
I looked.
"Le Baron tracked you down, he looked up the name of your cousin, thanks to her centerfold in that nudie mag."
"He bought out this apartment, just across from yours, because I asked them to."
Top dollar!
They never understood my caprices!
And Mickey?
What did you do to him?
I destroy everything I love!
"I told you, I am a liar."
"The Venom is here, not entirely eradicated."
"By the way, did you know he used to be one of my mother's lovers?"
"He just found out that you can't put a price tag on love, this venomous man."
A small time punk proved to him that he couldn't keep something that he thought he could junk.
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.
I then inventoried Finn's personal items.
Got anything with a date on it?
Nope.
Sorry.
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a cash guy.
His clothes were Dockers from Sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large, the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear, Gibbs."
"You're fishin', Ab"
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer, have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes, Doctor."
"Well, let's  plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
Agent Gibbs will be here soon and he will ask...
"How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try, ""When did he die?"""
That's my next question.
"That, I can answer."
It's....a......... ... tricky calculation.
"One has to factor in temperature, soil acidity, and the  variety and volume of insects who now call Lance Corporal Finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days, with a three-percent margin of error."
It would appear you deserted before you died.
One second!
What are you doing here?
"We're tutoring them, it's all completely legal!"
Where... did the previous tenants go?
I came here two weeks ago.
And I don't know the previous tenants.
"Oh, Tae Ho!"
Why are you coming out of that room?
Did you get them mixed up?
What are you talking about?
That room was just storage space for our equipment.
Since we had a lot of communications equipment...
"And because the rent was so expensive we sent the equipment to the head office, and let the room go up for rent."
How does that make any sense?
"There were two men, and this woman, both of whom you work with, in that room!"
The two men!
Where are they?
We didn't come here to play.
We are here because of a murder!
And I know you ordered them to do all of this!
You?
So this is how you're going to be?
- Jung In!
- Yes?
Have you ever been to room 866?
No.
"See, Tae Ho?"
What reason would we have to hire two more male employees?
When all we have to do is gather the agents whenever they showed up!
I know your job is to trick people.
"But try to do it in moderation, okay?"
"I'm telling you that I saw them, very clearly, with my own eyes."
- The guy you kind of saw?
The guy that I saw leaving must've stolen the sword
And hidden in this room over here
When he set off the bomb.
I collected these grenades years ago.
Every last one of them.
I know I did.
"So, wait, whoever stole the sword"
Has other things that belong in the warehouse--
Which would mean that we have competition.
I don't know.
"Artie, just how long is this list of things"
We don't know?
I don't know.
About twice as long as the list of things
"That I don't know about, all right?"
"Well, who else would have these implosion grenades, Artie,"
"I mean, if you collected them all?"
"Well, whoever it is, if he's willing to use this"
"To cover his tracks, then it's somebody that's--"
What's a darker word for dangerous?
"If he did this to steal the sword,"
He'd have no trouble killing anyone
Who got in his way.
"Oh, none at all."
"Next time, don't get a suite--just a room."
Okay.
The lead here is the implosion grenade.
We find out who had one of those
And then we find out
Who has the sword.
"Okay, let me just--"
"We use standard fiberglass insulation, cdx subfloor."
You see something?
"Well,yeah,your joist,24 inches on center."
I wod have built them on 16.
Then you wouldn't make a profit.
That joist there look discolored to you?
Could be mold.
Mold spreads from the bottom up.
"Need a black.On it,boss."
We'll be there soon.
"Boss,abby ran the prepaid phone rd we found in finn's pocket."
Had only one call in it.
"It was to a self-storage company in dale city,virgia."
Good.Call the storage...
I did.
how ****I was just taking a breath.
I called the self-storage place.
"Finn paid for the un in cash, only signed in once, so I figured that ziva and i should probably get down therand check it out."
Sorry abouthe breath.
Kind of reminds me of pacific heights.
Don't tell me.
"-A movie -yeah,interesting plot."
Yuppie couple buys their dream house then the tenant from hell tries to destroy it.
Michael keaton's best work.
Looks like organic material.
Would a two by six match finns head injury?
Ducky thinks the blunt object hit his temple.
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.
Which would have landed him nose-first in th insulation.
Get a sample of this wood back to abby.
"Oh,my god!"
"Bob,why are you letting them destroy our property?"
She's so cute
Miyu... must be amazing to have a girlfriend like her
"No, we need to take her back"
Taking her back to where?
Back to her hometown obviously
I wanna go home too
So give me some train money
"Come on, please"
Come on
I still don't get it
Why'd we have to pay money to that guy?
We should have bought that BL book
"Those guys only have 5, no 3 years left"
Their lives are peaking right now
Grandpa said that people who are nasty will always fail at life
It was just two guys.
"We have two guys too, you know?"
I don't know...
Bebi... ..you're a grown man
Sorry
I've always been like this
I was bullied a lot too by guys like that
But even at this age...
I'm so sorry
Bebi it's ok.
They looked even stronger than Big Sis
"Their smirks were weirder than Big Sis's and they're a lot bigger than her, too"
"They had bigger boobs than her, too"
Hey there
Thanks
It just irritates me.
"Not only them, but with myself"
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
You know what she said?
"She said, ""Vijay are you cross with me?"
"I said, come on, why would I be angy with you?"
"Why do you think like this, Meena?"
"She said, ""Vijay, why do you always remain far from me?"
"""You never even give me a look"""
"And then when I gave her a look, do you know what I saw, Sheetal?"
I saw mo large drops oftears in her large eyes.
That moment I realised that this girl loves me from within her heart.
She considers me to be her god.
I said...
"Meena don't, I can't bear to see tears in your eyes."
For my sake wipe it.
Please!
Excuse me.
This isn't your Meena's arm.
"You won't be doing the Lindy overnight... but with proper care, that leg will be 1 00%."
Why is there a bandage on my hand?
What's wrong with it?
"When you consider that boys come through here every day... and lose their sight, limbs, even their lives--"
What happened to my hand?
"Well, you have some nerve and tendon damage."
"Fortunately, there will be only slightly diminished use of three fingers."
- They'll look perfectly normal.
"- What do you mean, ""slightly diminished""?"
There will be a certain loss of dexterity.
- For how long?
- Afraid it'll be permanent.
"- Oh, my God."
- But your leg will be fine--
I don't care about my leg.
- Damn it.
really?
"well, you know that wink's gonna die, and you're gonna get promoted."
- i can't believe wink never promoted me.
he promised.
"baby, he promised."
- what a loser!
"you know, i thought, of all the losers in all the different trailer parks, that wayne was gonna be different."
"- he would've been, too, but behind every great man is a great woman."
- are you saying i ain't a great woman?
- you think it was better for him to buy you a harley than to go to college?
- it was for me.
"- oh, look around."
you really think that this was better for you in the long run?
- let me guess -- that's me in the box.
i ain't afraid of dying.
- look around.
funeral parlor's pretty empty.
- so?
it's not like i'd be around to care.
"though, actually, i did think wayne might be here."
he was pretty good about obligations.
- wayne died a year ago.
saw a commercial for i.t.t. technical college and began crying so hard his throat done closed up and couldn't get no more air.
strange occurrence.
suffocated to death.
- hmm.
see?
look.
somebody loves me.
here comes bob.
"he's always good about obligations, too."
"- i have laid awake many a night, thinking to myself,"
Indeed.
"The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass."
Now it will guide us to your land.
"Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass."
"Once we get it, steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way."
How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
All I need is a ride back.
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
Then we'd better start climbing.
Right.
So...
(Chuckles)
I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders.
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, milady."
(Whooshing tinkle) I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
So... which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?
Hmm?
Go on.
Fight it out.
"Don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
"(Horns blare in distance, indistinct conversations)"
(Horn honks)
(Door squeaks)
(Clanks)
(Engine starts)
(Engine revving)
(Shifts gears)
Impressive.
I'll give you back your man-goggles.
Here.
"I just thought we might run into some cute boys on the way home, but it's probably best we didn't."
That's a pretty angry lip you got there.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Wow.
Does everybody's get this red?
"Well, you had quite a bit of growth."
"I was gonna have that lady take a crack at your arms, but she had already sweat through her apron."
"Oh, my gosh!"
I already have 100 likes on my picture of my new nails.
"Um, FYI, I'm..."
"I'm sort of in the background there, screaming mid-wax."
400 people liked this photo.
I was not one of them.
"My art teacher made a pithy ""blue period"" comment, and my top prom prospect suddenly found a girlfriend in Canada."
Do you think I could get my sneakers back?
"Ohh, I threw them away with the rest of your clothes when you were in the changing room."
"I thought about saving them for the housekeeper, but I couldn't remember if she had a son."
"Look, I've tried really hard to put up with a lot since..."
What's going on?
"Oh, I just had so much fun with you!"
We don't do this enough.
I just wish there was something that you could teach me.
Uh-huh.
"Wait, what about your Judo stuff?"
Uh you're not interested in that.
No!
No!
I am!
Come on!
"- Tom, cab."
- Oh!
"And if that ginger viper so much as gets her nose through the office door while we're out, you're sacked."
And don't think I won't know.
I can smell her shaving cream on the wind.
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up!"
I heard furniture.
"""Angels of the Sea."
Across the Waves.
Two to Dunkirk.
Three to Dunkirk.
Dunkirk or Bust.
"Busts to Dunkirk."""
Somewhere in the world there is a bullet with that man's name on.
Why hasn't he been called up?
"I mean, Parfitt's too old, but Buckley--"
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war effort with a typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in uniform, like every other mother's son."
"That is, if he ever had a mother."
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub, spawning spontaneously in the sawdust."
"You know, a lot of men are scared we won't go back into our boxes when this is all over."
It makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
- What's this?
- Lunch.
"The girls can pilot the boat home, all right?"
You have left me crippled
"Jagadish, my son..."
"Mamma, where have Uncle Jai and Uncle Jagadish gone away?"
"They have gone out for a while, they're going to be back"
Don't lie to the child
"Om... my son, this house is rooted on rock-solid foundation"
Jai and Jagadish will be back.
Surely
Only if we have this house.
What does that mean?
"As of now, this house belongs to Shekhar Malhotra"
What...?
- I borrowed forJai's education
Then I couldn't repay.
Now he has claimed this house
Joys you have always shared
Will you keep your sorrows to yourself?
Why...?
Because he is Om and he wishes to become a god among men
"High time that you thought about yourself, my son"
When must we leave this house?
Tomorrow morning
"Rita, they're married."
Let them take their decisions in life
Like her decision about getting married
"Mamma, I'm happy I married Jai."
- Great!
I'm elated
Your mother will never change
Work with their research teams?
Give up my claim to my design?
Then don't.
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted everybody out."
I know where he is.
He's hiding out.
Know what I'm sayin'?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
"That way they got nothing, uh?"
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go down to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Wherever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again I don't wanna go any place that's cold."
You don't have a choice.
"Ed, come on."
Whoever fucking controls it just no place cold.
Do that for me.
"He's bronchial, that's why."
If he's legitimately bronchial we may take that into consideration.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"You mean to tell me if something happens to my parents and they get sick, I can't see them?"
Maybe something could be worked out if they're sick.
"If there's extraordinary circumstances-- l can't do this. I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Karen, I told you before."
Where you been?
- Heaven.
- Tell me where you been.
"What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?"
When'd you start wearing lipstick?
Where you been?
Tell me where you been and don't lie.
"Don't tell me you been at Tina's, 'cause your mother already colluded on that lie and I'm not buying it."
"- I don't have to lie to you, I don't have to tell you anything."
- You're dating that nigger again.
"- Yeah, I don't date niggers, Dad, I just fuck 'em."
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Yeah, what's wrong with me?"
- Somebody should put you away.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- She's got a mouth on her.
"I mean, the way she talks."
You know what I heard?
"That all teenage girls, they got, like, a hormonal imbalance, so no matter what you do, you know, you could smack 'em and smack 'em."
"beat the shit out of them, tell them right from wrong, it ain't gonna get through."
- That's true.
"She gonna be married in another year anyway, Horace."
Let some other guy smack her out.
"- Your people do that a lot, donât' they, George?"
- Say what?
- You smack the shit out of your kids.
"- Well, I just do what my daddy did, man."
- A teenage girl hates her father.
She's supposed to.
It's a biological imperative so she doesn't fuck her father.
I still haven't finished what I was saying.
President Choi's daughter has caused her father some trouble.
Her character is different from others.
"Yesterday, two female guards handed in their letter of resignation."
"The reason I came here is to protect the President, not the President's daughter."
"Hey, newcomer!"
Are you in charge here?
Do you think you can do whatever you want?
It's not that.
It's just that my dream is...
Stop talking about dreams!
Protecting the President's family is as important as protecting the President himself.
The training has been postponed to next year and it will be absolved by new employees.
"It's six months of training, and I will be the trainer."
Repeat after me.
One.
"You are entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
One.
"I'm entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
Second.
My function is to be a protective shield.
Second.
My function is to be a... protective shield.
Lee Yun Seong.
Lee Yun Seong.
Lee Yun Seong!
"I texted you several times, to ask for your bank account, but you didn't even reply once."
I said you don't need to.
That amount is just like the price of chewing gum for me.
"That's all you want to say, right?"
Wait...
"I don't know if I can chew that much gum, but please let me try to repay you, okay?"
To commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there.
Both of you.
Is that a program?
Yeah. and smile.
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.
Way ahead of you.
This graduation is a celebration for us too.
No more mean girls.
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.
"Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom."
J. wanna throw your hat in the ring?
What are you talking about?
Queen. what else is there to talk about?
The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year?
What would high school be without hierarchy?
Bearable?
a nice place to spend time?
Ladies.
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.
- What's going on?
- your minions were just telling me
About the search for the next queen.
They don't get to choose the next queen. i do.
"And take off that hideous scarf, penelope."
You can see if from space.
Not so fast j. don't waste your time appealing to blair.
We don't listen to her anymore.
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold
Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.
The new girl emma boardman transferring in next year.
Nice to meet you little j.
She said she saw them from the skylight.
"Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here."
"Yup, here we go."
This is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
Boom.
"So get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools."
And there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
Nelson was lying to his wife.
He also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
Maybe he had something going on the side?
"Confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements--"
- I want to know what else he was hiding.
- Done.
What are you working on?
The blood we found on Nelson's roof.
"I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human."
Take a look.
"Cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal."
It's a very large animal with claws and scales.
"The blood comes from an alligator, Mac."
Mr. Potato Head.
The live versision.
More like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato head as a boy.
I would time myself.
See how long it took to assemble him.
Some would say I was obsessed.
"You, obsessed?"
No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
Looks like some ki of jewelry.
It's an acupressure magnet.
You complain to the collector?
Face the consequences
The roads are in poor condition in our area
Why do you place the tar barrels at my door?
Didn't you ask for roads?

We are doing house warming today
All of you must come
I may not be able to come why don't you go and attend?
Mom said a senior like you should conduct the Pooja
OK we will come
Why do you look through a lens?
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
I have heard the cry of my brothers goin' down could not turn away
I could hear no other sound
I have watched the pain through my wounded eyes but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
and the anger of the night
I remember it so well beneath the midnight sun lord I walked the edge of hell kept all those memories in a wounded mind
but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
they say there's a reason
I'm told there is a rhyme but tell me who will answer who will pay this time
I was left with a wounded soul but I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore
I had to heal it
I had to heal it till I couldn't feel it anymore.
Michael Jefferson.
"And for your time, forty hours."
"Amount, 207."
"State tax, $17.00."
"Witholding tax, $32.25."
"Here you go, Michael."
"This week, there's a little raise."
You're a good worker.
I wish it could be more.
"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
"Hey, Mike, what's goin' on?"
"Hey, how you doin', John, buddy?"
"How about some coffee, man?"
Who's buyin'?
"Well, uh, I will, if, uh, you push this down to stall 34."
You're on.
I knew I could convince you.
"Mrs. Gower, a person may invite police officers into an apartment or residence... if that person has common right of entry, which you do, Mrs. Gower."
"You got any idea when he gets home, where he goes after work?"
"Not on Thursday, but on Wednesdays and Fridays, he's got some kind of a meeting, 8:00."
"Sometimes after work he comes home, falls asleep."
I knock on his door for him at 7.30.
[Saperstein] What kind of meeting?
Boy Scouts.
Who knows?
He's a quiet guy.
No trouble at all.
Saperstein.
Yeah.
Call the lieutenant.
Tell him to get in touch with a Dr. Irene Benton at this hospital.
"I'm going down to Hudson Hardware, get the owner and go through the place."
- Stake yourself out here.
"If Zucco shows, nail him."
- Okay.
Bobby.
"Danny first came here five months ago, Lieutenant."
- And the bombings started about a month later.
- But he's getting better in the group.
"In the beginning, the arguments, the violent emotions practically made him pass out."
"The others laughed at him, sympathized with him, attacked him."
"But they never excluded him, and that was the key."
Danny's not half as afraid of emotions anymore.
But he has got problems.
"Now, would you say that makes him a candidate for our bomber or not?"
"What do you think, Doctor?"
"I think you ought to question him on your own, Lieutenant."
I got a better idea.
- I think I'll join the group.
Silence!
I made a program for you and you decided not to follow it.
You defied my instructions and you went off course.
"Why are we being held to a different standard, Marcel?"
You weren't here on time this morning.
"I was here before sunrise, sadly, by myself."
"Therefore, I chose not to wait."
"Marcel, I've got to be honest with you."
You know...
Silence!
"No, you silence!"
"Please, just..."
"I don't need some speech about moments, okay?"
"No more, okay?"
"I'm sorry that we kept you waiting this morning and that we didn't respect your program, but last night my wife and I, we spent some real time together, and for the first time in a long time,"
"we woke up actually very, very happy."
"So, with all due respect, sir,"
"I don't need you, or anyone else for that matter, to, you know, say anything, really."
I know.
Sorry?
You do?
Yes.
That is why I am giving you this.
I don't understand.
I could never reveal your true inner animal spirit.
It was always up to you.
"Cynthia, Jason, your spirit is the rabbit."
"No matter what obstacles are put in front of him, the rabbit will scrape and burrow and find a way to create his home."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Lucy, Joseph."
"For you, the wolf."
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Should we drop the balloons?
"- No, no balloons."
- Maybe just drop half of them?
- No!
- Why do we even have balloons?
"Ma'am, I seriously overstepped the mark going out onstage."
That was a fuck-up.
"Yeah, I'll say."
You might want to watch that if you become president.
"If that does happen, want to be my veep?"
Why don't you go help them with the balloons?
Copy that.
[Woman] And now begins the ancient word.
"The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down."
"In the night, we make our feast."
"For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls."
"I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones."
"Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again."
"They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them."
"No boundaries, no borders."
"They will come for me, but I am coming for them."
"Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns."

"- How you doin', hot stuff?"
- Livin' the dream.
- How about yourself?
I have traveled to China on a merchant ship once.
Would you like to work as a navigator of our group?
"Yes, I will do my best if you'll hire me."
Same here.
I will build a brewery in Chunghae.
I need men to work at the brewery.
- Select the workers.
"- Yes, sir."
"If you work hard, you will be fed well and make money."
But I hate lazy men.
You will be fired the moment I catch you slacking off.
Hire the rest of them as our workers.
"Yes, sir."
We need to start trading in order to create more jobs.
And we need to wipe out the pirates in order to do that.
It will take more time to wipe out Yum Moon and the remaining pirates.
Grand Chief.
What is it?
The leader of the Palmi pirates has surrendered with his men.
My name is Pil-ryul.
We heard you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us into your care.
- You know Yum Moon?
- Yes.
Where is he?
I don't know where he is.
How could we trust them?
We can't show you our true mind.
We can't also make you trust us.
But we risked our lives to leave the base.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
Results?
As expected
I topped the college
Is this how you deliver great news?
Yes!
Why are you underplaying?
"I'm so happy, I could hug you!"
Get back to India right away
One more good news.
Tell me
An automobile giant has offered me a job.
It's about my project
I don't want to lose out on this opportunity
So returning home will be a bit difficult
You have bagged such a good offer and that's just as well
People with education go out to serve that country
I'd rather that you returned to serve your country
"Daddy used to say, lose your land, and you have lost everything"
"We ought to be together, Jai."
"Right now, I need you, Jai"
E-mail from Jai?
Jai has topped his college.
"Congratulations, son."
Bless you
"Enough of it, now come home."
For five years...
I have only seen you growing up in pictures.
Now I want to see you
"Om, why did it black out?"
"Broken connection, happens sometimes"
"Ma told me, at the end of the story... everything works out fine"
"If not, the story isn't over yet"
"Okay, here's our Taurus coming out of the Biltmore service garage."
We pick him up 50 yards away on a surveillance cam at Commerce Bank.
Valera's headed west.
We catch him on a traffic cam at this intersection.
We catch him on the library's weather cam.
Got the results back on that fabric swatch.
Blood's AB-negative.
Sara's O-positive.
It's not her blood.
So whose blood did Marcy bring us?
Run it through CODIS for DNA.
"Okay, there's Valera's starting point."
Let's roll it.
"Okay, we lose him here for a minute as he passes out of the CBD, but keep watching."
Looks like he's headed toward the 20.
Which puts him west toward Alabama.
Roll it back.
The weather cam time code puts them at the on-ramp at 7:22.
Now roll it back.
But this traffic cam puts him at the tunnel at 7:18.
So why did it take him so long to get to the on-ramp?
Traffic doesn't seem to be an issue.
Go full frame.
Keep your eyes on this SUV.
Freeze it!
The Taurus is right behind the SUV entering the tunnel.
"There's the SUV exiting, but where's the Taurus?"
The Taurus must have pulled over inside the tunnel.
That's our transfer point.
"If there was a handoff, both vehicles would've interrupted traffic flow."
That compare who's going in... with who's coming out.
"Other than Valera's Taurus, no interruption."
Who?
Who paid you?
Stop!
You're hurting me.
Who paid you?
Marzio.
Marzio!
Marzio Catalano?
The castle guard?
He's the one who cut the balcony palings.
I saw him leaving Don Francesco's room with a saw in his hand.
"I didn't understand what he was doing at the time... but when the lord died, he gave me some money..."
A lot.
So I wouldn't talk.
"Then, at the trial, he gave me some more."
"I didn't want to hurt Beatrice, or you... but I was afraid."
There was nothing else I could do;
he threatened me.
But who gave him the money?
Marzio doesn't have a penny.
That I do not know.
Ask him yourself.
"Having examined all the evidence... the court of Rome finds Beatrice Cenci guilty of the murder... of her father, Don."
"Francesco Cenci, Roman patrician, and decrees that she must pay for this unnatural crime with the death penalty."
"In light of her age, and as a sign of clemency... punishment by quartering, which is expected for patricide... has been commuted to a less painful death by decapitation."
There were two of them.
They shot me.
Then it was Giacomo.
He ordered you to cut the balcony palings.
He gave you the money to bribe Martina.
- He's a rogue.
"I've always been a faithful servant, and I would never betray him."
My career will be gone.
She is dead
Bad destiny is not an easy task
She was still alive
Even after knowing this you buried him alive
Do you have any proof?
I dont like writing stories
Who was that girl?
She was my daughter
She was my and Malika's daughter
Malika came in my life 26 years ago
But I did not marry her
For forever
Then how do you she is your daughter?
3 years ago I got an letter
Malika wrote that letter to Sheja when I was left I came to know Malika was pregnant
Then she had 2 daughters
Twins.
Where is your 2nd daughter?
You are my 2nd daughter
Its true
I'm telling you I have my parents I know you have parents but do you have any childhood picture with them?
Do you know in which hospital you were born?
May be your blood group is different from them
You are my daughter
And She is your twin daughter
Her face is not like me
You are twins but not the same face
People say twin's children can never be twins
You do mistake and we get punishment
You all 3 will get punishment
Since 3 years I'm collecting proofs for you
"Edie, you will help me?"
"You will tell them for me, yes?"
"Of course, Axel."
"This is my new and good friend Miss Morrow, from Beverly Hills."
"When I tell Edie what I want to do, she helps me."
What's happened is this:
Axel is selling his shop here and with it his highly honored trademark.
"The proceeds will go into a Hospital Fund, and I'm happy to tell you that the local church committee and others have pledged that they will match that amount dollar for dollar."
[Men grumbling]
"Boys, boys, what does this mean?"
You are afraid you lose your jobs?
You think Axel Norstaad would let this happen?
Of course not.
Now I will show you your new employer.
"Mr. Martin Somers of Long Beach, where he has big, big furniture factory."
"Mr. Somers, I introduce you around."
Tell your boss I just dropped in to--
Mr. Hadley.
We didn't expect to see you here.
I'm sure you didn't.
Losing bidders are supposed to go home and shut up.
"Hello, Hadley."
"Hello, Norstaad."
I gather it's all signed and delivered.
Sorry I gave you such a legitimate offer.
I don't know what you mean.
"It's nothing, Axel."
Everybody wanted your trademark.
"Mr. Hadley just needs a consolation drink, that's all."
It isn't me that needs the drink.
"Miss Morrow, you may be a very fine little promoter, but your knowledge of the furniture business--"
"You just say those things to me, Hadley."
- Then you better hope
Gallo doesn't leave her a message the same way he left me one.

"Staring out the window, Louis?"
That's a sign that something's going on.
"Nothing's going on, Rachel."
Then why exactly did you make Brian Altman relive that horrible day?
- Which horrible day?
- The one where you treated him like shit because you were losing your mind.
That day.
You want to know what's going on?
I'm being sued.
That's what's going on.
- By Brian?
"- No, by Stephanie."
For sexual harassment?
"Louis, this is bad."
"- I know what it is, Rachel."
"- Well, then we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"No, we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"Louis, that's not a good idea."
It's the only good idea.
You need to go over there right now and put an end to this.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
"Because I had a run-in with Stephanie after you did, and then I had another run-in with her after Donna fired her."
She's not gonna listen to me.
"It is sexual harassment, Rachel."
I cannot have it on my record.
"Someone needs to convince her to let this go, and it needs to be a lawyer I can trust, but it also needs to be someone who's close to her level, or she's gonna feel attacked."
Then I think I have the perfect choice.
She must be really pretty?
Who does she look like?
She doesn't really look like anyone.
Hmm...
What kind of person is she?
- Hmmm.
Like a fairy?
- Fairy?
"Ah, no, well."
"Calling her a fairy is a bit of an exaggeration, but, like she's out of reach?"
"After meeting her, I thought nothing else would do for me."
Many things happened before reaching this point.
Hmm..
"But, you know."
"Confessing one week before Christmas, and instantly ""Ok""."
"That girl broke up with her boyfriend right before that, right?"
"Well, yes."
"Since she became alone just before the event, it feels like she just went along with it for the time being."
Are you fine with that?
"If you put it like that, I have my selfish calculations too."
I told her then because I knew about her situation.
I see.
I know about it all.
But it's okay.
"Anyway, because Saeko-san is my girlfriend now."
You've become really good at tempering.
You don't even need a thermometer.
- I can just tell by how the texture feels.
"Its heaviness changes according to its temperature, right?"
"Alright, right now its 28 degrees."
"Ever since I was a kid, I vaguely thought I would probably continue with the family cake shop, it wasn't something I took seriously."
I found how I wanted to shape my life after meeting Saeko-san.
"Mondale and Ferraro, path to equality."
"No, thanks."
"What are you, a Republican?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, did you catch it from your parents?"
I hear it's hereditary.
I guess I did.
"Well, if you don't want a pamphlet, here, have a pin, on me."
"I might wear it, but only because it's stylish."
"You know, if you're not a pamphlet reader, I could take you to coffee tell you all about why Mondale and Ferraro are gonna lose."
"If you're so sure they're gonna lose, why bother?"
"I don't know, it feels right."
So... coffee?
KIRSTEN:
I guess I had fate on my mind when I got you this gift.
Where on Earth did you find this?
I turned the house upside down.
"If it hadn't been for Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, there never would have been a Seth Cohen."
There wouldn't be a Ryan.
And whoever this is going to be...
All because of that one day.
My lucky day.
My lucky day.
"Okay, I admit it-- I put way too much stock into that poem."
I'm not the girl that you thought I was.
You're not.
"You, Summer, are better."
"See, back then you were just this fantasy."
"You were this little girl, who, when I would see, you would either ignore me, or make an obscene gesture and keep on walking."
"Yeah, I kind of remember that, sorry."
But now look at you.
You fight for sea otters.
You've befriended Taylor Townsend.
Eh?
- Ah!
Talk to the manager.
- Eh?
"Say I'm your friend or something, anyway, do some negotiation."
"If you do, I'll give you this."
Also.
- What else?
Is that guy new?
"Ah, he's a recently joined apprentice."
I don't think the tempering is going well.
"No one seems to be checking it,"
I think it should be redone.
- You can tell by looking from here?
I can tell.
"Ah, he's here."
Eh?
"Wrapped up in the fragrance of chocolate, without good or bad feelings, she pops in my head."
"A chocolate that all the passion is poured into, like an extension of my own being,"
I want her to hold it in her mouth.
I want it to pour into her body.
"These kinds of dirty aspirations, brought me all the way here."
Saeko-san.
I will definitely become a chocolatier.
No matter how many years it takes.
I will become a chocolatier that everybody acknowledges.
"I will become famous enough to stay in your mind, to make you think ""I shouldn't have abandoned him back then""."
I will make you regret it.
"And then, after stealthily eating my chocolate, you will say ""C'est bon""."
That's my dream.
"Even if that voice,"
never reaches my ears.
Now that Samm...
"Now that my brother has gone, I must find something with which to occupy myself."
I've responsibilities.
Dependents.
I've decided that to continue with the agency.
"I understand, Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film?"
The role of an inebriated uncle.
No!
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother I would say, ""What have you got to lose by being honest Sammy?"""
"Explain to the man, he's 63."
Not 36.
"And that he's pre-flown to fame is ""Inspector Chamfold""."
Chamforth.
Inspector Chamforth.
Please be calm Mr.Hilliard.
I'm perfectly calm.
What you're seeing is controlled anger tempered with ice headed detachment.
This is one of the many subtle emotions which a good actor is capable of.
Three weeks and location Devon.
Followed by three in a London studio.
There are currently only nine films in pre-production with the studios.
None of the others hold a role for you.
"I hope I share some of my brother's qualities, Mr.Ambrose. I do not however share his sentimental attachments."
I'll not keep un-profitable clients on the books.
Veal.
Twice please.
Oh!
And some veal pudding?
Excellent choice.
Too long.
Lose half.
Which half?
There were nights
I remember them
I will carry them till the end of my days
On the way
Between Deganiya and Kinneret
Stood the loaded cart of my life
He came up to me and said:
"Listen to me, little one"
I built a house for you
In the evening you'll embroider a shirt for me
By day I will drive your cart
What's wrong?
I had a dream about Zeltzer.
Who's Zeltzer?
"Zeltzer, the lighting guy."
He worked for years in the theater.
I wonder if he still works there.
I dreamt that Zeltzer turned the spotlight on my pants.
And I insist that I want it only on my shoes.
And he insists that the audience won't be able to see it.
"And I repeat: ""Only the shoes, not the pants."""
He gets mad and says that no one will see the shoes.
"So I pull him off the ladder and go up there myself, turn the light only on his shoes, but he walks away, leaving me alone."
Suddenly I see Mommy walking on the chairs.
Floating.
Then she comes up to me and lifts me in the air.
"""Direct me, direct me."""
I tell her that first I want to turn the spotlight on her shoes.
"She stands under the ladder,"
I turn the spotlight and she says:
"""Will you direct me?"
"""Will you direct me?"""
* When you taught me
* What my heart
* Was made for
* I got what I prayed for
* You're

"And so, my dear duchess."
"Tomorrow, I may be in possession of the city and its treasures."
- A theatrical titan.
"- Not really, Commodore."
Success is in my very grasp.
- Confounded flies.
- Tell me about it.
I have invested practically everything I have in a theatrical venture which is certain to make millions.
"Millions, duchess."
"Do you know, Commodore, since you've called me duchess when others address me as Mrs. Schultz."
I positively shudder.
"Yes, I can understand that."
"Now, as I was saying..."
But let's not talk anymore of money.
There are so many more important things.
- Name one.
"- Well, happiness."
There are times when I feel I could trade all my wealth for just a sip from the cup of dreams.
"For a cottage, small, by a waterfall."
You're so understanding.
"Uh, tell me, what is your opinion of the privileges of love?"
- I'm in favor of them.
- I mean..
Do you think a woman in love is privileged to speak her mind?
How can you stop them from doing it?
Or you have to destroy someone else.
"If she hadn't busted her knee, I wouldn't be here."
You don't feel bad about taking her place?
"By the time she left, I think she was done."
"I mean, she didn't say that, but she started partying, not caring as much."
She was ready to go.
I have a friend who seems like he's doing the same thing.
Then maybe it's time for him to go.
"Look, I know it's harsh, but that's this world and this city."
It's kill or be killed.
And I don't just want to survive.
I wanna thrive.
That's very Darwinian.
That's right.
It's the most natural thing in the world.
So you can't feel bad about it.
Amelia was right.
"To make it in this city, you have to let your animal instincts take over."
"And in that moment,"
I knew I was going to write this piece and thrive.
So you don't mind if I ask you a couple more questions?
Of course.
And there's nothing you want me to take off the record?
Nah.
This world is so screwed up.
Let people see it.
Wow.
You got her to reveal so much.
Turns out we had a lot in common.
"Well, I'm terribly glad this ended up on your desk."
I don't think anyone else could have written this but you.
- Well done.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
"It's weird how something has to happen sometimes, , , to see how you actually feel about something,"
"Sit down, M r."
"Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"I n that case it was true, but..."
"Oh, you're never like me, dear Elinor."
Look how calmly you take the news.
He opened his heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
"It came out quite unawares, quite without design."
I could talk of nothing but my child.
"He gave way to his feelings and he told me of his earnest, tender, constant affection for Marianne."
Everybody knows Colonel Brandon to be an excellent man.
Excellent?
"Oh, my dear, he remained constant throughout that business with Willoughby and he brought me here."
- Any man might do as much for love.
"- Oh, Elinor, do you now belittle him?"
On the contrary!
I am saying that what makes him so fine a gentleman is his constant goodness to everybody.
I have offered heartfelt thanks for all he has done.
"Oh, thanks are not enough."
One must help good causes along.
I have told him that Marianne will be well enough to see him tomorrow.
Whose idea was this?
"Mother's, I suppose."
You must thank him.
I mean to.
He is a worthy man.
"But worthy men are so uninteresting, especially men of his age."
And letting him see me in this state...
- You look lovely.
- My skin looks terrible.
"You are romantically pale, like the heroine of one of Mrs Radcliffe's novels."
"- Hmm, yes."
I see what you mean.
- (LAUGHS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Good morning, Colonel."
There's paint over here too.
"Doc,give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint,rubber tiles... oh,my God."
Playground turf.They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change,and he'Il tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
"Wait.How is it that you caught up with this guy,but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
- Surprise me.
- We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
- And Petty?
- He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means,but the turf..."
- what color was the paint?
- The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
What color was the paint?
Her son was on the football team.
Good for him.
I'm not sure if it's good.
Okay.
Have you been drinking?
At work?
Of course not.
"Although, since my day has been extremely trying,"
I am gonna have a drink now.
"Yeah, well, my day has been no picnic, either, so... how about I join you?"
Sure.
Just completely infuriating how some people are... so...
Treacherous?
It's like one of-- one of our investors.
"He's-- he's one of those people that's like a-- like a virus, the kind that mutates, metastasizes into a cancer."
"Yeah, how do you get rid of people you want to get rid of?"
You redouble your efforts.
Why don't we ever do this?
What?
Drink together.
Because I'm always standing here and you're always in the kitchen.
"No, I mean-- I don't mean like that."
I mean-- why don't we ever talk?
- Aside from every day?
"- No, I mean--"
I mean really talked or... make love.
"Libby, we-- we've been married a very long time."
"Yes, we have."
God knows I'm not talking about fireworks.
"But if you were dying and you had one final moment to... look back at your whole life, at the things that mattered the most to you... what would you say about our marriage?"
"Well, we tried our best."
Both of us.
But too tempting to pass up.
Argh!
I'll bet that smarts.
"But you know what they say - no pain, no gain."
"Bravo, Goliath."

A warm body is all it takes to activate the automated mechanisms in any one of these rooms.
"Without one of these to deactivate the rooms, anyone caught in there would be bouncing off the walls forever."
Mace!
Check out the screen.
Where's Goliath?
Not to worry.
He must be in one of the adjoining rooms.
- This... this makes no sense.
- (alarm sounds)
- Now what?
- It's the security alarm.
Impossible.
No one could navigate his way around the rooms like that.
Unless...
The key you dropped!
Somehow the gargoyle must have found it.
It's allowing him to pass unharmed from room to room.
"At this rate, he'll be out in minutes."
"Oh, man!"
"This dose was much stronger, so expect to feel worse tomorrow."
Thanks for coming.
How's things?
very busy.
So let's stick to the real reason why you asked me here.
You said it was important.
I need you to loan me your share of the estate.
"I'll repay you in two years, with interest."
"I need you to help me, Nik."
Help you what?
Sort out your debts or have you found another sure-fire investment that can't lose?
I made a bad mistake with the cars.
I was tempted and I succumbed.
It was a mistake.
I admit it.
But I am tying to right that error.
Can't you see that?
I need you to believe me on this.
That requires faith that I just don't have.
There isn't anyone else I can ask.
What do you want me to do?
"I need you to just sign the papers from the solicitor, approving the release of your share of the will."
I see.
"You've made all the arrangements already, have you?"
I will pay you back.
"I'd really appreciate it, Nik."
I'll think about it.
Do you have to go so soon?
"Yeah, I've got a lot to do."
You're more interested in dead people than the living!
At least the dead don't lie.
We'd like to take a sample of your DNA.
"First of all,his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted proctor to suffer the most.
Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim,it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to tony torrell's wife.
- How you doing?
- Uh...
I'm fine.
"Uh,i'm here to see agent rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
"If someone were following me right now,"
"Do you really think they could stop me from, say, uh,"
Breaking your neck?
"If I didn't care about getting caught, that is, and..."
I don't.
"Look, I get it."
"You and the people you work with,"
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
You'll be watching pretty little jenny
And you'll be watching pretty little me.
So maybe it'll be her.
Maybe it'll be someone else.
The important thing is is that devalos knows
About all this ahead of time.
"That way, if he doesn't step up,"
The girl I find...
Who to?
Admiral Jackson is in command of the squadron blockading Rochefort.
"Sail Defiant to Rochefort, is that what you're asking?"
"Sail her up to the squadron, alongside English men-of-war?"
"Yes, I am asking you to do that if you care for the safety of your country."
If you don't wish to see her humiliated and overrun by Frenchmen.
"- Well, what will become of us?"
- How can I promise anything?
Their lordships at the Admiralty do not encourage mutiny.
- It was never intended this way.
"- What way, then?"
A petition?
I see.
Bit late for petitions now.
"All right, we'll sail to Rochefort."
"- Lf we do, will you stand by us?"
- I'll do my best for you.
All of you.
I'll submit all the facts in your favour.
But I warn you if any harm comes to a single officer...
A single officer.
I understand.
"Very sorry you lost the arm, sir."
He's promised to speak for us when the time comes.
Can we trust him?
"What, trust an officer?"
- To hell with England!
- I've got a family back home!
I don't want Frenchmen tramping through my house.
"Sergeant, watch him."
All our lives depend on this.
"For the present, we're agreed."
It was recently brought to my attention that I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
Honest question.
Do you think I'm a cynic?
Honest answer?
Absolutely.
You're Miss Possible But Not Likely.
About my own life?
Of course.
"But watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?"
"I mean, look at them."
Have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
Not in a while.
"Amanda, you said we need to talk."
Right.
You didn't think I meant-
Maybe a little.
After a few people weighed in.
The one time you didn't take my words literally.
Did you really think my feelings had changed?
Is that why you brought me here?
"I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you."
But no one was actually asking you.
That's why my feelings for you could never change.
Didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
Only for you.
You have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom- Save your excuses!
Your flight leaves in less than two hours.
My flight- You heard me.
But you haven't heard her.
You have nothing to say in the matter!
But I do!
Yeah.
Quick there and back.
No leftovers-
- I will be there to cut the turkey.
"I know, I know."
There's my cab.
Love you.
I'll just be another minute.

One very fast elevator.
Hey.
"Ellie, he's adorable."
"Aw, thanks."
"Jake Malloy, this is the amazing Abby."
- Oh.
"Uh, I-I could've guessed."
Just let me assure you that I am informed of everything you do
"It was Corbett, wasn't it?"
"Now, don't try and change the subject, Merle."
I would like an explanation.
What exactly did you think you were doing?
- Eloping.
- Ha ha ha.
"Well, we'll forget all that romantic nonsense for now."
But your Mr. Danny Pierce can consider himself fortunate if I don't have him arrested.
How did you know his na--
Why can't I get married?
Because you are still a child.
I'm nearly 21.
"I wasn't referring to birthdays, Merle."
"Some girls are ready for marriage at that age, but others, like yourself--"
Well... what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid that you should never get married.
You're--
You're just not well enough.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
But it's better to face it now.
There will always be unscrupulous men after your money.
No.
Not Danny.
I'm afraid so.
"I'm having him investigated, and I'm sure we will find he's nothing but a cheap fortune hunter."
That's not true.
You're lying.
Now that's enough of that kind of talk out of you.
You'll go to your room immediately.
"For punishment, you wanted to wear Grandmother's diamonds to the party."
I'm afraid that's out of the question.

"Now, does anyone wanna guess how old the White House is?"
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.
That's very accurate.
Construction began in 1792 on what was then called the President's House.
"Now, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution set forth that a district of no more than 1O miles square should house the new seat of government."
Does anyone know why?
So no one state could claim the President's House.
Right again.

"If it's such a good fake, how can you tell it's fake?"
"Felt a little heavy in my hand, so I weighed it."
"Ends up it's 34 centigrams over specs, which only allow for a seven centigram variance margin."
You could tell this was 34 centigrams heavy just by holding it?
So happens I could.
Why are you being such a hater?
You know how little 34 centigrams is?

- Let there...
- We mustn't!
Froaude!
"Colonel Froaude, if you must kill the hostages to completely conquer Estabul then I'll persuade them."
"The people, the soldiers..."
I'll get them to follow Roland!
What are you saying?
I think that will be far more effective than killing the hostages and ruining Estabul's reputation.
Indeed.
You are quite popular with the people of Estabul.
You gents have come up with a beaut.
Might even work it into my show.
This was the murder weapon.
"My constable found it at your old campsite, the one you were staying at the night of the murder."
Why did you move campsites?
I move whenever I want.
It's the beauty of a home on wheels.

Might be... might not be.
But I doubt you can prove I ever touched that thing.
So if I'm the murderer... show me the evidence that'll hang me.
I didn't have enough to hold him in custody.
The only person who knows what happened that night is Fen.

"[Newscaster] In Washington, the size ofthe crowds... have swelled to overa quarter ofa million demonstrators... protesting the ongoing war in Vietnam."
"There must be a quarter million ofthem out there, Edgar."
"You know, they've been at it nowfor a whole year."
"Young kids, just like Tricia."
I don't know.
"Do you think they gota point, Edgar?"
This whole damn system of government.
"Rememberwhat Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President,"
"""The powerwas lying in the streets, waiting for someone to pick it up."""
The Communists have never been closerthan they are now.
Now's the time to get back to the old themes.
The ones that made you president.
Letthe Communists know you're onto them.
Those bastards.
Think they can ruin Tricia's wedding... by dancing naked in the reflecting pool.
"Well, don't listen to them and don'tquit."
"Remember, Kennedy and King were against the war."
Where are they now?

Howthe hell the Times gota hold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace.
Yeah.

"Well, her arms and legs seem to function all right."
"Well, then there's no brain damage or muscle paralysis."
"Well, Dad, I don't know about brain damage."
Something's happened to Judy.
"Paula, you sure you're not imagining things?"
"Dad, I swear to you, I am not imagining anything."
And I think Judy's suffering from amnesia.
"Now, what can I do?"
"All right, Paula, I'll tell you what to do."
Take Judy back to the clinic and do a complete diagnostic work-up on her.
"Take her pulse, blood pressure, uh, respiration readings."
"Do an EKG, an EEG, and you can X-ray both arms and legs."
"And if she's still out of sorts you can give her a mild sedative, ok?"
"Marsh, is all that really necessary?"
"Oh, no, of course not."
I just want to keep her occupied.
"Uh, Paula, you sound as if you're having kind of a bad case of nerves."
"Dad, my nerves are perfectly calm."
"Now, there's something wrong with Judy."
She's a different chimp.
"Honey, she probably just wants some attention."
She's not faking.
She is sick.
She's very sick.
"All right, honey."
All right.
"Take Judy back to the clinic, and do as I told you."
Are you sure you feel up to it?
"Yes, Dad, I'll do anything to help her."
- Anything.
"- Ok, honey."
Paula and her instant diagnosis.
"And Ágika increasingly better enthused into dreaming about the major, the major changed to increasingly more attractive one  and resembled hers father increasingly better."

Just as stately.

He carries the paper money out in his pocket into little dumplings.
Rolls a bullet there only if it is necessary to pay

"Assuming that Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, then I'd never reveal anything he said to me."
"Even Americans, I suppose, find it sometimes desirable to betray a confidence."
Let's get some things straight here.
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.
"I somehow got involved in this very unfortunate incident, and I came here to make a simple statement of fact and not be subjected to a police grilling."

"You could've done what you did quietly, but you didn't."

We'II start taking statements.
"I'm Gary Racine, Detective Sergeant provincial police."
"Jacques PIante, also Detective Sergeant."
We'II take your statements.
They mentioned 4 witnesses...
including him?
"No, it's..."
Josée Morin.
She's still in there with the doctor.
- Detective Sergeant Racine.
"- Yes, yes..."
We mustn't talk too loud.
"It's not good for her, even if she's sedated."
You gave her some...
Sedatives?
"Yes, yes."
I had no choice.
She's in a terrible state of shock.
But did she talk to you?
Yes.
She had a very bad night.
She can't remember...
"The way she speaks isn't very coherent, but I still managed to get a few bits of information on what happened."
"First of all... one, she's a woman who was at the hotel and who was having drinks with some... alcohol, and who suffered a terrible shock, which would have been preceded by a perturbation of an emotional nature... which was followed by a sort of blackout."
"But she will recall some elements, always the same ones."
I have noted that.
really?
Which ones?
That she found herself in this bedroom.
"Then... that her right cheek was tumefied,"
"That's class, eh?"
Not even lost her appetite!
"The best for you, my gem."
My black gem.
I'm not a black gem.
I live like my mom did.
"In expensive clothes, in luxury, in flesh, without pleasure."
"But it would be good to find somebody that loves me, a husband, just like in real life."
"The Venom family, you know there are four of them?"
I'll make Ancient Mariners out of them.

So your 43 boob dollars are gonna get us to Texas?
Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.
Sweaty but ready.
"All right, can y'all folks lock up?"
I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.
My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.
I got to talk to him about removing it.
"Caroline,"
New Orleans is close to Texas.
"The Hamburglar says so on my McDonald's placemat, and he would never lie unless it's about stealing delicious hamburgers."
I'm confused.
Do you want hamburgers or do you wanna take that riverboat?
"Obviously, the dream scenario is both."
"Ah, thank you very much."
"Max, people have tickets."
You have to pay to get on this... what I'm positive will be my sixth near-death experience.
So bend over and unclench.
We need those butt quarters.
Who are you?
My mother at a church carnival?
"Have your tickets ready, please."
All we have to do is act like we belong.
Do I at least get to have an adorable Southern accent?
No accent.
"Well, I do declare that is mighty disappointing."
Just follow my lead.
It's time to touch strangers.
"Hey, you got a permit for those guns?"
"Well, I say, you got a permit for that light-up yo-yo?"
I have a girlfriend.
"Keep walking, buster."
"Max, the riverboat doesn't get to New Orleans for two days and we have nowhere to sleep."
Go away.
"Doctor, we are terribly sorry, but we aren't doing it out of spite."
We don't have it easy either.
Such research is so terribly demanding.

You should take a rest.
Do you also rest sometimes?
-Only in critical situations.

"Well, actually it's a secret."
But we can show it to you.

-Six.

-Fasten your seat belt and no smoking.
How many times do I have to remind you?
Doctor!
Doctor?
-Are you here?
Hallo!
Are you worried about that?
Yes
I will give in writing that I have sold it
You give in writing that you have purchased it
"That is right, you give in writing Have this"

Ah!
this is a brick
- Useless fellow
- Why this?
- For being a fool
If you have spent Rs 5000 usefully I can understand
But you have purchased a brick for Rs 5000
Are you trying to assault me?
"stay there stay there, you fool"
He is dead
I used to walk through streets with fear
Never knew when a decayed egg or acid filled egg will be thrown at
Now I come very peacefully All this is because of your son

You should be very proud as Arul's father
-Aunty
-How are you?
What do I lack?
Your son looks after me very well
How are you uncle?
You are just 4 streets away Can't you come to our house once?
"A street prophet, if you will."
I got to change microphones.

- I gotta fix the mike.
It'll just take a second.
I gotta get that...
Back off!
"Back off, will you!"
That's dangerous!
"Get-Get down, you stupid little nothing!"

I don't believe this.
"This is Frank Smuntz, Channel 12 San Diego Evening News... riding in the thick of the police high-speed chase."

Miss Voss!
Can you give us a thumbs-up if you're okay?
"- Right here, pal."
- Can we show that on TV?
"Uh, Frank?"
Frank?
"Um, it appears we've lost our feed there from Frank Smuntz... riding right alongside that speeding BMW."
- Lolly.
"- Thanks, Steve."
I think before we continue we should take a moment to apologize to our viewers... for that obscene gesture you just saw coming from the window of that speeding car.
Yes.
"That's the risk we take with live TV, isn't it, Lolly?"
That's right.
We'll be back with more live coverage... of Kidnapped At 100 Miles Per Hour... after these messages.
"Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends."
Do you have a nice place to write?
"I mean, that's important."
"You'll find that, if you haven't already."

Does it work for you?
"No, not really."
"In fact, I rarely go."
Here.
"I probably wouldn't have wanted to hear this either when I was your age, but..."
The city.
You can't get anything done here.
"It has a creative energy, but not a productive energy."
"Quiet does not exist, and I find that difficult."
"Do you know, I've not written a single page within the city limits these past 30 years?"
"You'll need a country retreat, if you can afford one."
I can't.
(CHUCKLES)
Well...
"Of course, I had achieved considerably more than you by now."
- Not to be insulting.
- Of course.
"But if I can be of any assistance, if I can help in any way, just ask outright."
Don't be shy.
I loved your book.
"- Yeah, it was OK."
- Don't denigrate yourself.

And I think you know why.
This is going great.
About as well as I expected.
"Okay, all right."
"Okay, it's obvious you two have some history, but can we just take a step back and focus on my problem?"
Didn't mean much
We were hungry but we could not be fed
Radio blasting
Silly little love songs
We only listened for the beat
Taking our chances
Out there on the mean streets
Hiding in the shadows from the heat
From the heat
We weren't lovers
Just brave strangers
As we fought and we tumbled through the night
We were players
Not arrangers
And we jammed till the dawn's early light
Swimming in the big lake
Taking it easy
Taking any comfort we could find
Didn't need the real truth
Didn't need the meaning
Straight ahead ignoring every sign
Every sign
"And, oh, i remember"
I know you do too
"Oh, that one evening"
I know you do too
The moon flying high
[Chorus] The moon flying high
- And you took my hand
- Ooh
Ooh-ooh
You took my hand

"Hello, Lena."
"These drones are gonna put us out of work, Joan."
Have you spoken with Annie recently?
She doesn't work in my division anymore--you know that.
"Well, I'm sure you know she applied for a transfer out of the D.P.D."
And yesterday she filed for a week off.
"- She has vacation days, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
Many.
"Well, that's what they're there for--vacation."
I'm sure she just needed to recharge her batteries.
"In all the time I've known Annie, she's never been one in need of recharging."
"If she needs the time off, just give her her space."
"Look, right there."
"Joan, maybe we'll hang on to our jobs after all."
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you know where Annie is?
"No idea, Joan."
"Look, I know it's not my place to give you advice, but I'd ease up on the micromanaging."
"In my experience, operatives only rise as high as you let them."
You're right.
It's not your place to give me advice.
Sorry for the wait.
"I was briefing the commissioner about what we found on Jai's murder, which is still not a hell of a lot."
"Well, that's why I'm here, sir."
"Well, then why were you staring?"
It was hard to miss.
"Trust me, Salvadore is the least of our problems."
It's freezing in here.
Why would they make a room like this?
You should have seen my masseuse.
She was so hot.
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.
Why do you think I wanted to get a full release?
You know what?
I don't even want to get into this with you.
Into what?
I don't want to get into this conversation with you.
Why is that?
"Because I don't want to be put in a position where l,d have to lie."
Why are you getting all high and mighty on me?
"No, I'm not so high and mighty."
"Joey, I'm not judging you,"
I'm just not asking anything because
I don't want...
I don't want to know.
"Because that way, if someone asks me..."
You won't have to rat me out.
I would never rat you out.
Of course I wouldn't't rat you out.
"Right, right."
"But this way, I don't have to make that decision because I really don't know."
"All right, let me ask you something, then."
"Could you honestly say that after seven years together, that you get turned on by the same woman?"
I do.
Without going to the highlight reel.
You're playing a verbal shell game.
Shall we get going?
- Give me a quick briefing.
- The nursery had 70100 employees.
"Now it's threatened with closure, and has debts of several million."
Thank you.
- Is anything wrong?
"- No, no."
- Lebech has withdrawn from Ussing.
- Has Ussing commented on that?
He's probably about to.
I don't comment on rumours.
Would you like to hear our job creation policies?
- It's a storm in a teacup.
"- Yes, but as I said..."
The organisers are asking us to answer a few extra questions.
What do you say?
As long as we talk job creation reform and government abusing the benefit law.
- You can borrow mine.
- Thank you.
I'll just run through it with my advisor.
It's a crude game you're playing.
"If you think you can sneak a win, with rumours from an unreliable witness, you must be really desperate."
- There's more than just a witness.
"- I'll explain myself, don't worry."
You prepare yourself for a libel suit.
- It's all right by us.
- Good.
Anders was called back to Christiansborg to help the police.
"- Unfortunately, it couldn't wait."
- What a shame.
No comment.
Now he wants them to solve an old case.
"Yeah, and who are they to say we can't carve out our slice of the American dream, huh?"

None of your business.
What is your business is Vernon.
"And apparently, you didn't take care of business very well."
"- I'm sorry, come again?"
- I didn't come a first time.
You said you had Vernon under control.
Do you know he converted his endorsement money into ownership in a grow house?
Ownership?
"That's something I know something about, Joe."
"Uh, I have no idea why they think that would be okay."
It's totally unacceptable.
"I appreciate your concurrence, Joe."
Tell your client I'm cutting him.
"Boys, knock it off!"
( gasps )
Hey.

I'm gonna share something with you and I hope you will be as supportive of me as I've been of you this morning.
Kisan Teague has the kind of talent that can take our offense over the top and finally turn the negativity around.

We'll come and get you when we're done.
It's Jesse.
Just-- just please try to be careful.
Some of this stuff is really valuable.
Yeah?
Hope it's bulletproof.
"Come on, Schmidt."
Open up.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Bad news, Sam."
"When I was picking up rounds, I paid a neighborhood kid to ride his bike by Maddy's house, just to make sure everything was okay."
He said the garden rake's propped up against the garage.
She gave the meeting signal?
Why'd she give the meeting signal?
"I don't know, Sam."
It's a rake.
It didn't come with subtitles.
"If you think someone might be following you, the temptation is to drive erratically."
"It may force the tail to reveal itself, but it also reveals you're onto them."
A better approach is to drive very conservatively.
Go below the speed limit and linger at stop signs.
"You won't win any fans on the road, but it'll help you lose your tail."
"If they think you're simply an overcautious driver, it'll catch them off guard when you suddenly take a risk."
"Oh, thank -- thank God."
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
"Well, we, uh..."
we've been busy.
We got the signal late.
Yeah.
That's the problem with communicating by garden tools.
What's going on?
Olivia Riley paid me a visit.
"Warm regards, nigga."
"O.G. Stinkmeaner."""
"By the way, you're not exactly the same as the original."
There were some enhancements.
"Hey, kids, welcome to the nigga moment reboot!"
This is where we're gonna do some shit we already did and just pretend you didn't see that shit the first time!
"That's right, nigga!"
We don't respect your intelligence!
"Hey, and welcome to ""Cooking with Stink!"""
"We're whipping up a nigga moment today, and here's what you'll need to make one at home!"
"First, you'll need two black men, age 5 to 122."
You can find these pretty much everywhere!
I've got two right here!
Then add one minor incident.
"Could be an errant look, incidental contact."

Delicioso!
"The best thing about nigga moments is, they never stop!"
"Every day for niggas is like ""groundhog day""!"
"Yeah, nigga!"
I hit your car just 'cause I wanted to!
I didn't even want to park in that space!
I just wanted to fuck your car up and then wait here to tell you I did it!
- What you gonna do?
!
- No!
- Two old dudes about to fight!
Do i get flowers even after a rehearsal?
"Well, i've got to send them here until i'm able to hand them to you over the footlights."
"Well, you've always got some excuse."
"Oh, jim, really, you're spoiling me with presents."
Every day it's something new.
No wonder mr.
Boyd criticizes me.
"Oh, now, he doesn't."
"Oh, yes, he does."
"No, he criticizes me because he thinks i don't know anything about women."
"Do you, jim?"
I know all i want to know about one.
But why does he avoid me?
"If i bring him here, will you be nice to him, josie, for my sake?"
"You know, it kind of worries me, the way you two have always got your claws out."
"No, i don't think you'd better... let's forget about mr."
Boyd.
Here he is!
We looked for you at the theater and the rehearsal was over- we knew sooner or later we'd find you here.
"Well, stop moaning and tell me what's up."
Vanderbilt's got the law on us.
What?
He got an injunction so we can't print any more stock.
An injunction?
It's worse than that.
We've sold more stock than we can deliver.
We're cornered.
I told you to watch out for that.
He that sells what isn't his'n must pay it back or go to prison.
"Oh... don't worry, everything is fine, josie."
Certainly- we're in a fine fix.
And this is a fine place to do business.
Are you kidding?
"And waste a chance to know something they don't, something this huge?"
"I'm the best thing that could happen to your mission, 'cause I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know about Earth."
Can you teach me how to make my human stop yelling?
Dani?
I don't think anyone can do that.
"I'm Cody, by the way."
- I'm Blades.
- Boulder.
Classified...
- That's Chase.
- And I'm Heatwave.
"So, Cody, now that you know what we are, name one good reason why we shouldn't leave this planet right now."
These tunnels like this one all over the island.
And they all end in the bunker.
Great for sneaking out of the firehouse.
Wow.
That's like a million optics set in carbon.
- So beautiful.
"- I guess, it kinda is."
So why would you ever wanna leave?
This is what everyone would expect you to act like.
See?
"Lock your legs, stick out your arms..."
You try.
Really?
"I don't know where you learned that, but no."
"Look, Cody, I understand what you're doing, but what I don't understand is how ""talking-like-this"""
has gonna make my rider long respect me.
The trick with Kade is to make him think he is in charge.
"Trust me, I've been doing it for years."
Is that part of the film?
"So we need to get in, get the number without her knowing about it."
How?
We need a woman.
Like Mr Ray Charles says... ..we've got a woman.
You must be joking if you think
"John, how many other birds do you know?"
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
How else would I know which hotel you'd be in?
"Which amoeba, scratching his crutch, not a million miles away, might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world?"
And tell Lenny when you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them again, Calum, you miserable little snitch?"
"I got used to having your big, cheery smile around."
Didn't want to see you leave.
And what do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't really top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning.
I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"Well, as long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So do you think you can get us into the house?
"Yeah, I think I might just be up to it."
Sweet.
"Oh, that's the front door."
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow."
OK?
I'm awfully sorry to disturb you.
A kidnap?
!
"What are you, the cockney Al-Qaeda?"
"Don't shit yourself, we're going for a drive."
"- Hello, mate!"
"- Come on, is this really necessary?"
What about my allergies?
!
Let's talk about this.
Please!
My allergies!
"Wasn't expecting that, was you, mastermind?"
!
See you tomorrow!
Institutionalised bullying wasn't quite the work experience I had in mind.
But I knew how to deal with bullies.
I got my mum to tell the teacher.
"I was hoping you'd be able to do something about it, Mr Gilbert."
- I'm sorry.
- I just wonder what he said to them.
"- I don't think he said anything, Kevin."
- He must have said something.
He walked back through the town centre sopping wet and barely clothed.
I'd hoped you'd take this more seriously.
"He wrote to the paper especially to get work experience, and instead I'm picking frogspawn out of his underpants."
Would you excuse me just for a second?
Ooooooooh God!
"Look,"
"I really want to help, but it's not my responsability."
"I will ask if they'll consider swapping students, but I can't promise anything."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have a meeting to attend to."
What a pickle!
You know he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Doctor Jones.
Die herr in the bar Möchten mit ihnen Sprechen.
Kommen Sie bitte mit uns.
You're looking for me?
"Ha, ha ,ha.."
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other,"
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It wasn't I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.
Yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
Those people from the reformatory
Just fill their time doing that
What's that?
You'll see
What I've dreamed of all my life
A color TV
I'm so happy son!
"Grandma, you should also let Catalina enjoy it"
It should have costed you lots of money
You don't worry about that
"Business are going really fine don't you agree, Angela?"
Yes
Specially the plums exporting business
They're here
Let's go get them
C'mon
"Get down, bastard"
"Hey you, get down, fast!"
Don't move
Let's go
"Come on, let's go"
Let's turn around
- Are you crazy?
"Yes Meca, turn around"
"Come back, let's go fast let's go"
She shot him
Not at such a distance
Yes she did and I don't want deads behind me
Don't say bullshit Nobody has killed anybody
I told you that she would bring complications
But you know what we're doing
"If you're interested OK if you aren't, you know"
"If I were known only by my footwear,"
I'd hang myself.
Beth Ellen Hansen always looks like she's about to cry.
I wish someone would just kick her and get it over with.
"And then of course, there's our teacher..."
Miss Elson.
"She's nice, and polite."
"I bet one day she goes on a psycho killing spree, and all her neighbors will say..."
"""She was nice and polite."""
"Well, from what your last two teachers tell me, it looks like déja vu all over again."
It's time to vote for a sixth grade class president.
"And for the third year in a row... we're down to our final two nominees, and they are Harriet Welsch and Marion Hawthorne."
"And so, as you may know, the duties of the class president include taking attendance, reporting bad behavior and best of all, editing the sixth grade newspaper."
And now we vote.
Marion Hawthorne... again.
Three years in a row.
You know what?
I think I'll invent a poison.
"A really good, clean, untraceable poison."
One that fries your brains and makes all your bodily fluids boil at once.
- Could you?
- Check it out.
"One day I'd be like, ""Oh, hi, Marion."
"""Oh, no, I'm not finishing this soda."""
And she'd be like...
I'm serious.
Any of you guys want to come over?
I got to get home.
"If my amoebas start incubating, they really stink up the house."
Harriet?
Sorry.
Spy time.
"She was very nice, your girl."
"Yes, she is."
She's very nice.
"So like I said, I just want to cross a couple of T's, little stuff."
It's all just part of the process.
"By the way, sir, I was real impressed with your graciousness..."
- on the whole Senator Hanson thing.
- Oh?
"You know, in supporting her."
Real gracious.
"Well, as you know, I withdrew my name from consideration."
Right.
Right.
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.
How long have you known her?
"- Oh, well, actually, I don't really..."
- I'm sorry.
"When you said, ""Anybody that knows her""..."
- I know people who know her.
- Uh-huh.
"- I'm happy to give you their names, if you'd like."
- Great.
"I don't really know her, but I've seen her several times at functions... and, uh, I think she'll do a real good job."
"Sir, can I just say that..."
I was really hoping you'd go for the position... especially after what happened on the Apachaway.
"I think people would think, in the back of their minds..."
"""This here's a guy who takes risks when the right thing's at stake."""
- Lifesaver?
"- No, thanks."
"Anyway, some real bad luck, your being right there."
Not if I'd been able to save her.
It's a psychological truism - people talk about what they can't do.
"Is that why you always talk about acting, plop pants?"
"Perhaps there is a land beyond the oblivion of brain death where your observations would be understood, but to us earthlings, they are mashed potatoes."
So keep them to yourself!
"Richie, it's your choice."
"I can either stuff the meat into the oven, you into the oven or the oven into you."
Which is to be?
The former.
Which one was that?
- That was where the oven...
- Meat...
It doesn't matter.
Tarby'll be here in ten minutes and we haven't cooked a thing.
Get this stuff in the oven.
- I'll never get it all in.
"- Oo-er, sounds a bit rude."
Gonna need something to lever it in with.
"Oo-er, sounds a bit ruder."
"No matter how much I stuff in, there's more to be pushed in."
Oo-er.
It sounds even ruder than it was before.
Thank you for these observations.
Every culinary exchange should be accompanied by the rantings of a braindead vegetable.
"There we are, it's alight."
"Ooh, it's Tarby."
"Oh, God, Tarby's here."
"Oh, God, it's Parky, it's Tarby, it's Lynchy."
The whole gang's here.
"For God's sake, don't do anything rude."
"Hope I'm not late, loobies."
I bought you a bottle of wine but I drunk it in the taxi.
"Oh, God, I'd forgotten I'd invited you, Filthy."
He also buys me birthday gifts.
I'm the one who picks out those birthday gifts.
He has no idea what you even like.
He doesn't care about you at all.
That's not how it is!
Isn't it?
"Dad, he..."
He sends me messages from the States every day!
"Good morning, Mary."
Is the weather in Taipei nice today?
"Mary, I love you."
He writes the same thing every time.
"But the contents of the messages are always the same, right?"
He's just humoring you.
A message like that can just be copied from old ones.
It takes less than a minute to write.
That's not how it is!
"No matter how busy Daddy is, every morning and every night, he writes me an email."
Mary.
"Although every note is pretty much the same, Daddy writes to me every day..."
So what?
Didn't you just say he writes the same thing every day?
A letter like that takes less time than cooking ramen.
"You dare to compare Daddy's letter to ramen, that's too much!"
You say that yourself all the time.
Plus the time here is different from the time in America.
But he still accommodates the times I wake up and go to sleep to write me emails.
He tries really hard!
Isn't that what I frequently say to you?
Maybe those messages aren't even written by your dad.
He could have his assistant write them.
He wouldn't allow other people access to his email!
"Running works, okay?"
"I learned at a very early age, you don't try to be the hero."
"Okay, I ran from bullies, I ran from cops,"
I ran from feelings.
"Okay, I have very good survival instincts."
"If it wasn't for those, I would have been moshed to death at the warped tour."
"Okay, survival instincts, yeah, all right."
What are you supposed to do when there's a tornado coming?
Run.
Where?
Away.
"No, you're supposed to go into the basement."
Wha... go to the basement?
Where the laundry is?
"What am I, gonna do a load of whites?"
"All right, well what about if there's an earthquake?"
Run.
"Again, with the running."
"You know, it's times like this where you really see someone's true colors."
Is that a song?
"No, it's a real emotion, Whitney, all right?"
"You know that we're in a relationship, right?"
"We're supposed to be together, we're supposed to be a team."
"Yes, we're on a team."
"It's called ""team stay alive."""
"Okay, teammate, can you tell me one situation where your first thought wouldn't be to run?"
I guess if I had a bomb strapped to me.
Thatwhen you'd stay with me?
"Come on, man, let it out."
What you feeling?
"Mark, I don't..."
"Dude, for the last time, don't tell me, tell her."
No need to wait here any longer.
He hasn't got the plans.
- We'll see you later on.
- Splendid.!
"Splendid, old boy.!"
I look forward to it.
Might have a spot of lunch at the club one day.
And don't forget to give that message to your superiors.
I know they'll be relieved to hear that.
Good morning.
I tell you the girl must have them on her.
They weren't in her room and she didn't give them to Wooster.
Why not let us go up and get her?
There's no use in being diplomatic.
"From now on, you two keep away from her."
- I'll handle this in my own way.
- If that's the way you want it.
"- Remember, this girl is clever."
- That's why I propose to take care of her myself.
I'm going to meet her in the lobby and then take her to the private garage.
- What about that Wooster?
- You don't need worry about him.
We'll take care of Mr. Wooster after we've got the girl.
"And, remember, we can't afford to fumble this time."
I've wired the chief in Paris that I'll be with him tomorrow.
"Here, you'd better put these in the safe until we get the other half."
"I'll take that, Mr. Manville."
"And now, what have you done with McDermott?"
"- If you'll give me those plans, I'll tell you."
- Don't move.
Don't panic.
She can't hurt you with that.
- That's where Daddy is.
"- Allie, she is so much better."
She's finally on the right combination of meds.
She is seeing a shrink that we adore.
So then why didn't you tell me that she was coming home?
- Because I knew you wouldn't come.
"- Yeah, but you knew I was bringing Luke."
"- I'm telling you, Allie, she's healthy."
- Really?
"When healthy people come home, you don't usually remove the doors."
"- Okay, she's better."
- Until she's not.
"- If you'd gone to see her, you'd know."
- What am I supposed to tell Luke?
- He doesn't...
- You don't have to tell Luke anything.
"We'll just have a nice, stress-free dinner."
"This is a huge transition for her, coming home."
"Please, just don't stress her out."
I just wanted him to see we could be a normal family for five minutes.
"Well, that's about how much time you've got."
Hey.
"Hey, so are all the doors in the door shop?"
Because they're all off their hinges.
That's not the only thing that's off its hinges.
"Oh, I think I hear Daddy."
"Okay, okay, there's no way I'm staying in your room."
"There are no doors, except the bathroom, but that doesn't have a knob."
"You can't lock it, and there's a hole, so anyone can see inside."
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom?
"Trust me, that is the least of our problems."
It's kind of a big problem for me.
You will repent for all these.
"Sir, I am waiting for you."
Who are you?
- I'm Varun.
I'm a program producer in Q TV.
You would have heard about the show.
'Crime:
Why?
What?
When?
'
"No, I haven't."
A very important thing.
"Perumal, one strong tea."
"Sir, tea."
Yes.
- Sir.
A guy was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway recently...
I want some details regarding that case.
Why do you want to know?
I'm working on a program about unsolved death cases caused by road accidents.
Did anyone come in search of this man?
"In some cases, people come searching immediately."
"At other times, they come a bit late."
But no one has come in search of this man so far.
What about his body?
We are done with postmortem and other formalities.
Won't you wait till someone comes to identify the person?
There is neither a mortuary big enough nor the Government funds large enough to do that.
"If no one comes in search of the dead person, we proceed with the formalities."
"If anyone comes after that, we will verify with a photo."
"If we have any of their belongings, we return them."
- In his office.
"Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?"
- We didn't get the plans.
"- Yes, go on."
"We trailed the girl, but she ran into a house occupied by a Bertie Wooster."
We waited all night but didn't see her come out.
"This morning Wooster appeared with his man, got into their car and we followed them."
"- Go on, go on."
- We stopped them on the road... posed as Scotland Yard men and searched them but they didn't have the plans.
They're coming here and that's why we hurried ahead to warn you.
"Yes, Mr. Manville?"
"If Mr. Bertie Wooster arrives, let me know immediately."
"So you followed the two men, forgot all about the girl, eh?"
"No, we left Burton there to watch the house."
He's going to have a long wait because I happen to have the lady in this hotel.
- What?
- I met her when she arrived and arranged to have lunch with her.
She thinks I'm going to help her find Mr. McDermott.
Now listen.
This is what I want you two to do.
And let there be no slipup this time.
Go to her room and make a thorough search of everything.
- We will.
- Just a moment.
And keep an eye on that Wooster fellow.
That's all.
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
"That's not bad, Jeeves."
We did the last mile in exactly one minute and 12 seconds.
"Begging your pardon, sir."
I think that's inaccurate.
"You're going to need money for rent, for living expenses."
"I can help you now, if you want."
Ten quid.
What are you saying?
I was just going through the role of the MOMT in your adjustment to life after prison.
"Nice meeting you, Lindsay."
"We both have such busy schedules,"
I don't think the taxpayer will mind.
Shame I'm going to ruin the evening.
"Right, well, you know you can speak freely."
I can't tell you how to run your department but I want you to move Steve Arnott on.
Make him some other department's problem.
Let me tell you about Steve Arnott.
"He's my most dogged investigator, he will not leave a stone unturned."
I had intended that meeting in a more social setting would make this less confrontational between us.
"Yeah, well... .. we've only just got started."
I would like the chicken liver pate and the sea bass.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
And I'll have the soup followed by the sirloin steak.
Medium well.
And... no sauce.
What's the matter?
I'm a married man.
Separated.
I took vows.
I can't undo them.
"Don't you want to stay with me, Ted?"
"I'm sorry, Gill."
I'm sorry.
I don't need to watch this if you want to put something else on.
It's fine.
"If Atlantis was real, it would mean rewriting the history books."
"I thought that was an archaeologist's job, to rewrite history."
I guess some people are frightened of change.
Yes?
MacGyver and Miss Carson have arrived.
They're about to open the Ark.
Good.
You know what to do.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
The words on the medallion and the Ark are identical.
Coincidence.
You can't expect us to believe these two artifacts are in any way connected.
"""The gods march in rank,"
"""and Hecate races in the heavens."
"""Enter the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages--"""
"""And the Treasure of Atlantis shall rise."""
"I've seen this riddle in the caves at Exeter, carved on an altar by the Cult of Solon."
So the gods are these figures on the side here?
Yes.
"Hermes, Aphrodite, Gaea, Selene,"
"Ares, Zeus and Cronus."
"This little guy on top, um, how do you pronounce it?"
Hecate.
Demon of the night.
"According to ancient legend, she was an omen of disaster and death."
I'm convinced that these are really instructions written by Solon to help find the Treasure of Atlantis.
Addle-minded bunk.
"The legend of Atlantis is just that, a legend."
I can prove it existed.
Why should we?
We didn't have anything anyone would want!
"Easy, easy."
They poured it on like...
"Like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using."
I tried to signal them.
"We called up, tried to surrender."
We had women and children.
I told them that.
I begged them.
They wouldn't listen.
They didn't let up for a moment.
"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus III."
One for the Enterprise to go there and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.
"They hit us a full day before you got there, captain."
"No messages came from us, captain."
Why did they do it?
Why?
Why did they do it?
There has to be a reason.
- There has to be a reason!
- It was a trap.
Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus III.
Getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.
Very clever.
As to the reason...
The reason is crystal clear.
The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.
"Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
"You allude to invasion, captain, yet positive proof has not..."
I have all the proof I need on Cestus III.
"Not necessarily, sir."
"Your mother, how can you leave her alone?"
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena."
I cried all the way to New York and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves that had started to fall back home.
"For days, I struggled to keep alive and I shivered with loneliness in a back room on the fourth floor of nowhere."
"There were times when I wanted to crawl home but somehow I managed, and I stayed."
"I learned what I could endure, but none of us, in New York or in Peyton Place could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter of deep despair."
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings driving their sons to a place of hurried goodbye.
I prayed for them.
"Fellas, get your last cup of civilian coffee."
The Army stuff is used for waterproofing shingles.
That's what I heard.
- You hear what Norman Page did?
- Became the first 4F in town.
"No, he enlisted in the paratroopers."
- Our Norman?
- Norman Page?
"- He volunteered, the paratroopers."
- That's funny.
- Maybe they'll drop his mother.
- She'd kill 1000 Japanese before she'd let one touch her little boy.
Brought you a doughnut.
"Rodney, I'm gonna cry."
"No, you don't."
"Betty, you don't know how glad I am that I married you."
"Rodney, I hope so."
Your father's over there.
Go say goodbye to him.
Go on.
Go say goodbye to him.
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
The harm's already done.
You behave... like a hooligan.
That's what I had in mind.
You might have warned me.
"Since you were there, it's all right."
You really have changed.
I thought you were a good citizen... like in the days we were studying.
You change according to your place.
"Because of your job... private companies,"
you work hard...
"Balla, you should never treat a friend so badly."
I've never been so serious.
"Private companies, then... you work hard... and make nothing."
Who told you that?
You've never worked... for the public sector.
You work very little and make ten times more... than in the private sector.
"If you don't believe me, then that's that..."
Listen!
You know very well... that while not in the public sector... my salary is more than enough... and I don't need more to get by.
You disappoint me.
"Hi, Tiekoura!"
"Hi, boss!"
How are you?
Any news?
The young ones came to tell me about a meeting.
Organized by the new engineer?
We have no confidence in him.
"With or without your confidence, let's listen to him."
We'll judge him by his actions.
He doesn't have to be like the ones before.
For sure.
Let's go and listen to him.
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.
"If all goes wrong, I'll come back and sleep in that stall."
What about your tack?
Just leave it in there.
"Anybody that's brave enough... to go in there and get it, they're welcome to it."
"- Harry, pass the champagne."
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.
"Now, how can I pass the champagne when Dexter here drank it all?"
"Barkeep, a little more champagne."
Soon as we get to San Francisco...
I want to check out where Mahare is training.
Gonna be pretty tough.
"I understand he's copying your style, Jim."
I'm not worried about him.
"The last 10 guys he faced, he knocked them out."
"He's never seen Jim's footwork, either."
Remember that Florida fight?
"You were so fast, he couldn't land a punch."
That new punch of yours is the greatest in the game.
"Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?"
"No, I haven't."
We're toasting the man with the greatest hook punch in the world.
"Barkeep, give Tex some champagne so that he can toast with us."
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.
"Jim, you brought a touch of class to this game."
And a lot of pretty ladies.
"Tex, you ready?"
What are we toasting?
We're toasting the next heavyweight champion of the world:
"""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett."
"He's gotta fight for it yet, so he ain't champion."
This team's not the Colts.
"The Colts are in the NFL, these... whoevers, they're in the Canadian Football League."
I find the CFL's game very entertaining.
It's a souped-up version of the American classic.
"The field is what, 120 yards long, with 35 yard in-zones, that's not a football field, Munch, that's the golf course at Oakmont Green."
"Their game's for speed and mobility, not three yards in a cloud of dust."
"I say, if you're gonna imitate an American sport, do it like Americans."
They don't wanna play our game.
That's why they invented their own.
"Then let them play it, but we're in America."
"I mean, we shouldn't be playing their version here."
That's a sacrilege.
That flies in the face of Balto football history.
Some tradition!
The owner packs up the team and sneaks off in the night.
"What's up, fellas?"
Stan's on a tear about the Canadian Football League.
It ain't the Canadians.
What's wrong with American sports is you type of Americans.
What type is that?
"The type who don't remember the heroes, who don't believe in miracles anymore."
"Yeah, the type who bet against Buffalo winning the Superbowl."
- You done with the sports page?
- Yeah.
Even God wouldn't bet on the Billys.
Frank?
Where'd you wander off to?
I just had a little one on one with a potential witness.
A witness in the Marilyn Callisto murder?
Mm-hm.
What'd they say?
As usual... he was silent.
Sex with a human. it's beneath us.
- I feel dirty by association.
- No of fence taken.
"You know, if it had been one slip ..."
But it's turned into a full-blown affair.
He has feelings for her.
Found these in his desk.
They're from her.
They've been writing to each other for months.
- On paper?
- It has to stop.
"I'd kill the girl myself, but we Light Fae really are supposed to frown on harming humans."
"How generous of you, Olivia."
But you're unaffiliated.
It would be so nice and uncomplicated for you to get rid of her.
What are your rates for exterminating?
"It wasn't a coincidence that I ended up in bed with you, was it?"
I chose you because of the job.
My taste of you has convinced me you're strong enough.
"Well, problem, Liv, is that I'm not an assassin."
"One touch, and she's six feet under."
And you're for hire.
What's the issue?
"Oh, you know, how killing someone is wrong."
You're not hearing me.
I'm not gonna snuff out a life because it clashes with your drapes.
Fine.
"Screw the complications, I will take care of this myself."
We should probably find this Jenny.
And save her from a jealous Fury.
Yeah.
- So where do we find her?
"You mean, what did I do with it, you obsessed woman."
Black Widow.
"First of all, Robin and I will wanna return all the stolen moneys to banks A through H."
What a perfect idea.
- And secondly-- Batman.
"Oh, it's really you."
"In cape and cowl, commissioner."
Why?
"- I'll explain later, but thank heaven."
- And this is Black Widow.
So you're the she-devil who's been robbing us out of house and home.
"Oh, you must be Chief O'Hara."
What a delightful surprise.
"Why don't you ask her if she'd like to go along to jail with you, Chief O'Hara?"
"Oh, don't ask."
"My heart says no but my brain says yes, love."
I feel it's my responsibility to tell you that you have the constitutional right to consult with your attorney before answering any questions.
-Ah!
But I want to answer his questions.
"Sweetheart, I cannot tell you how much you remind me of my dear departed Max."
"- You'd better come with me, Black Widow."
-Thank you.
"Goldberg, you take care of the rest of them."
"I can't wait to see how it turns out, angel."
"If it really looks good, I'd love to have you come over every day and give me a wash and set."
Why don't we have a look?
Ah!
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
And only Batman knows for sure.
Batman there's a question I got to be asking you and the Boy Wonder.
"Yes, chief?"
[Tires screech]
[Train whistle blares]
What else did she tell you about this cat?
Anything?
"Just that Adalind brought it in, and it scratched her."
And she wouldn't believe anything I said about Adalind.
That's why I brought her to the trailer.
That's why I brought her to you.
"Okay, I get it."
"But I got to tell you, it was a little on the short side for a warning."
- When did she get scratched?
- Today.
"Look, Nick, I know you're hoping the doctors are going to be able to do something for her, but you saw what happened to Hank, you saw what happened to your sergeant."
"We got to get our hands on that cat, man."
- Detective Burkhardt?
- Yeah?
We have her stabilized.
"If this is an infectious disease, she'll need to stay quarantined."
"Normally, cat scratches are not that dangerous, so there may be something else going on here."
The tests are going to take quite a while to run.
There's nothing more you can do right now.
I suggest you go home.
"As soon as we know something, we'll call you."
"Look, Nick,"
I know you want to stay here and be with Juliette.
I do.
But that's not going to help.
Let's find that cat.
All right.
[Cell phone rings]
- Yeah.
- Nick.
THe difference by that time was that He was really determined to be an actor.
"Now, you edge over a little bit, ""Mr. Maverack."""
I don't want to get a bill for tbat mirror.
He did some Maverick episodes.
I don't know How many He did.
He did one or two.
You could just tell clint was going to be somebody.
He bad great stage presence.
We were both very young at the time.
He was offered Rawbide and I remember we were living across the street from each other.
"I was backing out of my driveway, be was backing out of bis and be said be needed to talk to me because be was offered tbls series."
"He said: ""Wbat sbouId I ask for?"""
"I said: ""I don't know, but I tell you wbat not to do."
"""Just don't get locked up so tight you can't get out. """
Tbere's plenty of places to bold tbem off once we're across.
I don't tbink tbe wagon will make it across tbe stream.
We'II bave to try.
"But it was pretty obvious that Clint, even though Rowdy was not the lead role He was the outstanding actor."
First time I bad a scene witb clint I was playing a Native American.
It's good.
"I pick up wbite man's ways, mission scbool."
Mission scbool?
"And I say: ""Quadero bas eaten of tbe dark musbroom."""
Quadero bas eaten of tbe dark musbroom.
His words are witbout sense.
"Clint started breaking up, and I did too."
THe director said¸:
"""WHat's the matter?"
"""WHat's so funny?"""
I said:
"""This kind of reminds me of macbeth."""
And tbe guy says:
"That big, stupid--"
It was my shop!
My office!
Who do you think everyone was looking to for running things?
Me.
Lisa Pedersen.
But I paid Mr.-
- Mr. Somers nothing.
Who else did you tell about those bids?
Who else could have had private dealings with Somers?
I don't understand.
I don't remember.
"Lisa, do you recall correspondence with a certain shoe company in Chicago?"
A company interested in obtaining a large building site?
A company who had written concerning the property occupied by Axel's cabinet shop?
"Oh, that."
I-
- I threw that in the wastebasket.
"Yet that company still expected to obtain the property, just as they'd already obtained the land next to it, the land once slated for Axel's Hospital?"
"Now think hard, Lisa."
Who else did you tell about the bids?
"It must have been a man who dealt with Somers, since he obviously knew what Somers had planned."
"It must have been a man who, on the night of the murder, told Axel where to find Somers."
"Now, it must have been--"
[Lisa] Yes.
"Yes, I told him."
Somers was a crook.
And out-and-out crook.
"Oh, yes, I knew it."
And what he was up to-- everything.
I paid him to tell me.
In return I was to have an option on the property he never intended to use anyway.
"But,uh, won't the police say--"
"Hey,the rat's the one destroying evidence,not me."
We're not sure that it is evidence.
It may not be the knife she used.
"If it is the knife, we are going with self-Defense."
So we are not going to deny that she killed him with it.
"Of course,the cops could still charge us with evidence tampering."
"Well,that's no problem."
We'll just defend ourselves.
"We're tntg,right?"
"""We don't lose."""
"They really didn't go over this part in law school,mr."
Graves.
It's okay.
The defense lawyers
Have as much right to gather evidence as prosecutors.
Most defense lawyers are just too lazy or scared to do it.
"Plus,if we waited for the cops to find evidence,"
We'd never win our cases.
Come on.
Let's just hope it was self-Defense.
"'Cause if it wasn't, we just found the evidence"
That's gonna convict our client.
Good work.
Come on.
100% innocent.
-=The last fantasy=- Proudly presents
"Like i always say,"
"If you got the right lawyer with you,"
We've got the greatest legal system in the world.
Got it.
Thanks.
- But -
"Yeah, but we've had this conversation."
Yes?
Mmm.
Why aren't you having any?
There's only enough bacon for one.
You have it.
"Hands and knees, Pat."
I'm waiting.
I'm begging you to help me.
"After you gave David the all-clear, he went down the recruitment office to find out about signing up."
"When the time comes, they'll give him a medical and if they find anything relating to asthma, they won't take him."
Tell them he's got it.
David is a young man -
- He's not a young man!
He's a boy!
A 16-year-old child.
I understand how you must be feeling.
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.
All I'm asking is you write to the recruitment office and tell them that David has a history of chronic asthma.
"But, Miriam, he doesn't."
"It's acute at best and has, thankfully, been on the wane for a number of years."
They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!
"With all due respect, Erica, this is between me and Dr Campbell."
Will has looked after your family for many years.
"He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice."
He can't possibly do that.
I sympathise.
I really do.
But you'll do nothing.
And this isn't the first time.
"If she doesn't get regular treatment, she will attempt suicide again."
"And Hong Jin-chul has many problems, such as his lungs and kidney."
It's a miracle that he's even still alive.
He calls himself a doctor?
- Damn it.
- What?
Recruit circus performers?
How about setting up a funeral home?
We're all being punished by God because you all have no faith.
"I always asked you to go to church, but you all never listened to me."
No need for it all!
It's over!
What can we do with dying people?
They need to be alive at least if we're going to eat them or not.
The game's over if they die beforehand.
Since when have you gotten so smart?
"You got it all down, don't you?"
I'm not as dumb as you think.
I thought you were a complete bonehead.
I'm glad that you realize I'm not.
"Anyway, I could die earlier than I expected because of you all."
Living a 1000 years is enough.
"What, you bastard?"
How dare you talk back to me.
Stop it please!
There's still 15 days left.
It's not late to find more.
How can we look again in these circumstances?
We're even murder suspects.
"Yeah, I told you not to come down."
You said something right for once.
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey Tris, I really like your hair by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that.
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down huh?"
Or what?
Besides I think we all should stick together now that we are officially fugitives.
Wait what do you mean by officially fugitives?
Oh you don't know?
You didn't tell Caleb?
"Yes, now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of regenade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
And Jeanine needed a reason to petition the council to institute martial law.
And now she has one.
Staying here at Amity is our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground and find out where the rest of Dauntless are.
- Then we can make a move.
- We need to kill Jeanine.
"I know, we're not ready yet."
"- Beatrice you're not being serious, right?"
- No I am being serious..
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
Tris you can't just go around killing people.
"No she's right, listen to your sister."
"Tris, I think you should go to"
Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself.
I'll stay with Caleb so you don't get him killed too.
What?
"Come on, you know... like you did your parents."
Stop!
Babs.
Call me Babs.
Or Coach.
Or whatever makes you feel comfortable.
Never.
I will never call you Coach because I promise you I am never going to enter that contest.
"Well, what about T.C. and saving the Island Hoppers?"
What about Roger and me?
"I mean, this whole deal depends on your entering this contest."
- I mean...
- Good morning.
"I am sorry about all that, believe me, and I'd do anything for T.C..."
"anything else, I mean."
Oh.
And maybe we can work something out about finding Roger.
"Oh, no, I could never accept charity."
"Well, then pay me later, but just don't talk to me about this contest."
"Ah, the contest."
"The excitement, the anticipation, the agony."
"Now, here are the items you requested, courtesy of the household account."
"Protein powder, vitamins with an emphasis on """" B"" complex, tuna for tuna shakes."
"It sounds positively revolting, but I'm sure it's quite nourishing."
"Higgins, what is this?"
Paying out of the household account?
You never pay for anything for me out of...
Wait.
How'd you find out about this?
T.C. told me his plans when I let him in last night.
"For once I agreed with him, and so does Mr. Masters."
It's a capital idea.
Robin?
You talked to Robin?
Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
"You okay in there, bestie?"
I'm fine...
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness;
the inability to pass uri...
"Yeah, I said I'm fine."
Stop talking to me.
She always this crabby when she urinates?
We're really not that close.
Screw it.
I'll go later.
And I'll be right by your side.
Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
"Oh, that's nice."
"No, it's not."
It's a strategic maneuver.
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group.
That bitch is crafty.
- You think?
- Of course.
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?
By going after its weakest member.
"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
"Okay, Amy, you're being silly."
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.
And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.
"Ooh, these are cute."
"Of course if I buy them,"
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
It doesn't matter.
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"- No argument, Lenny."
- And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3,000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor if you don't transport their employees BankExchange will dump this deal and forget about New York and put up their 60-story building in New Jersey instead."
So be it.
"The mayor loves BankExchange, but can't afford infrastructure."
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp it can't pay for them.
- Where are you going?
- I have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
"It's sad, really, to see a once-mediocre realtor reduced to this."
"Gil, please, let's keep this civil."
"Oh, by the way, if you ever speak disrespectfully again about my wife, I'll kill you."
Sorry.
That sounded like a joke.
I will actually kill you.
"Anyhoo, when you guys wake up and smell the sulfur, here's a list of other realtors, and if you need me, I'll be in the office at 9:00..."
"Uh, 10:00."
I have the dentist.
Where did that come from?
Life's too short to be ruled by fear.
"What do you say we get you the right dryer, princess?"
"Oh, my."
"I mean, Phil is usually just so..."
"But then he was just, like, so..."
And then he got even more...
There's nothing I can do.
- I can't go for that.
- No can do.
Cameron here bought an eggshell dryer.
"Not white, not oatmeal, not Swiss-coffee, not baby-powder, not bone."
Eggshell.
"Look, Rob, is it?"
That's interesting.
Here's how this is going down...
We don't leave without that eggshell dryer.
"Not swan-feather, not Chester-pig-white."
I think we've covered the colors.
I sell houses to people every day who ask me where they should buy their dryer.
I don't think you want me giving them any... static.
I may have one in the back.
"But it takes two guys to load the truck, and it's just me today."
We can't wait any longer.
It's time we take back what is ours!
It's time to take back our city!
"Say ""Nuktuk."""
"There they are, folks, the sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple,"
Bolin and ginger.
Let me get a picture.
"Wow, that was fun."
And did you hear what Shiro said?
We're Republic City's most famous couple.
"Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend."
We are not a couple.
That's not what Shiro said.
Stop stuffing your moustaches with varri-cakes and get to your post!
"You got it, boss."
You two are the pinnacle of refinement.
"This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier, folks."
"President Raiko and the first lady, buttercup Raiko, just arrived."
"And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire,"
Varrick.
"There they are, my two most honored guests."
Mwah!
What do you think?
No expense has been spared.
I brought in the finest entertainers from ba sing se and the best food from around the world.
"Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the fire nation."
They make the best red stuff over there.
In fact...
"all right, picture time!"
"Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
I wanted to.
"Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste."
"- hello, alberto CoIombo."
- Borghetti.
You wanted to see me?
I'd Iike to check a few details on yourtransfer application.
would you Iike help?
"It's kids, always slashing the tires."
please sit down.
What can I do foryou?
How long have you been disabled?
It's not easy to talk about.
I was very young.
The memory is blurred.
It's terrible to relive that trauma.
muscle spasms.
Done.
"please, go on."
There are two transfer applications in yourname.
A recent one for a person with reduced mobility and another six months ago in which the applicant is normal.
Are you the same person?
They're both mine.
I did the one as a healthy person... because I wanted my application to be considered like all the others.
"It's important to see in a ""normal"" person's eyes something otherthan pity."
- That's quite honorable.
- Thank you.
But if this compromises my transfer...
"It's a simple but necessary check, because often people make false statements to get a position in milan."
It happens very often.
It's shameful.
"But that's not your case, you'II be fine in milan."
Thank you.
I won't botheryou any further.
No bother at all.
And I did go looking for someone to help me get away.
And I am glad that I did.
"Because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have found you."
But you already had a husband.
Not in my eyes.
My father arranged that marriage when I was 14.
Did you object to the arrangement at that time?
It didn't seem real at that time.
"Besides, in my family we didn't often object to my father's wishes."
Did you make any preparations to be married?
No!
I was in school.
I was learning about the world.
And then I realised that I wasn't going to be allowed to be a part of it.
"That my world, my life, had all been decided for me."
And so I decided to leave.
And I would do it again.
You would do it again with a dowry given to you by another man?
I was frightened.
What if things didn't work out with Jimmy?
My family would have disowned me.
I would have nothing.
Nothing?
"Actually, you would have $575,000 in a Swiss bank."
You doing okay?
"I don't know, sir."
She never told me about any of that.
"You know, you have your own trial to concentrate on."
"Don't lose sight of that, huh."
"God, I wouldn't even be on trial, sir, if she'd never told me she loved me."
"Will you excuse me, sir?"
I just...
"Oh, shit, I forgot about the car."
You haven't been moving it for street cleaning?
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?
(TUTS)
I kind of would have thought this to be beneath you.
"You know, at one time I would have as well, but look at me now."
- You're a man of contradictions.
"- No, I'm not."
Who are all these assholes?
They're my friends.
"""They're my friends."""
Mostly.
"I got this job, this..."
"This national ad campaign, so..."
We're celebrating.
That's great.
NARRATOR: 'Philip wished Ashley had not reminded him 'of how great it felt to be proud of her.
'His own relationship with success had forced him 'to grow out of feeling resentful towards her accomplishments.
'He was not prepared to lose that constant stream of enthusiasm.'
You see?
You don't even need me.
"God, you really believe that, don't you?"
I'm not sure how to answer that without making things worse.
I supported you when nobody gave a shit about you.
I want you to know I regret that now.
Good.
ASHLEY:
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
So you can just...
you can be somebody else's charity case.
- Maybe Zimmerman will take care of you.
I specifically remembered making sure that he had a cot.
"I think he made that up, I think he wanted the attention."
"He totally did, he's such a drama queen."
"- He was a trouper, though."
- I don't know how he did that...
"I think it really hurt him to sit and stuff so when he's sitting in the van, you know..."
But he never really complained.
"But look at the energy, just..."
"I mean, when I'm in agony, I don't do stuff like that, normally."

"Remember, when we were waiting to go outside?"
That was all we needed.

# Killing me softly with his song #
# Killing me softly #
Who the hell is that?
# Telling my whole life with his words #
# Killing me softly with his song #
# I felt all flushed with fever # # embarrassed by the crowd #
# I felt he found my letters # # and read each one out loud #
# I prayed that he would finish # # but he just kept right on #

# Singing my life with his words #
# Killing me softly #
Give it a rest.

What if he comes to know that the girl is a lawyer?
You must be lucky that a beautiful girl resides with you.
Then why should you bother about her job?
-What are your blabbering man?
"-Oh no, he scolds me."
- You can not face competition at your house?
Just because she looks good we can't take such decisions.
- If only she is an advocate...
"- No, she is a software engineer."
He is going to puke over me after eating all this.
Look how he tears off the chicken leg!
- Have you got my phone number?
- It is good that you reminded me.
I can't harm myself more than this.
I should change my number immediately.
First..
"- Hey listen, first comes only once."
- May be he is utilizing me to taste all these different drinks.
- Hi dude - dude?
Why should we maintain decorum after we are drunk?
You are always a dude.
Can I ask you a question?
Please ask.
If you paying for your drinks how much would you drink?
- I never buy my drinks.
- Why?
If you buy your own drinks then you'll wipe out all your savings on booze.
"- But if some one like you buy me drinks, I shall oblige."
"- Me, you mean?"
Buying willingly?
- Boy
- Hey don't come.
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried,right?"
"- Silver stars,Korean war?"
"- Yeah,yeah."
"Look,forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah,and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.

But I've heard about the mind games in here.
**********
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills,Mr.Petty.Those are mints."
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle,the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
Follow me.
Take a seat.
- I'm DS...
- Tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
"As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott."
DC Fleming.
"Mr Fairbank, we'd like to begin by asking you about a social worker who went missing in October '98, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd."
Doesn't ring a bell.
"If we may, sir, perhaps this report might jog your memory."
Blind as a bat without these.
Are you sure you don't want a tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
Sorry.
The report was copied to you.
"I mean, is there any reason you might take an interest?"
None at all.
Can you explain why you'd be sent this report?
"Well, I don't remember any of this."
"I mean, you're going back a good many years."
"We'd like to show you some newspaper clippings, if we may."
You appear to be quite close to Councillor Dale Roach.
Our paths crossed occasionally.
Usually at a charity event.
We weren't close.
"Well, we're looking into allegations of child sexual exploitation involving Councillor Roach."
"As head of Vice, did you ever deal with any complaints against Roach?"
"Well, there may have been some such saying,"
"""Councillor Roach has done this,"" or, ""Councillor Roach did that."""
And what would it be that the councillor did?
The alternative seems more painful than being shot.
In principle I try to live as a witness-protection program.
You have to change all your habits.
You can not have any habits.
On an ordinary day you stand up and eat breakfast.
Playing perhaps his son.
So you need to know the playground you have to go on.
It's a little hard to explain to a child -
- Why one should go by train one day and by bus the next -
- Or by subway or car.
"Man has always checked the car, before starting it."
A child found it's fun at first -
"- But when you do it every day, they begin to consider why."
"Had I known it would end like this here, I would have never made it."
"To be honest, I was I probably quite naive and young and stupid -"
- For the price I pay is   incredibly high.

"But of Peter's story, so ..."
What ...
like ...
We talked about it earlier.
"There is approximately 75-80%, which is true, has happened, and 30% ..."
"I said to Joel, that I had full confidence in him."
That what he does is good.
- It's only me who has to be you.
"- Yes, actually."
Previously on Alcatraz...
Meet the '63s.The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.He was an inmate.
"That's him.Tommy Madsen,he killed my partner."
"From then on,any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with special ops.
Lance corporal finn's record does not indicate he was involved with special operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see lance corporal finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for iraq.
- How'd you meet?
- At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked is that when we talked, he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy,he had seen real action."
"And I was feeling patriotic that night, so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get enged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay,they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look,didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a gal document?
Holy shit.
You got more and more beautiful since I last saw you.
How do you do that?
What is your secret?
It's youth.
And she's clever too.
I haven't seen you forever.
"Mom, can I stay for a bit?"
"Yeah, if it's okay with Nicole."
"I'm gonna put you to work if you're gonna stay, so get changed, and there's an extra pair of gloves by the door."
Okay.
"Don't dig too deep, okay?"
Why?
Is this where you're hiding all the bodies?
Kind of.
Remember when Mom had that problem with the morning glories?
"Yeah, she was obsessed."
"I mean, they're beautiful, but she said there was too much of them, too much beauty."
Yeah.
"If you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the other plants."
So you have two options.
"You can either pull them all out, start fresh, or you can ride the chaos."
"So which is it for you, Mary?"
"If anything ever happened to me, you'd take care of them, right?"
"Normally I'm not usually happy to see to see a dead man but I'm happy, I really am."
Finally got a body.
Yeah.
"Well, if pento shows up in the autopsy, then it's over, right?"
She basically handed us the case.
"We rattled her with the wire, she slipped up."

No!
Hit high pitch!
How long will you sing the same line?
Come to the point.
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
That's it!
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
Past has vanished...
life is at full blast...
Hit the lucky chance...
What's this in between lines from film 'Chandramukhi?
"I don't remember anyone, I've lost my memory..."
Not like Rajini but like Ghajini...
Brain is empty...
totally it's gone...
"I'm having a good time, don't keep your face dull..."
Ex-girl friends who have left me...
And those silly clashes...
I'm saying thanks to the mental peace I'm enjoying now...
"Good or bad, sweet or bitter, she's not seen  flash is not leaving me..."
Life without love is better...
Who will bear that nonsense all the life...
Poor Devadas fell for Paru...
Your lover is somebody else's wife...
This life is better...
It's better than intoxication...
Silence is much better...
Spend life with empty heart...
Always fresh is the base of life...
"No, thanks."
"I had a raisin earlier and, boy, am I stuffed."
"Sabrina, you're looking awfully skinny."
"You're not still on that diet, are you?"
Me?
"No, I'm fine."
"Hey, do I see a little scalp up there?"
(gasps)
(gasps)
Don't tell me.
I've inherited the Spellman gene for a keister the size of Manhattan.
"Oh, I knew it."
It was just some sort of spell.
And yet the insecurity about my butt won't go away.
I think it's time to bring back suspenders.
"Sabrina, we have to talk."
"Oh, well, I only have a little while before Harvey picks me up for the dance and your stern lectures tend to eat up the clock."
"Not only are these things a scam, but they can cause serious side effects."
But I have to lose weight.
Like making you think you have to lose weight.
"Come here, look in the mirror."
"No, not the mirror!"
It's so cruel and unforgiving!
Not anymore.
"That creepy salesman put a spell on it, but I deactivated it."
See?
What are you talking about?
It's like looking at a picture of William Howard Taft.
"Oh, no."
All this dieting has affected you psychologically.
"You can't see that you're so thin, you're practically sick."
"Oh, well, what good is my health if I'm not Queen?"
Do you want to come?
EVERYTHING IS READY
I am very contented to see everyone reunited here.
For me it is something indespensible.
I am happy that you have prevailed in life and that you have become fortunate.
Today we will celebrate.
A party like in our youth.
I hope you have a prosperous future.
Today's special:
CURRY RICE. 15 CENTS
It's a pity on a day like this if you must pay.
For us the times ahead are very difficult.

How is your English?
Therefore you will no longer be anxious.
The school is in the city of Tochigi.
Shall we go?
"Don't be sad, someday we shall return to Tokyo."
You have not rid yourself of the vice of arriving late?
Let us sing the hymn of the school.

Your face is still as vibrant as a scarlet flower.

"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Your streetcar's over there.
Go on now.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
It's just busy.
"Los Angeles in January, San Francisco..."
"Powell's in Portland, the whole West Coast thing, really."
I'm told to expect big things out there.
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.
And you're doing a really hurtful job of sounding unfazed.
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.
"You're not interested in this or me, not even a little."
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.
- And you don't now.
"- Well, good for you."
"No, not good for me."
Great for me.
"You know, you told me many times, now that I think about it, actually, that my goals were unreasonable and foolhardy."
Am I recalling this correctly?
"That my dream, the only dream I've had since I was 14 years old, to write and publish a novel of my own, wasn't something I could just reach out and have."
"Hard work, you tell me."
"Years of working up from the bottom, you tell me."
"Well, you know something?"
You were wrong.
"Dead wrong, actually."
About me and everything.
This was for you.
It's an advance copy.
I'd even written a little note on the dedication page and everything.
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.
So you don't get this gift from me.
"Not today, not ever."
"Just because a man has one perfect rose in his garden at home, it doesn't mean that he can't appreciate the flowers of the field."
-Does that make sense?
"-Oh, sure."
"But while you were out sniffing around these other little wildflowers, didn't the rose kind of fade?"
Practically out of the picture.
That's why I reformed.
"Hello, Brandon."
I'm very glad to see you.
"Rosa, this is Isabel Lorrison, an old friend of mine."
-Rosa Senta.
-How are you?
I think I'd better be getting back to my friends.
"-Yes, why don't you?"
-Isabel...
And thank you for keeping Mr. Bourne amused.
You're good for a few laughs yourself.
So long.
You've answered all my questions.
"A year of travel hasn't improved your manners, Isabel."
Was it my manners that interested you?
What interests me now is what you want.
Nothing that should frighten you.
"If you have something to say, say it at once."
-I haven't much time.
"-Oh, not here."
Why not?
Is your Mr. Dawning jealous?
Naturally.
"I may be a year older, Bran, but I haven't lost my touch."
"Let's go for a little walk, for old time's sake, or even just to prove that you're not afraid of the dark."
"You see, Bran, it's not so very dark."
"On the contrary, it's the blaze of noon, Isabel, revealing everything."
Objection!
"Your Honour, my client's future rests on the testimony of this man and this man only."
I'll allow it.
"But no fishing expeditions, Mr Greene."
Your Honour.
"Mr Shrimpton, you said you know my client."
I've seen him around.
Did he ever give you money?
Yeah.
"Yeah, once he did."
"He helped a lot of homeless people, didn't he?"
"He used to come around, paint us, give out cash."
"In fact, he gave away thousands of dollars, didn't he?"
Fair bit.
"It was you who led my client to the lane that night, wasn't it?"
He said he wanted to paint him.
"Because you told Denny, and I quote,"
'Benny's an effing little Adonis.'
"Yeah, I don't remember me exact words."
Had you had oral sex yourself with Ben Rigby that evening?
"Come on, Mr Shrimpton."
Maybe a brief but therapeutic tryst up a back lane?
"Yeah, but, you know, just a quick one."
Take comfort.
Premature ejaculation's not on trial here.
"Listen, pal, I seen that sick bastard there whack that poor little kiddie."
And yet you did nothing to stop him.
"Went and got help, didn't I?"
Maybe you went and got an alibi.
"See, I'm at a bit of a loss, Mr Shrimpton."
"You say my client kills the boy he's gone to give money to and then instead of bolting, he drags his body 30m down a lane, and then hangs around for 15 minutes."
Why would he do that?
Yes.
Carlotta told me that you're feeling anxious.
"More like, uh, terrified."
I have seen so many patients die.
You'd think that I'd know how to do this.
I-I...
Okay.
We're...
"We're here to help, and we... we want to, so we've set up hospice care in your home."
But what else can we do?
"Uh, antidepressants or..."
"No, no, no."
Antidepressants take up to two weeks to work.
"By then, I'll be dead."
Ohh.
There must be something.
I'll try anything.
Okay.
I have a... a colleague at a palliative care center.
"And he's in clinical trials, treating terminally ill patients with psilocybin."
What?
Hallucinogenic mushrooms?
"- No, I know, Owen."
- Are you serious?
"I know what you're thinking, Owen, but it..."
Psilocybin has been tested all over the world to treat anxiety and depression in terminally ill patients.
"Apparently, people are having life-altering experiences."
What... what...
What kind of experiences?
"As far as I can tell, they're starting to see themselves as part of a larger whole."
"It's very spiritual, and..."
"And afterwards, death seems less frightening."
- Bastard!
I command you by the judge of the living and the dead to depart from this servant of God.
It's the power-
- Holy water.
It's the power of Christ that compels you.

What I don't get was how angry Pam was.
I didn't hurt anyone but myself.
- It's not like I robbed a bank.
"-Yeah, or bombed a church."
Do you have this in an eight and a half?

I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
Or bombed a church.
"In some cultures, when you burn yourself it's a ceremony."
It's called self-immolation.
My uncle used to do it all the time.
It was a great trick.
He'd put the stuff on it and light it... and it would just go out when he went like this.
"Right before I lit it, I suddenly remembered... it's alcohol that burns but doesn't burn up."
Lighter fluid just burns.
"And then I thought, ""It's okay."
"It's better this way."""
"I just think of it as part of good service, you know?"
No.
"No, we don't touch the foot anymore."
"If you notice, we spend a lot of time touching the shoe-"
Lacing the shoe- then we just put it on the ground and watch you try to get your foot in.
"We can hand you tools- a shoehorn, a nylon sock- but we will never touch your foot with our hands."
"Now, I'll tell you what I can do."
I can press on the shoe to see if it fits.
Especially you after you get your cut.
"What, I'm not entitled?"
I assume all the risk.
It's business.
You know how many bodies I see come through my hospital mortuary each week?
/ No.
Accident victims.
"Kids with healthy, beautiful transplantable organs at their loved ones won't sign a consent to donate."
That's their choice.
You wouldn't be saying that if it was your mother.
"Or your wife, or your child that were dying."
"You know, you'd be begging for my phone number."
"Well, your number's up."
Feds will be putting you away for ten years easy.
"But give us the transplant surgeon, and we'll see to it that you're home by Christmas."
"Oh, man."
"You guys didn't hear a word I said, did you?"
This guy thinks he's the second coming.
"Well, he's got a point."
- Are you an organ donor?
- Yup.
I thought Jews had to be buried with all their body parts.
I figure the Big guy will give me a pass if I leave a piece of myself to help someone else.
- What about you?
- I told Kathy I wanna.
Did you check off that little box on your license?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- I know why.
You're afraid to face your own mortality.
"- Well, who isn't?"
If it were some female's handkerchief you would have traced it within a minute.
Look at this!
Uncle will be very happy!
Uncle is very fortunate!
When the rascal Kania doesn't find the dyes his face will be worth a look.

- Hurry up. I'm very hungry.

"Looking at you, who would know that all the girls of Mumbai are stuffed up in your little heart!"
Don't you speak like this!
"As it is, where are the girls in Mumbai these days?"
All of them have become Putlibai's!
What are you doing?
- How fast can you run?
- l see...
You want to enter into a race with me?
Not with you but with this fire!
- You want to race with death?
- Life becomes joyful when one runs holding the fingers of death.
What do you say?
Fire is very menacing.
"As soon as it touches petrol, it shoots out like a bullet."
We are no less.
You are a flame.
And I am fire!
What do you say?
- Let's do it.
- Shall we?
Run!
"As for my abandoning Claudia, she and I have come to terms with that."
And I really don't want your opinion on that subject either.
"Well, I should think you'd be happy for her."
"At least now, she has a real man in her bed."
I know what you're trying to do.
And it won't work.
What you and Claudia do is your business.
"I don't wanna hear about it, I don't wanna know about it."
So much for congratulations then.
Adam.
My congratulations to you.
My condolences to Claudia.
"- Hello, darling."
- Claudia.
- You look radiant.
"- Oh, thank you."
You must have had at least four job offers since this morning.
"No, job hunting is a thing of the past."
This came when you left the house.
Listen to this.
"""This is to advise you officially that you've inherited the oil well titled Blaisdel-Lankershim One at the bequest of Walter Lankershim."

It's incredible.
Congratulations.
"Now, have you decided what you're gonna do with your money?"
Aside from buying me an extra Ferrari or two.
But I don't even know how much is involved.
I know there's a lot of it.
I know what I'm gonna do with my independence though.
"Nobody's ever going to treat me like Claudia, the poor relative again."
I'm gonna use it.
"- And you know what, darling?"
I was looking to catch.
I didn't know it was human until I checked the snare this morning.

My detective agency is at your disposal.
"- I appreciate that, Miss Pink."
- How can I help?
I have just learned some distressing news about the baby William and I adopted.
"Well, about his deceased mother actually."
What is it?
She wasn't born with a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't have been Roland's natural mother.
"Well, that must have been a bolt out of the blue."
It never occurred to either of us to question his parentage.
And what do you want me to do?
Find out if his natural mother is alive.
- Can I ask for your discretion?
- Absolutely.
What do you know about the mother and her husband?
Not much.
Nigel Braxton was a safecracker from England.
"His wife, Joanne, was from Stratford, Ontario."
I think her maiden name was Perly.
And they have no surviving family.
- How old is the child?
- About 9 months.
Are you sure that you want to know the truth?
What do you mean?
It's a question that I ask all of my clients.
What I find out for them isn't always what they'd hoped for.
Tells off a Cabinet member like that he's your enemy for life.
Secretary of Urban Development that's the hand that feeds the cities.
"You know, Senator they say a man's stature is determined by his enemies, not his friends."
It also got you the cover of Time.
You're going national Mayor Pappas.
People magazine next.
"That ""stature"" thing."
Who said that?
"I believe I did, a minute ago."
I was having an acute attack of self-importance but it's about to come to an end because here's the man to cut me down to size.
"Kevin, we missed you."
"Sorry, folks."
Didn't mean to interrupt you.
"Kevin's been busy today, I'll bet."
This must be Mrs. Marquand.
It's been quite a day for you.
We don't want any stray bullets around Madison Square Garden.
Ignore the senator.
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
What kind is that?
The kind that'll reelect the President.
Where will you go?
"Second cities, like Chicago?"
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
"The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden, that nominates a Mondale."
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
"Idiot, they must be looking for us."
In one or two days...
Until then we'll have to put it somewhere no one can see.
"I have an idea, What?"
"This is gas, Why did you put it in here?"
See nobody can see it here.
"This car is here for sale, what if somebody comes to buy it?"
"Nobody came to buy it for seven months, who will come now..."
A man's death and another woman over a woman.
"Once catches up with you, it never lets go."
And Yadav's death is catching up to him.
Kill him.
Who shall we send?
"After Heera's murder, Police in Pondi is alert."
I've heard that you have a vacancy for a shooter.
Give my son a chance to do a murder.
I want him to get settled before I'm dead.
His career gets developed.
Give this target to my Laxmi.
I'll do my best.
Give me one chance.
"And if he fails this time, he's not of one father, I tell you."

Bullet will go off so neatly even you won't be able to notice.
But who's the target?
"Poets have poetry, walls have ears."
Leave for Pondi.
Your room will be booked in blue diamond hotel.
You'll get a envelope there.
Whoever's address and photo is in the envelope.
"You mean, sir..."
"You mean, if she was dead, he couldn't get it off?"
"Well, she is, I believe, isn't she?"
"Well, yes, sir."
But he could have asked her for it first.
Before he shot her.
I remember Claire trying to get that ring off at a party once.
Some silly game people were playing.
She couldn't.
Not even with soap.
And you can check that out with her husband.
He was the one that asked her to take it off.
He was on the other team.
"Boy, when you say you studied, you aren't kidding, are you, sir?"
"Well, then, what about the alligator bag?"
An alligator bag that is six years old is apt to be worn-looking.
It doesn't look like it's won'th very much.
It probably isn't.
"How do you happen to know all that much about her bag, sir?"
I gave it to her.
"Well, that takes care of that, doesn't it?"
Right.
"Well, I guess, then there's only the credit cards, sir."
If the killer is an idiot.
"I beg your pardon, sir,"
I don't quite follow your meaning there.
"Well, you don't kill a woman and then sell the credit cards with her name on it."
"The police have been known to bribe fences before, you know."
"Well, of course."
"I'm sorry, sir."
I should've thought of that myself.
"Jeez, I guess you're right, aren't you?"
We will have the time that it takes him
To reach the curb to intercept him.
Steal from the gural nataz?
Are you crazy?
Probably.
But letting a priceless relic
Fall into their hands is not something
I'm willing to let happen.
I'm betting you feel the same.
"No way, it's too risky."
As risky as stealing back
The pendant of tuthankhamen
From their stronghold in izmir?
Or of causing the arrest of
An entire gural nataz cell in malta?
The details of how we recovered
That pendant were never made public.
Be that as it may...
"Professor, his train's on time."
In 30 seconds we'll lose a chance to strike
A blow to the very heart of the gural nataz.
"If this is a setup,"
You won't even have to worry about
The gural nataz...
I'll take care of you myself.

I also want to save the life of a murderer.
Do not condemn you!
Otoharada.
Shut up!
Shut up!
There's change .
To disarm the hostage taker special forces would prepare an assault .
The person whose name is written dies in this book
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds to make that happen
A cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
"The suspect Otoharada, would still entrenched"
But I did find out from NYPD... that Dorothy tried twice in the past six months to have him arrested.
Assault and battery.
So maybe Morty wanted to have a little S8M party... and Dorothy wasn't up for it.
And then Cannata and Doss order a hit... 'cause she snuffed out their old friend.
"Yeah, maybe a vendetta."
Uh-uh.
It doesn't add up.
Yeah.
Why would they wanna risk blowing a multi-million dollar shot... at a casino racket on a vendetta against a cocktail waitress?
"Cannata and Doss, we'll begin with them."
"Switek, Zito, I want video surveillance at Shelborne."
"Gina and Trudy, I want you guys to try to get jobs at the hotel."
"Crockett and Tubbs, Dorothy Bain."
She's the key.
Yup.
You were supposed to get the papers... not start World War Ill.
What?
I don't wanna hear it.
No.
It's not their fault the heat showed up.
It's your fault we're in this mess to begin with.
"You had to place bets with that jackass friend of yours, Price."
"Hey, have a little respect."
The guy's dead.
Yeah.
So is our chances of turning this joint into a legit casino... if we don't beat the cops to them tally sheets.
So they find them.
Big deal.
It's only names and numbers.
Circumstantial evidence.
"They take to the DA... and the next thing we're having lunch with the grand jury, what?"
Okay.
"I repeat, top secret."
KIRBY:
Colonel Cai.
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.
I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff.
The main subject was General Pham Son Ti.
He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south.
Which makes him Number One!
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.
I had my hands on him the last time I was out here.
"But because of political pressure, I had to turn him loose."
Like to get your hands on him again?
Who wouldn't?
"But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment."
- My people think several.
- That brings us up to the plan.
He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley.
"Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes a capture impossible."
Precisely.
Except for one woman and a certain hand-picked team.
"Go on, colonel."
This is the rat.
And this is the trap.
My father was a simple man.
"All he wanted was to be free his wife to love, and his children to raise."
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.
What he didn't realize was that man has to pay a price for that freedom.
"Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty."
Since that day I've lived but with one thought:
Her and me.
"I remember when your coat used to be there, too, Mr. Nash."
I always used to hang mine next to it.
[chuckles] [chuckling] I guess you can tell by now I'm romantic.
You always bought her such pretty things.
Maybe it's not nice of me to talk about the dead.
"You gave me quite a turn coming in like that, Mr. Nash."
"But you had your key, and why not?"
You pay the rent.
"I could smell you'd been drinking... but who could blame you, with all your troubles."
You weren't even sore at me for trying on the coat.
[chuckles]
I guess you never thought I could look so good.
It's that blonde beaver.
It does something for a woman.
Even me.
Such a good father.
"It was so cozy, just the two of us."
Just as if it had always been that way.
And then she came back.
We heard them out there.
"Her and that Mr. de Mario, laughing."
It was shameful the way those two were carrying on.
It really hurt me to see the look on your face.
It was nice of you not to want to be present... when she came in with that boyfriend of hers.
You knew you could trust me not to tell her you were in the bedroom.
"Of course, I don't believe that you had anything to do... with what happened later."
"But you see, it's the police I'm worried about, Mr. Nash."
Maybe tomorrow they'll ask me about you.
So I thought if we could get together....
"You know... dinner for two, tête-à-tête."
[bell buzzing]
It wasn't human.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
"We're supposed to have a nice lazy Sunday with friends, and you turned it into a smack down."
I-I promise I'll take care of it.
No.
"No, you said that before."
Give me the contract.
I'll take care of it.
There's a lot riding on this game.
- All right?
- I won't let you and Adam screw it up.
"Uh, Dave?"
You're my ride.
"So, Mr. Campbell, why was your accountant giving you investment advice?"
Talked me into this limited partnership deal in Arizona.
Son of a bitch cost me $2 million change.
"And Mr. Roberts wasn't licensed as an investment counselor, was he?"
"No, he's my--"
He was also a friend.
So was he advising you as your accountant or as your friend?
"Listen, Mr. L.A. Law, I'm not on trial here."
All right?
So just stop grilling me and do your job.
Unless you want to try for a matched set.
"I am doing my job, Mr. Campbell."
But if I'm gonna take your stupid case into open court...
I'm gonna need more than a girl fight between friends.
Excuse me?
"'Cause you've got crap for a case, Mr. Campbell."
And the jury's gonna take one look at your fat ass and say--
- What?
What?
Did you hear what he just said?
"- He's not starving, and he's blaming a friend for his own stupid mistakes, so good luck finding a lawyer dumb enough to take you on."
And?
I haven't come up with anything conclusive.
"I'm not an expert or anything, but I have a theory."
Yea?
I figure...
I figure heaven...
"is probably a place where, nobody cares how big or small you are, or what you look like."
People probably don't even have bodies.
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.
"But if they do have bodies, everyone's gotta be naked for sure, cause that's we all showed up here in the first place, right?"
"And also, if you have a back problem... or bad knees or self-esteem issues."
That stuffs won't bother you anymore up there.
And everything's free too.
Or at least whole sale.
"I don't know if there's animal, but that'd be cool."
"Oh yea, and when you walkin' in to the gate for the very first time."
They're probably playing' that Louis Armstrong's song.
Somethin' nice like that.
Part of this came from this girl I knew.
She died.
It's a long story.
"Anyway, she thought everybody would be naked, that part was her idea."
- How did she die?
- I don't wanna talk about it!
"I mean, I do but... when I tried, never works."
Maybe someday.
Wow!
Sit up.
Who wants some snack?
You know what?
Wow!
- This dealer hasn't violated any state or federal laws?
- No.
- Hotel or Gaming Commission policies?
- I don't believe so.
"And there's no acts of moral turpitude, no guest complaints?"
What about the boss's complaints?
You have no grounds for dismissal.
And I assume I can't fire you for providing completely disagreeable advice.
I can't fire him.
Happy?
I'm so sorry.
"Well, don't celebrate too much."
I have a plan.
Can't wait.
I want you to find a cooler.
"Did you just say a ""cooler""?"
"Yeah, I just said a cooler."
Right.
"Monica, I know people talk about coolers, oh, and they made the movie, but, uh, there's no such thing as a cooler."
Did I hear someone mention a cooler?
"Hi, Monica."
Because I am one.
"Every time I go to a table, whoever's there starts to lose."
"Doesn't matter how much they were winning before, I show up, everything heads south."
It's wacky.
"Delinda, I want you to go over to that table... and stand as close to the dealer as you can get."
- I don't want to make people lose.
"- Oh, I guess I'd call it an order."
I'm just here to try to patch things up with my father.
We're not really speaking.
I work at Pure.
"Oh, my mistake."
"Hello, Congressman Pierce, Mrs. Pierce."
We are here from the White House on behalf of the Families First Bill.
"Oh, yes."
"Mom, the White House here to see me."
We need you to vote for the bill.
"More importantly, the president needs you to vote for the bill."
The president?
The president sent you here to talk to me?
She used sentences containing your name.
"Okay, I'm in."
"I mean, yeah, absolutely."
- Fantastic!
"- Mom, the president needs me to..."
"Oh, no, Joker and Penguin beat us to it."
"Hey, guys."
You're here just in time to celebrate.
The congressman is going to vote yes on the Families First Bill.
"It was a personal request from the president, so..."
"Congressman, now, while I respect your decision, you do understand that the amendments to this bill will negatively affect your district."
Hardworking families don't want to support lazy ones.
And your support will shrink faster than a penis in the December Hudson.
- Really?
- You shit-eating cocksuckers.
"- Whoa, whoa!"
"- I'm sorry, Mrs. Pierce."
How dare you come in here and try to strong-arm a person when he's sitting at his sick mother's bedside?
"That's exactly what you just did, dumbass."
Don't tell me what I did or did not just do.
Could you guys please keep the noise down?
There's a lot of really sick people on this floor.
"Yes, there are."
I see two very sick people.
Thirty-six?
"Wake up, number 37."
Wake up

This one son of a bitch is still out there and I promise you we're gonna get him.
That's what makes you a great CSI.
"Cetral dispatch, go ahead."
"Control, this is One-David-Two."
I have a 444.
Officer down in the alley north of the 800 block of Rayson Street.
Requesting three backup units and paramedics.
I am in pursuit of the suspect.
"Suspect is a white male, possibly armed, wearing dark clothing, traveling southbound toward Malpassat Road."
Officer down.
Repeat.
Officer down.

All officers respond.

Which is to our good fortune.
Still havin' you here with us.
"So happy to keep you happy, Daddy."
Livy and Ellie are waitin' on me.
We're goin' to the suffragette rally this afternoon.
"Do you want to come, Tootsie?"
I promised Abigail I'd baby sit little Camden.
"What about Annie Laurie's tea dance, Zelda?"
Isn't that today?
Those affairs are insufferable.
"More so than the ""insufferablegette"" rally?"
I find it gratifying that
Zelda has so many activities to choose from.
"Well, I'm off to march, wave signs and shout slogans that would curl your hair."
Nothing to love about women voting.
Sorry I'm late.
Your family takes forever to eat lunch.
- Livy.
"- Well, she's right, Ellie, they do."
I thought you changed your mind.
I wouldn't miss this.
"It's historic, and happening right here in little old Montgomery."
Not to mention it's something to write about in your next letter to Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.
"Dearest Scott, the rally was ever so amazing."
"Why do you keep writing him, anyway?"
"Well, just because I told him I wasn't gonna marry him doesn't mean I can't correspond, does it?"
"- Come on, Zelda."
- Whatever is the matter now?
"I'm comin', I'm comin'."
Woman:
Votes for women.
Violets for votes.
"At this moment, I can't say."
I will be in touch.
Thank you.
She's gone!
"I came back from the Station House to set up for the show,"
- and she was gone.
- Has this happened before?
She's never been set free.
I don't know what she's capable of.
"This lock, it's faulty."
Did you not notice?
"Sure if I noticed, I would have fixed it, wouldn't I?"
This means the girl could have gotten out the night of the murder.
(indistinct chatter)
Constables will pair off and search for this girl in an orderly fashion.
The local farmers who are upset about their dead livestock will be joining us.
"The armoury has been opened, but only use force if necessary."
"Having said that, be cautious."
This girl could be vicious.
"Crabtree, bring the lads up to speed."
(small chuckle)
Our little man doesn't seem too harmed by his day with the nanny.
I won't be staying for dinner;
I'm joining the search for the missing young woman.
You think she could be the killer?
"I don't know, but I'd rather a mob didn't decide."
- Still have no idea who she is?
- No.
"But in spite of Mr. Travis' claims, she wasn't always feral."
"At the very least, she had a mother who gave birth to her."
"Yes, she did."

I missed it 20 long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and they murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust He called me brother
My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me!
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!
One word from him and I'd be back
"Beneath the lash, upon the rack"
Instead he offers me my freedom!
I feel my shame inside me like a knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
(WEEPING)
Is there another way to go?
I am reaching but I fall
And the night is closing in
As I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin
You're lying.
"- Marcy, no..."

A man broke into my car.
He warned me about you.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Believe me.
"You want to get away from your father, don't you?"
Not like this.
"It's for us, Marcy."
The thing is...
I'm gonna need that money back.

"The posts that you're referring to,"
Raina told me about them weeks ago.
She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.
But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
Not one word of what she wrote was actionable.
So if you think you're gonna turn this into a basis of a homicide investigation...
Tendu and I had a meeting.
Two days ago.
What?
"Well, I didn't tell you 'cause I thought if an attorney was there, it might scare him away."
"We met in my office, and we made a deal."
I promised to support indigenous seal hunting if he would come out against commercial seal hunts.
Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.
"Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble."
Can you prove any of this?
I have a draft of the agreement at my office.
We both signed it.
I can send you a copy.
You can ask other people at the meeting.
"My assistant, Tendu's girlfriend, Libena."
Libena-- that's a Czech name.
I guess so.
"I don't know, she had a thick accent."
Why?
Is that important?

Thanks for coming.
Of course.

You don't look so good.

He bit me.
You know what happened to that little dog?

But you know what I remember also about that day?
My father was still not satisfied.
So I'm not going to kill you.
I don't think I'm going to get the emotional closure I need out of that.
Instead I'm going to fuck pointy tits over here right in the mouth while you watch.
And then I'm going to have Carlo shoot you in the fucking head.
l might get some satisfaction knowing that you'll go to the great beyond wondering if I'm gonna keep her or kill her.
That depends on how good she is.
Fucking step over here now!
Nice doing business with you boys.
Thank you very much.

"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother is in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?

This is me.
Thank you.

What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.
She says she's the devil himself.
"If you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd realize that's the same as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte."
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.

"And you'll see, she has nothing to do with whatever this is."
She's a good person.
Can a fanatic be a good person?
"In my experience, the answer's almost always no."
She's not a fanatic.
She's... devoted.
Makes it hard for her to keep a schedule sometimes.
Hi.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
I forgot to charge my car last night.
"Hi, hi."
"I am so, so glad that you granted my request for this meeting."
"For ten days in Paris, Aliki bought dresses hats and loads of other pretty things."
"For ten days in London, she picked up some gorgeous furs."
"And the last ten days in Rome, Dimitris, after finishing business, bought her a most elegant and most expensive bracelet."
"So honeymoon came to an end, and Aliki returned to Athens sadder than she was before leaving."
She inadvertently remembered another happier honeymoon she spent with Pavlos in a humble neighbourhood tavern.
"Where would you like to go tonight, my love?"
- Do you know what I feel nostalgic for?
- What?
Something nowhere to be found around Europe.
A small Athenian tavern.
Shall we dine at a Plaka tavern tonight?
"That's a splendid idea, Aliki!"
I'm so glad you show initiative for a change.
"To Plaka, Yannis!"
"What's more, I know a very nice, detached little tavern"
I'm sure you'll enjoy.
- Welcome!
Any preference?
- This table...
It's a nice little tavern!
"You were right, Aliki."
- What will you serve us?
- Old Yiannis will take your order.
"I hope the cuisine is good, too."
"- Oh, Dimitris!"
"- What is it, dear?"
My bracelet!
I must have dropped it in the car.
Your bracelet?
"- Will you, please, have a look?"
- Right away.
"- Good evening, dear Aliki!"
We would both welcome an end to this war.
"By the way, you will let me have that book back if you've finished with it, won't you?"
Sir...
[Distant gunfire and men shouting commands]
[Airplane]
Your unit number?
"I need your name, rank, and regiment..."
[Men speaking indistinctly]
"I'll see if I can help, sir, if that's all right."
Go ahead.
[Airplanes]
[Speaking indistinctly]
I didn't expect to see you here.
"Well, they told me you were back."
And you thought you'd come for David before he scarpered.
No.
I've come to tell you that I know he had nothing to do with the murder.
We picked up 15 of our boys... 15...
And there were thousands of them there.
You've never seen anything like it-- white sand stretching out for Miles...
Ships everywhere-- hundreds of them.
"Motorboats, trawlers."
Picking up 15 here and 15 there.
"You know, we're gonna get the army out of there."
We're gonna do it.
There were bodies.
You saw them on the beaches.
"And as we went in there, the Germans were coming after us-- stukas, dorniers."
"I was lucky, though."
There was some sort of refinery burning and the smoke-- it protected us for a while.
Where is David?
I told you I'd bring him back to you.
"- Good morning, girls."
"- Morning, doctor."
"- Good Morning, Mr. Cross."
- Morning.
"Thank you, Norman."
- Everything's gone wrong this morning.
- Lf you didn't run all the time... .
Ted's bringing the gift.
Rodney.
Here's the speech.
- I'll never memorize this.
- Then just read it.
She's coming!
Miss Thornton's coming!
Hey.
Hey.
"""The job of principal of Peyton Place High School. """
Quiet.
"Ms. Thornton, the senior class has asked me to say a few words and on behalf of them, to present this gift to you."
"""Our names are inscribed inside the cover of that dictionary."
Because there are so many words to express what we feel for you and your long services to the school we decided to give you all the words in the language.
"We're losing you, but to something bigger and more important:"
The job of principal of Peyton Place High School.
"So you'll know we'll never forget you can always turn to the words love, friendship and remembrance and know that we're always thinking them. """
This is the loveliest thing that ever happened to me.
I... .
There's another word in this book.
Gratitude.
"Now, let's talk about graduation."
"I would like a report from the president of the class, Ted Carter."
"Ms. Thornton, I've arranged for all the necessary committees and if they all do their jobs well, I'm sure we'll have a fine graduation."
"Vice president, Selena Cross."
"That's the enemy's goal, no doubt."
He's right!
"Once they take Estabul, they'll take out their anger and hatred, and lengthen the fighting!"
We still have a way.
"You must not falter, Princess."
Rear Admiral Klom's army has surrounded the rebel army's main stronghold.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Withdraw the Roland army and release all war prisoners.
"If they do not heed our wishes, the people of Estabul will be beheaded on the spot."
We sent a letter with that content to the Roland army.
Roland's Hero King couldn't stand by and let commoners die.
How could you?
You're...
I know.
But this cannot be helped.
I wish to protect you...
Princess.
You would take our people hostage for my sake?
!
This is what the people want.
"If we lose now, what would happen to them?"
"How badly would the people of a defeated nation be oppressed, and be disgraced?"
And taking our people as hostages brings them no disgrace?
Can't this be stopped?
It cannot be.
I see.
I am naught but a puppet ruler propped up by others.
"In the end, I couldn't save anyone, could I?"
Princess!
The soldiers of Roland are!
Our army's soldiers are attacking the Estabul fortress!

"Did you organise, facilitate or participate in the murder of Donald Bruce Mackay?"

"On my mother's eyes, I did not."

"Well, your alibi for Friday night's a bit too good to be true, isn't it?"

"And then we broke up, but then we got back together again, and now she thinks that you love her more than ever."
"Oh, honey, I just wanted things... to be better between us."
By doing something completely Shady.
How could I ever trust you again?
Oh...
Honey.
"No, will."
I'm sorry.
"Well, on the plus side he's not getting married."
And you raised a son with enough character... to break up with the wrong girl... even though she has... a truly spectacular set of knockers.
"And the reason I don't have a goiter... is because as an actress, my..."
My vocal chords are so highly developed.
"Well, 's coming."
"Now, um, miss Chase, which of your parents is asian?"
What?
"Well, the disease is only carried... by people of asian descent, so-- ah."
Yes.
"Well, my father, you'll see, is asian."
"Okay, you know what?"
I just--I can't do this.
"You see, I don't really have the disease."
What?
I just said that I did because I thought... it would help me win an emmy.
"Well, that's..."
Reprehensible.
I know.
I--I feel terrible.
As you should.
"Although, in the last week, she has brought the foundation... a great deal of money and attention."
It would be nice not to share offices... with the toenail fungus people.
"Wait, what are you saying?"
"Well, um..."
"As an agent, I will be directing you to do certain things on our behalf."
"And you may be required to testify in court, in future."
"If you disobey my instructions, or conduct any criminal activity, you can be arrested, returned to Canada at any time, from any place and be prosecuted."
"Just in case you were thinking of disappearing in Mexico, taking up the life of leisure with Mr Browne."
You will be paying me for travelling with him?
We will.
And I will get... passport?
Remember...
It can be revoked at any time.
Call George Browne.
"Tell him you've been at the Office all day, you've got your passport... and you'll be at your apartment in an hour."
"I'm sorry I couldn't call, I was at the Passport Office all day."
You can't believe how long it takes.
I will call you when I get home.
"I love you, too."
Very good.
Let's go.
Take this.
It's from Jimmy.
He's gonna call you later and explain.
What's it for?
Francine knows about you.
She's gonna come after you if you show your face around here.
You better go.
"- Hey, Bob!"
"How are you, this evening?"
- Good.
Jimmy's expecting you.
"He's gonna call me, right?"
Take care.
Nice knowing you.
I was the assistant director of the Organised Crime Unit under Inspector Spalding.
Okay.
Mr. Deline.
"You, you and you."
You work pretty fast.
"Well, opportunity knocked, I answered."
Apparently.
"This ghost thing is big, Ed."
"Bookings have skyrocketed, up to a year in advance."
Really?
Yeah.
I guess there's no accounting for taste or judgment.
"Well, that reminds me, I wanna talk to you about Monica's haunted suite."
Listen to me.
"If you mention the ghost one more time like it exists, one of us is crazy and I'm not."
I'm talking about our bottom line.
I've gotten literally hundreds of calls from people wanting to rent the suite.
"Now if the Burkes don't want it, and we buy back Monica's suite and we rent it out..."
Hold it.
It's just...
"No, no, no, no."
I've already run the numbers.
"Even if we pay the Burkes top dollar, we'll still turn a profit within a few months."
We'll make a killing.
We'll make a killing?
"Oh, bad choice of words."
"I've thought about what you proposed, Mr. Burke, Mrs. Burke."
"And since you no longer want the suite,"
"I'm willing to let you out of the deal and, uh, refund your entire purchase price."
"Oh, so now that the place is famous, you want it back."
"Mr. Deline, I am not a fool."
I understand how valuable that suite's become to you.
I was downstairs.
I will kill him if he is seen again.
Send him away from here immediately.
Fine sir..
- Jai..
Coming Vasu
Good Morning madam
Good Morning Karthik.
How are you?
Where are you going quickly Mr. Muthyam?
New sites have come from Pune and I need to show them to Sir.
You said sites and why are there items here?
So are these what you show to Sir daily in the name of sites?
"No sir, these are the sales girls selling us the sites."
"They are not like sales girls, but look very indecent."
"Be quiet, you always get such waste doubts."
"Mr Macha, you please leave."
Not that madam..
- You please leave!
Thank you madam..
"They look a bit peculiar as said by Ratnam sir, madam"
"Looking at this, may be what they wrote in the magazines too is true."
Mr Ratnam!
I ate the salt of your father.
I cannot bear when something is going wrong.
"What is your intention, Ratnam sir?"
Do you doubt that those are not spouses and sir himself has set them up for acting?
"I was into a confusion till now, but it is now confirmed."
Doubt No. 1:
Some fellow had come called sir as brother-in-law.
Doubt No. 2:
"When she was hit, sir is shivering with anger."
Doubt No. 3:
# You've got a friend
# You've got a friend
"# Somebody help me, yeah"
# Somebody help me now
# Won't somebody tell me what I've done wrong?
# When I was just a little boy of seventeen
# I had a girl She was my queen
# She didn't love me like I loved her
# Now I know
# Now I'm so lonesome on my own
# Somebody help me now Somebody help me
"# Somebody help me, yeah Somebody help me"
# Somebody help me now
"# Somebody help me, yeah"
# Somebody help me now
# Won't somebody tell me what I've done wrong?
# What I've done wrong
# All right... #
Subtitles by LeapinLar
Based on the life of Nolberto Coria
Customers were witness to the havoc created.
Some good Samaritans had to help her to get out of the vehicle because she was hurt.
Some gangsters were about to die at the hands of an enraged crowd in Guatemala.
The so-called criminals were whipped and had to walk naked on the streets as punishment.
The crowd thought them guilty of extortion and robberies.
Policemen and soldiers rescued them before they were killed.
A substitute teacher gave a hard punishment to a six-year-old boy...
Hello.
"Yes, madam."
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
What a relief.
I'm glad you're OK.
"[noah] You too, Tensou."
Mm.
Where are the others?
I'm here.
It's still rough out there.
Yeah.
There's squads of those xborgs everywhere.
I stopped by the school.
Kids are working to put things back in order.
We're not the only ones refusing to let these creeps beat us.
But we have to figure out a way to beat that armada.
The world has never seen an invasion like this.
[screaming and explosions] The villains you have fought against this past year were just the tip of the spear.
The armada is an overwhelming foe.
I can't believe the warstar aliens were just the opening act.
Shh.
[banging]
Listen.
[footsteps]
Are you sure you weren't followed? [all sigh]
Dude.
It's just like the first day of school.
"You're late, but you know how to make an entrance."
I've been searching for Robo Knight.
Can you locate him?
"[Gosei] I am sorry, Troy."
I cannot.
The armada has affected our communication systems.
But I know we will beat this new enemy because of your fighting spirits.
It is finally time for you to tap into the infinite power that lines the walls of this command center.
You never said ...um...
the show is not gonna be ready today.
"If we would have known that we wouldn't be ready tomorrow, we wouldn't be playing tomorrow."
I'm slightly irritable beyond slightly... if we don't play tomorrow I'll be really really mad.
Nothing could have been left to fucking bullshit...
"Now, I've wasted all day in doing this, you know,"
I'll probably be up all night with you guys.
In terms of general looks.
Let me just...
do you have a pen on you?
That song should be super-moody...
Help Me I am In Hell should be... you're just watching a light show.
Let's just do this.
We'll start trying to get this to happen.
Tomorrow at noon we'll see where we are.
"You know, maybe everything's done, perfect in time, cool, by this afternoon..."
It's because we have the framework that works.
Here is the other challenge that we never done before.
"Normally the set is orchestrated, started out, come back up..."
"Ok, wait!"
"Ok, wait up!"
We'll be right there!
We're gonna do a little sideburn?
Am I good?
You good.
Check it out.
Hey Trent!
Awesome dude!
You fucking pigs
Fuck you
"Step right up, march, push."
"Crawl right up on your knees, please, greed, feed."
There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel terrible about losing your boy.
But that's on me.
"So if you want revenge, then just shoot me."
You think I blame you for Kevin's death?
Sending those men in was the most courageous thing..
you ever did in your life.
You were a true commander in chief for five minutes.
You just don't have the balls to see the mission through.
What mission?
There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
But there will be.
The Middle East is our last war.
It will be us or them.
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker will be the last American soldier..
to die in that conflict in vain.
You want that as your son's legacy?
Murdering millions of people in his name?
"Mr. President, I wish the pen were mightier than the sword, I do."
But it's just a dream.
"Stand up, sir."
History will judge who the true patriots were here today.
"I've been standing up, Martin, and I'm not gonna open that."
Martin.
"Martin, that's not necessary."
Martin!
How about now?
I can't open this for him.
"If I do, millions of people are gonna die, you understand that?"
I understand.
Goddamn it!
"Tyler, what the hell is going on?"
We got thermal alarms going off in the second floor dining room..
Paa.
- After a fashion.
- Paa...
Do you think maybe she recognizes that I'm Roland's father?
And that's what all the speaking and gestures are about?
It seems to be some form of primitive language.
- Pa.
"- Well, we know she had a father at some point."
It appears so.
- (indistinct conversations)
- I've been expecting your call.
You have?
You don't seem the type of person who's comfortable with unanswered questions.
I want you to keep looking for his parents.
"Well, in fact,"
"I've carried on with my search, anticipating this very thing."
So you have something?
Please tell me it's not a mother pining for her lost child.
Not exactly.
"After her parents died,"
I found out that Joanne Perly left Stratford.
But the trail went cold after that.
So I checked into Mr. Braxton.
It seems he left England for the bright lights of Brantford.
"There, he met and married Joanne."
How did they get Roland?
The woman I think was Roland's mother lived out of town on a homestead.
She went into labour earlier than her time.
"There were complications, and she died."
What happened to Roland?
The rural midwife was the only person present.
She reported that the baby was never delivered.
I was terrible at chemistry.
I'm more of a humanities guy.
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
My PI charged me for three hours so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.
"So this is, what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shakedown racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So, what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard?
This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up but he won't be the last.
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit.
"Right now, you're Fredo."
"But with some sound advice and the proper introductions, who knows?"
"I'll tell you, you've got the right product."
Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch you're on to something special.
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Food for thought, yeah?"
"A once in a lifetime, down and dirty, secret,"
"Prohibition party, in our old so humble ground."
- A what party?
"- A prohibition party, a speakeasy."
Here is how it's gonna work.
"Upstairs, there's gonna be the authority pleasing Great Gatsby party."
"Downstairs, will be a delightful, delicious,"
- Den of inequity.
- You've heard of the 18th amendment?
"You know, alcohol was illegal in the 20s."
Is that why they call it the Great Depression?
"This is absurd, Lizzi is never going to allow a speak-easy."
- Lizzi's never going to know about it.
- Where are we having this party?
What respectable fraternity is ever going to agree to this risk.
It's already arranged.
We're doing it in the KT house.
I still have aches from the last time we partied with them.
Score baby.
I can't believe Casey's endorsing a secret party.
Those girls are super hot.
Rebecca Logan is the hottest.
"Gentleman, please, come on."
Let's respect the ladies and try to stay on point here.
Who here is with me?
It's gonna be awesome.
We'll wear flapper dresses and garter belts.
So we throw this dangerous party.
What do we do if Lizzi finds out about the secret room?
We could loose our social calendar.
What?
That's not acceptable.
Is that what your girlfriend's gonna do?
Alice isn't being called.
Alice ain't your girlfriend.
"The therapist,dr."
"Thorpe, or didn't she tell you she was being deposed?"
Of course she told me.
"You're sleeping with her, so she'll say nice things about you at the deposition.Smart."
"See,I don't have that option."
A--we're not sleeping together.
Sad but true.B-- she's a therapist.She's got privilege.
She can't say anything.
I don't trust her.
I'm not paying.You lost it.
You pay.
"Kids,kids,kids!"
I'm not gonna support you!
We have them dry-cleaned.
"Well, not this one."
Someone was filling these jugs with something.
There's fresh teeth marks from a wrench here.
I pull the damn pipe out.
"What, do they wash the costumes in the sink?"
Drain the liquid into the jugs?
"Ms. Brandt, we need to see the, uh, bills of lading for the costumes from the tour."
And we're gonna need the outbound and return bills.
I didn't see Laura backstage.
I was busy with costume changes.
You were in South America with her.
With the whole company!
"Anyway, I didn't even know her."
"Every time I did see her, she was in one of those rehearsal rooms, by herself, practicing."
People told us you had a bug problem with your costumes?
I only have one set... but I think I'm going to get the other two for Christmas.
What is all that stuff?
"When I get married, all this stuff will belong to my husband and my daughter."
Everything I have here will be theirs.
All of it.
It's my dowry.
This is called a hope chest.
Or trousseau in French.
So Peter was barfing?
I asked the neighbor woman to go get him.
It's like how they say it takes a village to raise a child.
"If you'll excuse me, this is a private call."
So Robby's old enough to walk home alone?
Shit lords!
There's no answer.
Robby loves to answer the phone.
"If he was there, he'd be answering it."
Maybe Peter went out looking for Robby.
"Yeah, see, this is why you don't want a village raising your kid... because there's sketchy parts of the village... and some of the villagers are junkies and child molesters."
I gotta go.
Tell Sven that Robby's missing and I had to go.
Thanks for calling.
"For customer service or furniture or mattress delivery inquiries, press 4."
"For bridal registry, press 6."
- Mann res-
- Is Robby here?
- Mann residence.
May I help you?
- Is Robby here?
No.
"If you didn't know me, would you think I was really this tall... or would you think I was standing on something?"
You're here.
"Back in my slut-around days, as soon as I would roll into a club,"
I would lock down the hottest beef on the grill.
"If some club skank tried to snatch my catch,"
"I would hog-tie the bitch with her own extensions, and I would take back my man!"
"I would claim that ""D""!"
You know what I'm saying?
I really don't.
But I can't wait to hear how it ties in with children.
"If you and the kids had such a great thing, why should you let another teacher"
- step in and take over?
- You're right!
That was my class.
"I mean, I took those kids on a funky-fresh trip to 1990 and back."
You know what time it is?
Time to... ♪ pump up the jam ♪
Yay!
Roger Frank is gonna rue the day
- he took on Andy Torres.
"- Okay, remember, if we get made, we finger the council and say everyone's on the take."
Where did you learn all this cool con-man lingo?
What do you think?
Law school paid for itself?
"Now, then, it is time to serve"
Roger Frank and his Dustybear Financial a little slice of payback pie.
Dustybear Financial-- why does that sound familiar?
- Boo!
Don't let the payback pie get cold!
- Right!
"- Oh, hey!"
Are you here for the show?
- I don't know.
"Grayson texted me and said,"
That guy who was just here.
He's a special cop trained to track down foxes.
Special cop?
Didn't you watch that documentary on TV?
Everyone knows after watching that.
We have no time to watch TV.
"Wait, wait!"
There's a way that the special cop tracks down foxes.
He was testing you before.
The 'yes or no' thing.
That's exactly his method.
"Yeah, I was really confused before."
You're dead!
Will we eat him or not?
- What?
- Let's eat him after we talk.
"My sweety, be patient."
"- Now, keep going."
"- According to America's MK report, the number of foxes pretending to be human came out to 3,824,790.5 across the globe."
What's the 0.5 for?
Did I say that?
"Well, that one's a mixed blood."
So they organized the F.T.B.H.
The Fox-To-Become-Human secret community.
They kill people at will.
That's nonsense.
We don't kill anyone at will.
"Since we have to eat human liver on the 1000th year to become human, we don't kill anyone beforehand."
Right!
Rumors are always exaggerated anyway.
"Anyway, if you kill me now, you will be arrested by the police who are waiting to find evidence."
"Fox fur coats sold like hot cakes on the home shopping channel the other day, you know."
Thank you.
I still can't believe that guy kept us there for no reason.
I don't know.
I think his reasons are pretty good.
"When a guy gets around a girl he's crazy about, sometimes reason goes out the window."
He forgets to take things slow.
"Well, sometimes, when a girl gets around a guy she's not too crazy about, she does some pretty stupid things, too."
I'm sorry for posting your mug shot up in the ladies' room at Taylor's birthday.
"Well, it showed a lot of creativity."
"Speaking of creativity, Caitlin... clown porn ?"
I'm not even going to ask where that came from.
I found it in Dr. Robert's study.
You guys will believe absolutely anything.
"Hey, Frank, have you ever considered cutting your hair ?"
Is that Seth ?
"Oh, my God, pull over."
"Mom, I'm really sorry I shot you."
"I know we don't always get along, but..."
I really love you.
"I love you, too."
I... don't think I've ever heard you say that before.
"Taylor, that's why I went to Julie's."
"After the earthquake happened, all I could think about was you."
"Oh, my God, Mom, me, too."
I was shot because I was such a total failure as a mother.
It never even occurred to you that I would come looking for you.
But you did.
So...
So.
Mom...
Hi.
"I guess this is the point where I'm supposed to tell you that you gave us all quite a scare, except I was never scared."
"That must put the total around 500,000 yen."
"I think that would be about right, but I'll check."
"No, need to do that."
Just deposit it for me.
I'll do it.
"When Japan lost the war, it lost its spiritual beauty."
Yagi says that Freedom has been haunting Japan for quite some time.
"Does the curse of that old ghost cause your troubles, too?"
Yagi is really worried that the jobs and kimono will run out.
There isn't much left.
"I'm even going to sell the ""Hana."""
"Namiko, let's make a clean break with the lies of our twenties."
How?
Leave.
Leave and do what?
Come live with me.
Why didn't you say that twenty years ago?
"I thought a woman's happiness was in marriage, so I held back."
But it's still true that a woman's happiness is in marriage.
We've been seeing each other as friends for twenty years.
We can't live this lie any longer.
"For Yagi's sake, for your children's sake, please."
Leave him.
For twenty years I've lived for my daughter.
I wanted her to be a ballerina.
"That is my great, unfulfilled wish, but it's only been an excuse to live."
It didn't make me happy.
My wife left me with a child.
I want you to be the mother of my child.
I don't want to hear that.
You don't know what I'm going through now.
Stay in your position after your pirouette.
How about our favorite croupier?
"Mr. Stone was arrested when the ship docked in Miami, along with Mr. Stancati."
The cruise line is very grateful.
They even offered you all a free trip.
"If it's okay with you, Charlie, I think we'll stick to dry land for a while."
"Congratulations, angels, and, Kate, I want you to know how proud I am of you."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Interesting place to meet.
Somehow it just felt right.
How's rehab going?
- Slowly.
- You're a fighter.
"You know, I'm never going to be able to repay you."
Why did you help me?
"- Always with the questions, you."
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"It's, uh, it's a force of habit."
"You know, I tried to tell myself that taking dirty money was just a one time thing..."
"That I could walk away, but I couldn't."
"Once your story broke, it helped me realize who I had become."
That's a first.
I have never been thanked for destroying someone's career.
"I wish I could say,"
I took those bribes because I had no choice.
"Fact is, I thought I was putting bad money to good use."
Spent it on the people I loved.
"Put my brother through school, paid my mom's mortgage..."
"Called myself a hero, but I wasn't."
"Well, to be fair, you got mixed up with a very bad crew."
I think I've got much better taste in friends now.
So this new career...
!
"If you want this to finally end, yes."
"No, I can't do that."
I got pride.
I'm strong.
No woman wants a man who files a restraining order in the face of danger.
I want an erection!
"How many times in life do you get a second chance, granddad?"
A chance to fix your biggest mistake?
Fine!
I'll find someone else to make me a master swordsman.
"Riley, look up ""master swordsman."""
Private lessons.
"You know I don't like a lot of people around me when I'm sweating, oh, and not too expensive."
"Uh, we're broke."
"Oh, somebody's calling me on Skype!"
Nobody ever calls me on Skype!
"What's good, nigga?"
!
Bet you weren't expecting this face!
"I'm surprised you can still see after what I did to ya, you bitch-ass, faggot ass, bitch-ass faggot!"
"Damn it, how'd you figure out how to call me on Skype?"
!
I don't even know how to use this shit.
"Hey, nigga, I just wanted to let you know that if you not too much of a pussy-ass nigga, you can meet me tomorrow in the parking lot for a rematch!"
"Oh, and I put the word out to the whole world, so if you don't show, well, you know what that means."
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
Bitch-ass.
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
"Yeah, rock with me, Robert!"
Come on!
Something's wrong.
I need another.
- I'll do it.
- Go climb at the terrace... and stand on the other side of the balcony rail.
"Pierre, mon cher, we need a vision."
"The year, 1323, no... 1324."
The setting:
"A stony alcove in the alps of the Capuleto... hanging from the rocky, gelid cliffs of Stratfordshire."
"Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a post perceptive chilling the air."
"The tempest has fled to bomir pastures, but its icy kiss lingers."
The mood:
Unbridled passion... a passion that unravels nature's tiring volcanoes... and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods... so is this union.
You need to show Romeo and Juliette how to pose.
And you can bet your sweet ass I will.
Romeu:
"You've just been running in from Mars... you're hot and sweaty, but you're taking some danger."
"Juliette is looking hot, you know what I'm trying to mean?"
"I want the body language to be a lot more charged, okay?"
So move a lot tight closer together.
"Look into your Juliette's eyes and...""Oh!"
"Romeo, Romeo""..."
"""where art thou"", boy."
"Come on, open your heart... and show some love, some affection for her."
And Juliette... you love this man!
Oh!
Yes!
You know he's your knight in shiny armor.
I like that!
"Hold that, I'm gonna take some Polaroid photos."
"Alex, move your ass."
Move your ass.
"Out, please."
"But, uh, it turns out an antiques dealer"
Had it in Tokyo in the 1920s.
Now it's here in Washington.
"Artie, it's at the secret service."
What the hell's it doing there?
"Well, the Japanese government presented it"
In the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace.
Guess that didn't work out so well.
And the curator at the Wilson museum of peace
Made the connection a couple days ago
And offered it to be united with the sword
At the gift ceremony.
"But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremonies,"
So it's going back to the museum in the morning.
The sword and the tsuba in D.C. at the same time.
"No, no, no."
That's--that's too much coinc--
Too much coincidence.
"Well, Artie, we're sitting on the secret service building."
"But, look, if this thief is--is coming to get the tsuba,"
We have to warn Dickinson.
"No, no. absolutely not."
"Well, Artie, you saw what this guy's willing to do."
"Yeah, and--and so did you."
And imagine what he's capable of with the sword.
"No, no, no. this thief is ruthless and smart."
"So if you warn the secret service,"
And they do anything out of the ordinary--
Anything at all-- then he will be tipped off.
So you want to use him as bait.
"- No, Artie."
No.
Don't bother about it.
Since when was he staying here?
They vacated last week.
THEY vacated?
How many people?
"This guy, and another man with you."
What was the other man's age?
- Probably within 30.
Take the register and look for the entry.
Here.
This one?
"SIRI, call."
98942-83-834.
"The phone number, address, and other information from the lodge are fake."
The number is registered on a fake company's name.
They have been using it illegally.
The SIM had been active till his death.
Now it's not in use.
What about the incoming and outgoing call details?
Not too many calls.
But there are repeated calls from a number.
The number that ends with 333.
I enquired about that as well.
That's also illegal.
Not in use.
Did you get information about the other guy in the lodge?
We didn't get enough details about him.
There is just one window open for investigation now.
We have to find the one who killed him in the accident.
Our program's main concept is to find information about the unidentified dead people.
We can enquire about the rest later.
Looks like I often have to remind you who's the cop.
- Then you must not give up.
There's no one here with a greater love or-or knowledge of music.
And that's the key.
You must show him... that his musical career is not over.
You can't let him waste that precious talent that God has given him.
"Thank you, Father."
"""Big surprise dinner party."""
"""Spectacularly unforgettable."""
Did you ever consider renting your mouth out to the motor pool as a garage?
"Beej, if we don't come up with something soon... we're gonna be modeling the latest in tar-and-feather wear."
- Let's attack this rationally.
- I'd rather attack you irrationally.
Come on.
Think back.
You remember some special dinner party you once went to?
Sure.
Lucia Murphy's 1 4th birthday.
We played spin the bottle and sent out for Chinese food.
"Now, there's a nice touch of home."
Dinner just like Mao used to make.
"Hawk, admit it."
No matter what kind of spectacular food we come up with... as soon as it hits those tin trays on those crummy tables in that rotten tent... it's still gonna be a mess.
So we won't have it in the tent.
What can we eat outside?
- Dirt.
- No!
A picnic!
We'll have a cookout.
Wait a minute.
Wait a-
- W-W-Wait!
I just got a great idea that will save us from a lifetime of death.
The deadly sins start to infuse their way into the painting.

Man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of its civilization...
"The burning of coal, oil and wood is releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."
The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now.
Guess where the temperature goes?
It goes up.
Climate change is already in our backyards.
It's official. 2012 was the hottest year in the  2013 ... 2014 ... 2015 ... warmest year around the globe ... warmest year on record.

"But you're tramping through my backyard,"
"Literally tripping over my agents,"
And you don't even give me a heads-up.
We have explicit instructions not to contact you any more.
Artie Nielsen.
"Look, it's not like we can't have coffee now and then."
We just can't have you on speed dial.
Look.
I get it.
For better or for worse-- and I happen to think worse--
You two are serving a new master.
This isn't your screw-up.
It was his.
It's just that he doesn't really...
Play well with others...
- Hmm.
- So much.
"So this security officer, Ogawa, Japanese embassy,"
Is waiting for my explanation of what you were doing
And if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was.
Any suggestions what I'm supposed to tell him?
All right.
Do me one favor.
Get on a plane and leave D.C. while I can still let you.
Can I at least have that?
Be out of here as soon as possible.
I don't think this is what Dickinson had in mind.
"Well, what are we gonna do?"
Poison?
Yes.
The kind that kills innocent young doctors.
"I don't know anything about poison and even if I did, I wouldn't say anything."
"If you want to survive around here, you see nothing, you hear nothing and you say nothing."
You gave your child to the Church?
"Yes, to Sainte-Genevieves."
Sainte-Genevieves?
Yes.
A refuge for orphans and families just outside of Paris.
"They feed them, clothe them, teach them a trade."
"Hopefully, something not the same as mine."
"Here, take another day off."
My saucy little Hector!
Yes!
I think I may return to my rooms.
"No, you will stay here with me."
"Otherwise, I shall have no one to talk to and that will be embarrassing."
As you wish.
Bitch!
I tbelieve you delivered this to the wrong person.
"No, I have delivered it to the Marquise de Maintenon."
My heartfelt congratulations.
I don't understand.
"Iside, you will find the deeds and title to the Maintenon estate that the King himself offers you, in your name."
This is absurd.
I have no taste for titles and such things.
You soon will have.
"Gaston De Foix's newfound wealth, where does it come from?"

"Well, I thought you might need a friend."
Come and sit.
You realize that she may never talk to me again?
"I told you, 1 9 is too young to be settling down."
"You're driving me crazy, Alex, you realize that?"
Can't help it.
"I've told you, I take getting what I want for granted."
I thought you said you were trying to change that about yourself.
I believe that people should listen to their urges.
"You are a very determined woman, aren't you?"
"Everybody already thinks you did it, Pacey so why don't you just do it?"
This is great.
Too bad we have to stop.

But what about the heat?

It is?
It is.
It would just be inappropriate.

"The man on your cell phone wallpaper isn't this detective here, is it?"
"So cops have affairs, too!"
You had an affair with Ikezawa.
"No, I didn't."
Then why run away with him?
We both knew we were drawn to each other.
"He was an apprentice chef, and I was the chef's wife."
We honestly didn't have a physical relationship.
"When my husband got drunk, he used to get violent and hit me."
The restaurant itself... was renovated from a restaurant that my father had operated.
I was the owner.
My father put in all the money.
My husband had a complex about it.
He would drink and then hit me...
Ikezawa sympathized with me.
He always offered some kind words to me.
But he stole your proceeds.
I suggested we take the money and run.
That makes you an accomplice.
"That's right, I'm just as guilty as he is."
"She won't talk, she wins as long as she keeps silent for 20 hours."
"That's it, I'm taking her in."
Stand up.
I'm taking you no matter what.
Fine.
"But first I need to go to the restroom, okay?"
"Please, pick up!"
"Yasuo, get out of there, hurry!"
A cop came here as a customer and I got caught.

"The next thing I know, this mysterious man, the one you look so much like, Garthe, he wouldn't leave me alone."
"Flowers every day, gifts."
One of the gifts was a job for Ron.
The plot thickens.
I suppose so.
I sure didn't see it at the time.
Ron did odd jobs for him.
It all began so innocently.
And we went out twice.
A limo to pick me up.
Carte blanche at the best shops in town.
So many flowers sent to the apartment that Ron's old allergies came back.
"Well, it sounds all right to me."
All except for the allergies.
What happened?
"I've always believed in love and romance, pretty much in that order."
Garthe made it clear that he didn't.
He prefers to buy what he wants.
"Okay, I think I get the picture."
Ron gets suspicious of Garthe.
"Whatever he found out or overheard went into a tape recorder, and the tapes he hid in a locker right before he disappeared."
"I know it's not much to go on, but it's all I've got."
"Michael, something's happened to him and Garthe's behind it, I know it."
"All right, I'll see what I can do."
The key...
Pardon?
You said you'd found the key to the locker.
"Do you know what ""antithesis"" means?"
"""Antithesis""?"
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.
"And the fracturing of his skull: point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
The servants?
They have visitors?
Not at all.
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning...a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's it's very remote."
"No, never mind."
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
Thank you.
It's laughable

And who asked me to set up a new apartment?
I asked!
What's wrong with it.
Every woman wants to have her own home to manage
Do you have your own premises?
"Go and manage them, then."
"--Have you seen those premises, Comrade Vasin?"
--I've seen all kinds of things.
"--Comrade Vasin, read me a fairy tale --You have a daddy, he can read to you"
Gera's busy with his diploma work
"Tell your mommy, if she doesn't like it here, the door is wide open."

"Young man, you have no right to prohibit me in anything"
"--You are an absolute zero --Pavel, stop, it's unbearable!"
I'm in everyone's way
"Pavel, where are you going?"
Can you explain this?
"What, have you lost it?"

"I tell this overgrown boy for 3 years now that the tile is falling out, he won't life a finger!"
"Pavel, I feel so sorry for you"
"I'm just going to ring out my shirt and stuff toilet paper up my nose, and I'm sure I'll have no trouble fitting in now."
"So, thanks."
"Dad, we have to think about the future here."
The only way a company is going to survive a crisis like this is for the C.E.O. to step down.

- That's a heartwarming tale.
- A relaxing weekend at the Montage was exactly what I needed to remind me of what's important
"I know I haven't been there for you, sweetie."
But you haven't been exactly honest with me.

All right.
Honey...
"When Jimmy went down, our marriage fell apart."
I do not want that to happen to us.
"We're partners, which means we share everything."
"So, put me to work."
What can I do...
"talk to the press, make some calls?"
- Kirsten is taking care of all of that.
"- Well, she can't do everything."
- Surely there's something I can do.
"- There is one thing, but..."
- Name it.
- Food.
"- Since I'm going to be working from home, we're going to need some water, some coffee, some of those pumpkin muffins I like"
"Thanks, JuJu."
"Kirsten, Sandy?"

Go!
Move!

"This is yet another liberal attack on our values, our families and on our way of life."
"On the subject of gay marriage, remember this, people."

"Good night, everybody, and thanks for watching The O'Bannon Files."

"Arbor's gone, sir."
Missed his assignment in Seattle.

I'm not sure what happened.
He just vanished.
"So the guy doesn't complete his assignment, and you have no fucking idea where he is."
This is unacceptable.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I'm gonna make it right.
I have Senate Oversight all over my ass.
And I'm meeting with the director tonight.
The last thing I need is a failed assignment by a rogue agent who disappeared and didn't follow orders.
He is your man.
He is your responsibility.
- Nobody likes finals.
Thank God I'm graduating and it's the last time I cram like this.
My pursuit of higher education has led me... to an interesting discovery about myself.
You wanna hear it?
- Sure.
- I despise academics.
"Learning, knowledge, it's all worthless."
I have no idea what you see in it.
Learning is fun.
"Plus, for me, there's that I'm a minor, so it's mandatory thing."
That's what kills me.
This is self-inflicted.
I'm a masochist.
I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.
That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile.
I guess.
Unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.
- You're graduating.
- I know.
"No, you're graduating."
There's gonna be a ceremony.
I don't know.
It's a community college.
Community colleges have ceremonies.
My college doesn't even have a lawn.
They won't necessarily have a ceremony.
- They must.
Did you ask?
- No.
"Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about... some cheesy ceremony for my business class."
- When is it?
- I don't know.
"Unfortunately, there is no time rest."
"Come on, dude."
We'll also have something to eat.
There are only 100 days left for the exam.
Do we even have time to eat?
If I have to calculate; we have 6 hours of school everyday that makes 18 days.
We have 82 days left.
"If we take an hour or an hour and a half lunch break... that makes 9 days, 73 days left."
"But hey, I thought we'd solve the problem we've been dissolving ourselves."
What is this dude?
"8 hours of courses on the weekends, makes 5 days."
We now have 68 days left.
We sleep for about 8 hours a day.
That makes 34.
We're left with 34 days.
Extra lessons for 3 days a week 3 hours each; adds up to 6 days. 28 days left.
We spend a lot of time on the road...
"We also have to shower, go to the bathroom, wash and iron clothes."
We should also count the homework and these meetings too; 5-6 hours a... day.
We have 3 days left.
"For your information, in 3 days, he'll say, ""Let's steal the questions."""
You can't imagine how happy you have made me.
"So, I'll be able to see you as a university student."
Of course you will mother.
Why shouldn't you?
Hey guys!
Hello man.
You look great.
You look just like one of us.
"Hey, you look really smart."
It's not enough to just get dressed in a smart way.
"Hi girl, you are back!"
"Mike, come on -- too dangerous."
"Sam, this whole thing with..."
"losing Elsa, I just..."
"Yeah, well, doing something insanely dangerous won't fix what happened with me and Elsa."
I don't see another way.
"All right, then."
Let's go do something insanely dangerous.
This place is like a black market Costco in here.
"Yeah, well, I'm kind of a big deal."
That's why I'm able to smuggle super-spies to other countries.
"So, guys, what's the plan?"
All right.
Here's how it works.
"Every time you make a delivery from a warehouse,"
"Jabbar finds out, right?"
"Yeah -- come looking for me, and then they steal everything."
"Okay, so, now you're gonna call in a pickup from this warehouse."
"Only this time, Jabbar's guys are gonna find a very unhappy ex-employee of yours here."
E-e-ex-employee?
What --
That's what Mike and Fi are setting up in your office.
Mike gets the guys to take him to Jabbar.
We sic the FBI on him -- problem solved.
"Oh, problem solved."
You guys just skipped over the part where I lose everything I own!
Shut up.
"Listen, Mike's doing the hard part here, okay?"
"All you have to do is make the call, wait for Jabbar's guys to show up, and run like hell."
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
I hate this plan.
This is a horrible plan.
Push the button.
I think today would count...as one.
You know what I think she would like even more... is to see you wear it.
I couldn't possibly take it...
"Be careful, be careful this won't heal if you move around too much."
"If you want to help, tell me about that prison."
What kind of security do they have?
"Are there force fields, detection grids, physical barriers?"
"Yes, all of it."
What about guards?
Lots of guards.
The Mokra make a big show of it... always bragging about how no one has ever escaped.
Listen to me...
I can't bring you to the prison with me.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not afraid.
And that could get both of us killed.
You have to stay here.
If I stay here I can't bring the letters.
Letters...to the prison?
Letters.
Don't you remember how we used to write to her together?
Here they are.
I still write them... every week since she's been gone.
I've always known that one day
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.
I've never forgotten.
These are all to your wife?
How long has it been?
My last letter... my last letter's not... it's not here.
"Oh, I wrote it three days ago, butit's...is not..."
"I can't let her think I've stopped writing... that I gave up hope only, only days before..."
Would that I could have sustained that moment.
"Ah, no matter."
Do you have a last request?
If you think I'm going to obediently stick my head in that noose--
You still haven't learned.
You have no choice.
"Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome."
It's all so very easy.
"That's your problem, Trelane-- everything's easy."
It's given you a bad habit.
"You're not aware of it, but you have it."
"You don't think, Trelane."
That's your problem.
"You miss opportunities,"
like your anger before and mine right now.
"Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why?"
"Because you're a bumbling, inept fool."
"Take care, now."
"Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it."
You want to commit murder?
"Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging?"
The sport?
"Yes... the terror of murder, the suspense, the fun."
"Oh, I'm intrigued."
"Go ahead, Captain."
What do you suggest?
"A personal conflict between us-- not like the duel before, but the real thing."
The stakes?
A human life--mine.
Oh... yes!
Yes!
That's the idea.
"It's called grieving, Shay."
"It got embarrassing, Arlo."
"Hey, hey."
"Look, what I'm trying to say is maybe her process hasn't started yet."
Did she tell you about the postcards?
The ones her mother supposedly sent from all over the world?
"Wait, so someone was trying to pretend her Mum was still alive even though she's been dead all these years?"
"Unless Trina sent them from beyond the grave, it looks that way."
"What, like someone was trying to cover up her murder?"
"Well, there are other explanations."
"Well, yeah, but not as cool."
Some revision still might be a good idea.
"If you want, I can help."
"It's Media Studies, Arlo."
"It's not like brain science, or whatever."
You sitting an exam today?
I kind of have too.
"Well, couldn't you get a dispensation, given the circumstances?"
"Nah, I did like no work all year, so if I don't pass the exam I am sunk."
Oh.
Eggs?
Poached not fried.
Two.
"With avocado, not tomato."
"But hey, the good news is this is the last exam, so once it's over it's party time!"
Yay!
My God!
"Your mother is dead, Lindsay."
You can't just pretend it didn't happen.
Shay.
Look...
"I get that you were all totally gutted when your Mum died, but mine chose to leave us."
That picture was taken after the attack at the ruins.
Three weeks ago?
!
Why didn't you tell me about this?
!
it's obvious that they're targeting you.
That's too great of a risk for us.
my friend was used as a human bomb!
Are you asking me to look away on this one?
Noah's ark is a very dangerous ruin.
I can't let you go there in the state you're in.
this mission is too much for the injuries that you've incurred.
and...
You must be joking!
A challenge has been directed straight at me!
I'll settle this myself!
Yu!
Here you go.
Thank you.
Professor Mayzel is researching the spot.
Doc Mayzel is..?
This plane is now entering Turkish air space.
An unknown fighter of unknown origin has ordered us to change our course.
Our permission to land from at Devas airport from ground control has been cancelled.
We are now heading for Istanbul.
agents from the Turkey branch of the Arcam Foundation are working to make alternate travel arrangements.
what a tender welcome.
Did you come to fight a war?
Seize them!
I'm very sorry about that.
We were supposed to have had an agreement.
let's just take it easy.
But all right tell me something you've done in the last four years.
That's the least bit out of the ordinary.
"Other than that bizarre ""Stanford whoo"" thing."
Are you kidding me?
The last four years of my life have been anything but ordinary.
Wonderful.
How?
I can't tell you.
Then I can't reconsider your application.
"But if I could tell you You'd be all ""nuh-uh."""
"And I'd be like ""yuh-huh."""
"And you'd be like ""no way""."
"I'd be like ""yeah way""."
"Wait, please."
I never even got a cookie.
[Singing] If you're wondering what she'll do.
Now that her plans have fallen through.
And you know she's got a real strong will.
And she's got lots more show to fill.
"Now she's going, going back to Malibu."
We kinda thought we'd be singing too.
Instead we're stuck in her chorus line.
[Chuckles]
'Cause your agent's not as good as mine.
"Wait, wait, if Miley leaves, we have no ride."
Hey Miley how far away are you?
I'm turning into the driveway and I'll be in in a second.
Hey I know you're disappointed so I'm making your favorite dinner.
Mac and cheese and bacon!
That's your favorite dad.
"You know the way she's feeling, that probably wouldn't have made any difference anyway."
This way at least one of us will be happy.
"Mr. Moreau, excuse me."
They just informed me
Which unfortunately our president will arrive later.
We can offer a visit to His Majesty and to the Belgian Ambassador
Of the Miniatiürk Park while we are waiting?
"Mr. Moreau, what about the Atomium?"
"The Turks have a lot to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,"
Commander of the Turkish forces in the War of Independence
And founder of the Turkish Republic.
And they expressed their gratitude by building this colossal mausoleum.
Freedom or death.
"He was a man with a clear vision, did not he?"
Yes.
"We all admire Kemal Atatürk, His Majesty."
"Listen to your vision, Turkey today would be a very different country."
This is the last reappearance of the king running in the park like a puppet.
There was going to be a news bomb and there would not be a script.
Ludovic!
Wallonia has declared independence!
Belgium collapsed!
Their declaration of independence is called 'We're Tired'.
Fed up?
About what?
"The valleys feel faint, humiliated, and misunderstood by the Flemings."
They are tired.
We must go back to Belgium immediately.
We will arrive at the airport in ninety minutes.
Ready?
Could you repeat that?
His Majesty the King wishes to speak to the Minister-Walloon President.
Ready?
Ludovic?
It's fucking amazing.
Do you know how few people reach this level?
You seem to not care.
I really don't.
Did you ask me here so you could talk about yourself?
Next question.
Does talking about this stuff make you feel happy?
No.
I find thinking about it all to be unfulfilling and exhausting.
Does nothing for me.
"Well, that's how the rest of your life is gonna be."
Unfulfilling and exhausting.
I think success has made you ugly.
"I think you've gotten far too in touch with your selfish instincts, and it's not healthy."
But I still think about you.
I think the guy I used to know would have made a really great boyfriend.
I want to take that cupcake out of your hand right now and throw it so fucking far away from you.
"Goddamn it, you make me sick."
You're just a big baby.
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.
You're the worst.
"I'm not successful, I'm notable."
There's a difference.
"Besides, I'm not notable, either."
Noteworthy at best.
I once considered you my favourite ex-girlfriend.
That's very sweet of you.
Let's...
"let's turn this day around, do something fun."
"Maybe, I don't know, break into a bank, or rob a car or something."
"- All right, let's do it."
- Sorry to barge in on you.
"- No, no, no, no."
I'm just watching your girl.
- First female prime ministers?
- They were great leaders.
Would you put Thatcher in that category?
"No, I don't think so."
- You know what?
I would have to say Thomas Jefferson.
- A man?
"- She's something, isn't she?"
- I don't really know her.
"We served together a few years ago, and, I guess... we just ended up in different company."
- Take a seat.
"- Congressman, the president asked us to come down here."
He'd like to let you know he'd appreciate your support in the senator's confirmation.
- Really?
"- He asked me directly, Shell."
But the president didn't consider it important enough to ask me personally?
You know it's important.
It's the old man's swan song.
Putting a woman in office means something to him.
Laine Hanson's the absolute best choice.
You don't believe that.
Come on.
You're too smart.
"Look, I don't mind she's a woman... but I'm not confirming a woman just because she's a woman."
Laine Hanson has an extra burden.
She's has to come on the world stage with perfect credentials.
Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect credentials.
The world respected her.
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher because they knew she had to answer to Ronald Reagan.
- Height?
"- Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What colour hair?
- No hair.
Dude is balder than you.
"1963, James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine."
"1975, breaking and entering."
"1 982, grand theft auto."
"1 984, armed robbery."
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.
"City, state and federal, he's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside."
Entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
Sometime during the Clinton administration Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound of your finest meth."
"Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'll represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
Fifty goes to me.
It's not bad.
But it was slightly unexpected.
"You weren't the person I knew, and you were really lively."
What's wrong?
It's fun.
"Drawing art, and chatting with everyone while streaming."
I want to hear more stuff like that.
I hardly know anything about you.
The reason why I started drawing illustrations was because Mom taught me.
I was naturally doing nothing but drawing since I was little...
And I was a professional before I knew it.
"Mom complimented me, saying it was amazing."
"After Mom was gone,"
I couldn't draw at all.
And I couldn't leave my room.
"But one day, I saw someone streaming."
That person was happily drawing while chatting with everyone.
I was jealous.
"I wanted to be like that, and tried it out."
I see.
It was really fun.
"After seeing the illustrations, they give me their opinions, like ""so cute"", ""so amazing""."
They ask me to draw more.
"I'm still in my room, but I can play and chat with people all over the world like we're friends."
"That, really, really makes my heart race."
I see.
It's the same for me.
The reason I became an author was because the people posting their novels on the internet seemed to have fun.
"There was a time when I wrote novels on the web, too."
That was a great story!
I drew a picture of the Hero Masamune!
"And, I got my first fan mail ever."
"Even if his prohibition is removed, my store is off limits!"
But who is this Unni?
Is she a doctor from the medical team from Korea?
She is!
That ethanol scent!
Who is she?
She is a full-time emergency relief team nurse assigned from Peace Maker.
It seems she works part-time in the hardware store.
"Ah, she does a meaningful job, which doesn't give much money."
"I'm doing it because it's fun, and you don't need money."
"But then Oppa, are you a fortune teller?"
How did you know my full-time and part-time job?
"I think I heard it from Daniel, about his Korean-Russian wife."
"What do you mean ""wife""?"
We're just comrades.
But what did you come here to buy?
There's everything except Daniel.
Can we use the wifi?
Wifi?
"Let's see, the fi is..."
Are you sure that the wifi works here?
"If you search thoroughly, I'm sure they will even have missiles."
Wait here after you finish your business.
It'll just be one hour.
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.
Don't fight.
She has a gun.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
I'm definitely sure there's a modem around here somewhere.
"On Friday at 0900, we apprehended two men who are assumed to be black market dealers, and passed them over to the authorities."
Report complete.
Don't worry about it.
"There's, uh, one more thing."
"Garcia, she asked me about a week ago, who the godparents were gonna be, as in, hello, like I'm right here, like right in front of you."
"She'll be wonderful, but I have a few folks on my side of the aisle lobbying for the same position."
"Oh, Lord."
"So what are we doing, godparenting by committee?"
May have to be.
Derek!
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Some men reach high peaks to leave an indelible memory.
Most of us are content to push forward.
And very few are born to become king.
"Small that camera, is not it?"
"- It's modern technology, Your Majesty."
It's amazing that you can make movies with such a small device.
How big is your team?
- I'm the team.
There's only me.
You're perfect.
"We'll have a nice portrait of you, do not worry."
But you're so tired.
"Sire, allow me, your speech."
Mr Moreau?
- Mr. Lloyd?
I should arrange the microphone at His Majesty.
Of course.
The documentary Our king must point out the king's competence
And his professional commitment.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
And he must grasp his vitality and spontaneity.
Controlled spontaneity.
"But let's say, that this point here is your happy face after those spicy rice cakes."
And here is your nice face worrying about a sick friend.
And here is your face sitting on the toilet.
"If we connect these points, then, we get a shape like this, right?"
Yes.
"But this is something we are not used to, so it's hard to grasp."
"Anyhow, it would still be closer to the real thing than this triangle."
"So if we continue our efforts, we can overcome this stereotypical and evil image."
"We can break them, you know."
So we have to try to see these other points together as well.
You know what I'm saying?
You are amazing.
How did you come up with this?
This is how I'm fighting right now.
That's a really good way to look at it.
Think so?
You really are smart.
Hello?
"I'm sorry, but I'm the person you saw this morning."
I wasn't sure if it was okay to go up.
"Oh, yes."
But I think my wallet is in there.
I can't find it anywhere.
Could you please look for it?
I'm down here now at the front desk.
Wallet?
Where did you put it?
"Well, maybe on the table or the floor."
Or near the bed.
I have important things in there.
"Well, I already cleaned the room and didn't find anything."
Hold on.
We're going home now.
I want us all to have dinner together.
I want the whole family... to stay together.
Please.
The sixth day.
The heavens and earth were finished and all their array.
On the seventh day God completed His work.
God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work.
"Blessed are You, our God, Who creates the fruit of the vine."
"Blessed are You, our God..."
"Alex, why don't you answer my calls?"
Are you afraid?
Are you avoiding me?
The play is about to open.
I didn't have time to call you back.
"Don't lie, I know you're avoiding me."
I'm not.
"It's not only me, it's everyone in the theater."
"We talked, I consulted with them."
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Publicly speaking, there's a problem here."
Publicly?
Do you want to hang him on top of everything?
I can't put a stop to the drift against him.
You are artistic director now.
You're just throwing him to the dogs?
I can't have him back until the trial is over.
And we all feel like we've been betrayed.
How did he betray you?
By fabricating expenses?
Didn't all of you fabricate expenses?
Not in those amounts.
Give me the whip!
"Adios, senor."
"Adios, Satipo."
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
And you thought I had given up.
You chose the wrong friends.
"This time, it will cost you."
"Too bad the Hovitos... don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
"Yes, too bad."
"You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos."
Jock!
Start the engines!
Get it up!
"Jock, the engines!"
"Start the engines, Jock!"
"There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!"
"Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie!"
"I hate snakes, Jock!"
I hate 'em!
Come on!

"All right, let's get back to this site:"
"Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton."
"Contains a central pas-passage and three chambers, or cysts don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow."
This site also demonstrates one of the great dangers of archaeology..
"not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place.."
"no, I'm talking about folklore."
"In this case, local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find."
"Oh, right."
"That's very sensible of you, very male."
"You know, that guy really made me sick."
Hi.
"Leo, I've finished the histology on Dawn Pivcevic and all the organs are normal except for this."
I think the endometrium shows changes of pregnancy and there's a cluster of cells from an embryo.
She was pregnant?
"Yes, just a few days."
You were lucky to sample the right bits for histology.
"They couldn't get pregnant, that's why they'd come off IVF."
It's not unusual for couples to come off IVF and then get pregnant.
That's how Theresa got pregnant with Cassie.
Morning sickness.
She was making the doll throw up.
Who?
The little girl at the scene.
"She wasn't re-enacting Dawn's death, she must have seen her vomiting at some time."
Early stages of pregnancy could bring on nausea and vomiting and faintness.
Especially with the remaining hormones from the IVF.
And if she got a bit tipsy...
She could easily faint.
"How am I going to explain to the husband that his wife, who couldn't get pregnant, got pregnant, which in part killed her?"
If it wasn't so tragic it would be a joke.
Hello.
Hi.
We've met before.
At the garden centre.
"Oh, yes."
Didn't you work for Henry Elliot?
Yes.
"Ah, is Detective Chief Inspector Tom Wimber here?"
"No, I'm afraid not."
I believe it's some kind of weapon.
A picture of my dead mother.
How come you're putting it in the box?
"Because I don't know why my dad keeps all of her pictures hidden in the attic, and tells me she looked like Grace Kelley."
Who's Grace Kelley?
"Oh, she was a very famous clown."
She was a princess.
"And, also..."
I don't know what it's like to have a mother.
We could tell you.
You can't tell somebody something like that.
Have you ever noticed that girls don't fart?
My mom farts.
Looks like a boob.
Yeah.
Make them fly around.
My boob's bigger than yours.
Let's see if you can catch my boob.
"You've got, like, a mosquito bite boob, Frank."
Why don't girls spit?
They're hiding something from us.
The rules have changed.
Gotcha.
"It's a battle of the sexes... and believe me, we are way behind."
Shit!
I can't dance.
"You see this, Frank?"
This little seedling represents an entire species of marsh grass.
"If it lives, the wetlands will survive,"
"Mortlake turtle can return to its natural habitat, and birds like the glossy ibis won't lose another precious nesting place."

"I can see that he harbors great ambitions, but he won't show it."
What is this great ambition?
What other ambition could a royal family member have?
It is to become king.
Please watch your words.
It could be interpreted as him plotting treason.
"It will be treason if he fails, but if he succeeds he will gain the world."
I will do anything if I can put a king on the throne.
You haven't gained your calm yet.
Your sword seemed to be thirsty for blood.
Our plan will fail if you act in haste.
Go to Chunghae at daybreak.
"Yes, sir."
Go to Chunghae?
Jang Bogo's men are guarding every inch of Chunghae.
It is impossible to penetrate into Chunghae.
I have a plan.
Do not worry.
Who are you?
We're pirates from Manwol Island.
We heard that Grand Chief Jang Bogo would spare our lives if we surrendered.
I need to go to Yangzhou.
Why?
I want to bring potters from Yangzhou.
"Kangjin, which is not far from Chunghae, has great soil for pottery making."
I will bring pottery makers and build a kiln.
We need to create jobs for the pirates who surrendered.
"If you open a pottery workshop, I will train them to be potters."
- Grand Chief.
- What is it?
The Manwol pirates have surrendered.
One way or another.
80 miles Northwest of nome... this is all Gonna be easy today.
Let's just get it over there And start making some money.
"Despite being knocked down Repeatedly this season,"
The kellys are off the mat...
- we made it.
- But now their dredge.
Is positioned on the banks Of the kougarok river.
"Gold is really what We're supposed to be making,"
And I'm not making a huge Amount Of gold for my family.
Thanks for Flying the colors.
The flag's up.
Everything's going good.
"I don't have the opportunity To get big gold,"
Not until we increase Our reputation in this town.
Hey-ho!
We got to show we can go Anywhere we need to.
And we're willing to do Anything we need to.
And that we're not Gonna give up.
- You ready?
- Go.
"There it goes, Don't stop, pull!"
"Okay, just calm down, Calm down."
I don't have Rubber boots on.
"Well, neither do I."
"Washed down from Volcanic mountaintops,"

"- Okay, get the boat set up."
- Get the hose out.
"This is how it works, okay?"
"I tell you what to do, You do it."
"Well, listen, I've loved all your stories but we have to come up with a title for our show."
"I quite liked, ""I'm not a happy slapper""."
That made me laugh.
"There's something about the spots in front of you, are they there now?"
"Yeah, cos there's a lot of bright light here, so they're dancing about."
When you go outside will they go away?
"Yeah, in the dark, I probably won't see 'em."
What about the Grandmaster Flash story?
There must be something in there.
What did he say to you?
What was the swear bit?
"""Why aren't you dancing, motherfucker?"""
"""We're going to do this to another white guy, in Exeter""."
In Exeter.
What about Alan Davies
"- Why Aren't You Dancing, Motherfucker?"
Alan Davies Is Now In Slovakia?
"What do you think, Ardal?"
May I take a bath in your home?
Can you remember how you actually phrased it when you asked for the bath?
"It was just literally, ""Hello, can I have a bath?"""
I wouldn't have done that if...
You could have pointed a gun at my head and I wouldn't have done that.
"First of all, thank you to Rob Delaney, Ardal O'Hanlon,"
"Roisin Conaty and Elis James, thank you very much."

Miley you are an excellent student.
But you don't have any extra-curricular activities.
And here at Stanford we're looking for students with a skosh more.
But come on you have to let me in.
This is the only college I applied to.
This is the only school you applied to?
You know on one hand that could sound incredibly dumb.
But on the other hand it could be a display of admirable school spirit.
Doesn't show up on a test but honey at the pep rally.
I will skosh you up one side and down the other.
Go Stanford!
Whoo-hoo!
Huh-uh!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey!

Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Alfredo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy,"
"and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
"""You're selfish."
"You only think of yourself."""
"""I've got it!"""
"""It could be dangerous."
"I still haven't tested it on humans."""
"""Do you still think I'm selfish?"""
"""It's done wonders for you!"""
"""Don't worry, my love!"""
"""I'll find the antidote!"""
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Alfredo was shrinking daily."
"""I'll always love you."""
"To stop her suffering, Alfredo left."
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
"But the chief - the one with the white hat, not the ones with the yellow hats - the one with the white hat came over to me and said,"
"""Did you stop the traffic?"""
"And I said, ""I thought I ought to,"
"""because I was worried it was going to explode."""
"And he said, ""No, that was a really heroic thing to do."
"Well done."""
"So, I go, ""Yeah, well, you know."" LAUGHTER"
"""Who WAS that man?"""
And um...
"So, I go home and Jane said, ""What did he say?"""
"I said, ""Oh, you know, he called me a hero - fairly standard..."
"""It wasn't..."
Doesn't really matter.
"""We'll forget about it."
"The less said, the better."""
"But, yeah, he said that was an amazing thing to have done, and, um...he said that he wished he could be like me."
But I gotta get back in the game.
So...
I'm gonna have to borrow your trust fund.
Wait.
You came all the way here to ask me for my money?
"Well, that money is mine."
"See, I gave it to you, so I can take it back."
"Actually, legally, it's my money, which means I get to decide what happens to it."
"Look, it's just gonna be temporary."
All right?
Just to get the blood-sucking bankers off my back.
And what have they ever created?
"They're just living off of guys like me, and now they won't give me what I need to make it back."
Maybe they're worried you'll lose it again.
"What, you think this is easy for me... come here looking for help?"
It's not.
"Look, both your brother and sister have entered the best universities."
"Kaan, if you tried a bit harder, you could succeed too."
He's got no discipline.
How was life in Germany?
It was like a ticking clock.
You grew up there too but this rascal isn't like that.
"Once he lifts his head away from the books, he instantly thinks of his guitar."
I can't control you all the time.
You have to want it yourself.
"I agree dad, you are absolutely right."
I feel ashamed instead of you.
It's such a shame!
Is this behavior suitable for you?
Don't you want to attent to university.
Of course There are many universities I can be registered at with my scores.
What do you mean?
How are you going to get into the Faculty of Medicine?
Stop pushing him.
"Maybe, he would like to study something else."
Is that so?
Don't you remember fantasizing when you were a kid?
You kept on saying you'd become a doctor like Aunt Nesrin's cousin.
"- Who's Aunt Nesrin's cousin, mom?"
- Don't you know?
What was it?
Mesut.
"Yeah, Mesut."
He graduated from medicine.
"Dad, he didn't finish medical school."
The school finished him.
Don't you remember him looking like this every time he came to us?
"Now, he's calling him an ox."
I may have caused.
I really didn't come off professional
Or right the first time we met and i'm very sorry.
Michelle and i have had a long conversation about this
And we've got things straight between us.
We are a couple
And now i think it's time that you two get things straight.
Michelle is here to offer you your job back.
"Yes, regina, you can have your job back if you want it."
"- I mean, you two have worked so hard..."
- Regina: no no no no no.
Let's get this straight...
I have worked very hard.
"Oh, regina, right now the power"
Of life and death is in that tongue of yours.
Now don't choose death again.
"Choose life, dummy."
"I got this, mama."
Could we have just a minute?
- We'll be right back.
- Certainly.
"Regina, we're in a recession"
And your bank account is depleted to the point that it's inside out.
"Now if you won't listen to a bible verse,"
Will you please at least listen to a famous movie one?
"""Stupid is as stupid does,"""
And right now you're behaving very stupid.
Now get over there and get your job back
And save this house.
- Michelle.
- Michelle: yes?
Can i think about this?
[Siren chirping] It's Trevor Nigel.
What...
You're gonna have to move that.
"Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest."
Excuse me?
We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.
Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.
I admit nothing.
Neither did your partner before he was killed.
Jordan is dead?
"He gave me up, didn't he?"
I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.
"No, Trevor."
You gave yourself up.
"Back when your studio was doing Heatwave,"
I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.
But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid.
"I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting."
Hayley:
It's the same handwriting on your serial killer partner's screenplay.
"Richard, you're a pretty good writer, but you should really read Jordan's work, because it is inspiring."
"After I read his ""Gemini Killers"" screenplay,"
I knew that I had found a kindred spirit...
Someone with the same desires as I had.
And his script laid out...
[Handcuffs clicks] the perfect plan for us to kill...
Ow!
...
Without attracting suspicion.
"Sadly, he could never nail the end."
"Well, we did, and you've reached it."
Maybe you should do the rewrite.
Goose bumps.
Strong pleasure.
The girls are not crazy.
The girls are just excited.
"Oh, my God!"
he One Direction boys are causing hysteria  everywhere.
It's akin to BeatIemania.
So a small group of British girls became a huge group  of British girls who then turned Europe into huge fans.
America then stepped in.
So in the space of months the fans got the entire planet  to support One Direction.
You sing!
Let me hear you up top!
Pandemonium.
So the whole world are fans of One Direction.
And we haven't put a record out yet.
"And then  we released ""What Makes You beautiful."""
"First thought was, "" could this work in America?"""
here's not much of a track record  of any British boy bands breaking in America.
"But once everybody heard ""hat Mak es You Beautiful""  it was a perfect storm."
Stateside  these boys are making history.
hey've gone straight to the number one spot.
his week's number one.
Best British single.
It's One Direction.
Lik e it just  took itself off and took our career off too.
It just went:
hank you so much.
Yes they're all good-looking guys.
"Yes, they can all sing really well."
But combine that  with the style  of music they were making  which was rock-influenced so they had lik e a little edge to it.
One Direction sound....
There's a little hint of something dangerous.
I don't know.
I don't know.
They're probably not gonna pick me.
"Don't give up hope, Riley."
You never know.
"Hey, what's Connor doin'?"
Connor.
What's goin' on?
"Everything's fine, I'm just gonna go around to the back."
"Hey, player, I have one for you."
"So, a cop shows up to a crime scene, and a citizen shows up and says, officer, officer, quick, there is a hundred minorities and a plumber that really need your help, and um..."
"And the cop says, oh no, we should help the plumber, and the citizen says, see, cops never care about the minorities."
"Wait, is that right?"
Okay.
"A citizen runs up to a cop and says a hundred minorities and a plumber need your help, the cop says, why the plumber?"
"Then the citizen says, see, the cops never ask about the minorities."
Damn it.
"He just forgot all the important parts, right."
"Fucking cops hate minorities, man."
"Dude, I got pulled over for tinted windows once."
Hate the po po.
I'm in hell.
What are you doing?
Just being safe.
There's no one in the house.
You sure about that?
"I mean, you never know."
"No, our whole job depends on being sure."
You should always know.
How long did you monitor the owner's pattern?
"I know the plans say he won't be back for a few weeks, but how long did you monitor his routine?"
"Like, two-"
Dodo and Wakizaka continue to clash?
"Internal division is the greatest enemy, Your Eminence."
Reasonable amount of rivalry can so increase productivity.
But the fact that there is Konishi behind Dodo and Kato behind Wakizaka is what bothers me.
"If I keep them together, they will be more concerned with fight for power than fight against Chosun."
How about changing the lineup of the advance guards?
That's what we will do.
Send Wkizaka with Konishi.
Konishi thinks too much.
He needs a decisive comrade to push him.
"And for the same reason, we will pair Dodo with Kato."
High Commander...
His Majesty has acknowledged your loyalty.
Sir!
Weigh it.
Hurry up!
We don't need to!
It's much lighter!
Be quiet.
From now on we're going to look a hundred times before we leap.
As we should!
Is that good?
"That's good, isn't it?"
I think it's light enough that we won't have any problem with the force of restoration.
Yes!
"What's wrong, Lieutenant?"
I though you'd jump for joy.
"If we use copper and iron alloy, our problem will be solved."
Right?
Then our problem is solved!
What's wrong?
Copper is many times more expensive than iron.
I'm Dave.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
How are you doing?
This is where we normally jam at.
Everybody know to come here when you guys start singing?
"Oh, yeah."
My grandfather was one of the ones who introduced the drums to the church.
That's right.
"You know, Ben told me about that."
"It's an honorable, respectable family tradition, so much that you have it passed down from generation to generation."
It just brings so much joy to all of us when we can just come together and be able to just play together.
I don't know if every city considers music to be that important.
"And as a musician, I mean, that's the holy land."
Right now the storm is 225 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.
We had a little gazebo in front of the house.
"Thank you, Killelea."
We will let your teacher know.
What do we think?
Mr Chandler?
Not quite up to it.
Mr Kirkby?
Button off.
He had a button off his jacket.
Slippery slope.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
Hey.
"There's auditions in here, hop it."
"No, I've come for the auditions."
"Well, they're over."
"Again I say unto thee, hop it."
- Has anybody else seen them?
Only Selena.
She thinks I'm a genius.
What do you think?
Are they good enough to send to a magazine?
"Yes, if you want to end up in prison."
Those stories were full of enough libel and slander and double-entendre to hang us all.
"Allison, is that how Peyton Place really looks to you?"
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.
Those stories were a good start.
"Now, where do you go from here?"
That's what I hoped to find out from you.
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...
"Thank you, but I don't want to go to college."
I never have.
Why not?
Because I don't want to study about writing.
I want to write.
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare was a wonderful writer or that wonderful books have already been written.
Those books tell you how and why.
I'd rather find that out myself at a typewriter.
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.
"All right if that's how you feel about it, then let's do it."
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.
"Who said I was a cynical, hard-hearted newspaperman?"
- Okay.
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah.
"- You know, sometimes, if you just press on the temple--"
"You have a headache, don't you?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
"- Look, 'cause, like, your whole face is full of strawberries."
"You're sensitive, aren't you?"
Redheads are sensitive.
"- Yeah, I guess so."
- When's your birthday?
Are you a Virgo?
- Yeah.
"- I knew it, I knew it, see."
"I do just a little bit of palm reading and can do horoscopes, charts."
This woman taught me.
- Who taught you?
"- Yeah, she was a pill-popping, you know, astrologer, but she taught me how to read charts."
"It's fascinating, so I'm really good--"
Iâm really good with people.
I'm really great with strangers.
- So where did you work besides Chicago and Greece?
"- Oh, gosh, I worked in Vancouver for a while at this place called the Golfin' Dolphin, but they didn't have alcohol, but I served drinks, but it was just, like, you know,"
"water mixed with, like, flavored juice."
"I didn't work there long, but that was in Vancouver and that was a lot of fun."
"And then I worked in Iowa for a while and then Washington, D.C."
and then I worked in
"South Carolina, Charleston."
- Where are you from?
"- Are you-- Originally, Iâm from North Carolina."
"Raleigh, the capital."
You been there?
Well honey nothing stays the same forever.
It's kind of like a mullet.
A thing of beauty in its day.
But I tell you what sooner or later even the party in the back has to end.
Are you telling me that I need to give up Hannah Montana?
No.
I could never do that.
Neither could Jesse or Lilly.
The only one that could ever answer that would have to be you.
Please don't say listen to my heart.
-Darling it's just...
-Or my kidney or my spleen.
Or any other vital organs.
Then what do you want me to tell you?
I want you to tell me that...
"If I give up Hannah, everything will be okay."
But I can't do that.
What I can tell you is you'll be able to go to that school with Lilly.
You'll be able to go out with Jesse without half the world hating him.
You will have to give up your privacy.
No matter where you go peoples are gonna recognize you.
And they're gonna treat you different.
Is it worth it?
Only you can decide that.
[Door closes]
"[""I'll Always Remember You"" playing]"
I always knew this day would come.
We'd be standing one by one.
With our future in our hands.
"So many dreams, so many plans."
I always knew after all these years.
"There'd be laughter, there'd be tears."
"You are such a miser man,"
Calvin Kline didn't made underwear like this.
"Don't speak in public, This man... gave me electric shocks."
If electricity gone then hits me on inverter.
"You don't cry, you just ask him."
Tell him about Sunday.
This Sunday or last Sunday?
"Shut up you question answer, speak straight, Pinto!"
"Don't be angry, You don't interfere, Batla Bhai!"
You're like my younger son.
"That's why I am telling you, Who killed your Hira Lal?"
"We killed him, Now that Hira Lal... where he's gone to hide that diamond?"
How do I know?
"You tell me,"
"You must know little little, Your memory has gone week,"
"Which Diamond, which car, she was that car."
Papa!
These two are the same.
"Speak, Where is the diamond?"
"I don't know, very good Chandu, don't tell them, no matter what you lost your life, but don't tell them."
Chandu!
Where is the diamond?
"Stupid, what are you doing, tell them it's in the petrol tank,"
In petrol tank?
"Diamond is mine, diamond is mine."
I bought the car then diamond is mine.
"I came here to buy car, diamond is mine, I have a Gun."
"So diamond is mine, Papa."
"But petrol tank is not opening, Then how could we get the diamond?"
"Ok, all you people turn it down,"
What are you doing?
Vomit!
What Musa and I have struggled for is worth more than any one single person.
It's about our species' survival.
We've all had to make sacrifices.
"Now tell me, I was yours."
"The bond between Hunters is different, deeper than humans."
"We're not just family, we're inside each other, it's how we're made."
Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Like a part of me was ripped from my flesh.
"And I never forgot it, Allison, never."
Not one day has gone past when I haven't thought of you.
You... are a part of me.
And I love you.
"I love you, too."
That hollow in your back is sacred.
That's where we carry our young in their native form.
You defiled it because you despise yourself.
I blame your father for that.
"Ted ruined you, Allison, and yet I'm the one you hate."
You were born a Hunter!
You know how you came to look like you do?
"I chose this body for you, a vehicle to keep you safe and strong."
You killed someone for their body?
For you!
I chose well.
- I was a child.
A baby!
- That baby would have died anyway.
"Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum."
I did it a favor and I did it for you!
Stop!
No!
There's water in the tap.
"You know, your old man, he loved them horses."
He absolutely loved them and you know that.
What is wrong with you?
Right now he's flipped around in that grave of his.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, boy."
"Matt, I think something that we can actually agree on is that we need to keep these horses healthy."
Because it's part of your deal as a permit holder.
- Correct.
- So it is in your best interest to make sure the horses are in good shape.
What're you saying?
"I'm just saying that maybe Ty, with his vet experience, should monitor the horses' condition while they're in your care, and I can help."
No.
They don't need to be monitored.
They're fine.
You don't know that.
"They're wild, right?"
So they could have any number of diseases.
Diseases that could spread to other stock.
To healthy stock.
"Come on, Matt."
What're you afraid of?
- Yeah!
- Let 'em check out the horses.
Fine.
Monitor the horses.
"But that's it, you hear me?"
"She said she loved me, Jeffie, and... she said I was just like my mom and she gave me all these pictures and stuff and..."
Okay.
"Well, can I call you once you're done work?"
Okay.
I'll let you know what it happens.
Okay.
Why?
How are you here?
Why did you come here?
Miyu
Stop all this and come home
I don't want to
Why are you here?
Miyu
Excuse me
If you cause any trouble I will have to call the police
Is that Ok?
Did you call her Bebi?
"No, I didn't"
"Um, sorry, there are security cameras on each floor"
"Um, so would it be Ok If I report this to the police?"
Give us a second.
We are friends
Bebi!
Come out and explain
Bebi!
"Wait, wait a sec"
My lust was just...
Shut up
You pathetic loser!
Only with professional fucking experience
The only way you'd lose your virginity is by putting your dick in your own ass
That's so mean
Please stop making so much trouble
Our business suffers from people like you
Sorry
"I won't contact the police this time, as you say these are your friends"
"But next time, I will have to call the police"
She's got more confidence in me than I have in my...
"Larry, you stopped and spoke to her?"
We chatted a while.
You chatted a while.
Yes.
"Larry, I resign from the Waterhouse account."
You...
You resign?
What are you talking about?
I will not accept any job that my wife got for me.
You got this job because you're the best man for it.
That's not the point.
Any success I make I'm going to make on my own or not at all.
Samantha.
"Now, you listen to me."
I have had it with your magic and spells.
Now be quiet.
I'm not finished yet.
"I've had it up to here with all your witchcraft turning me into a werewolf, into a chimpanzee!"
"I'm not through yet, Sam."
"Just to prove that I have had it, I am going to blow this account."
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna blow the account!
What do you think of that?
Is this 555-7328?
"Look, I'll have to make this fast."
Mr. Waterhouse is outside.
"Before you meet him, I want to brief you..."
- I don't need any briefing.
"- Darrin, Waterhouse is a very conservative man."
He's been making thumbtacks since 1888 and he doesn't go for this modern hoopla.
I don't know why he decided to change agencies and come with us but take a tip from me and play it sincere and conservative.
Aka award magnet.
You know I can't compete with death.
"Oh, it's my son."
He's driving back to college from L.A.
And I begged him to stop here on the way.
So he's gonna be here this afternoon.
"Well, how's he doing?"
"You know, I don't know."
He rarely speaks to me.
I get the occasional grunt on mother's day.
"Oh, kids can be so ungrateful."
"I mean, you get them the best nannies money can buy... and then they blackmail you with threats... to write a mommie dearest."
"Oh, look who's back from Hollywood."
What was it like doing Brad pitt's eyebrows?
Does he smell like fresh cream... on a fine spring morning?
'Cause that's how I imagine it.
"Elka, celebrities are just like everyone else."
You take that back.
"Oh, I'm just starting to wonder... if there isn't more to life... than removing celebrities' unwanted hair."
I think I'm having a mid-life crisis.
Mid-life?
"You know, if you really are having a crisis, maybe you should see a therapist."
The only therapy I need is liquid therapy.
Hello.
Victoria got another emmy nomination.
Congratulations.
She can't win.
She's up against a dead girl.
"You didn't have Susan Lucci killed, did you?"
No.
That was just trash talk. the oddest thing just happened.
My Agent says that there's this huge Internet rumor... that I'm dying from some disease called...
"Is it alright then, Jon?"
Well done Catrin.
"When there's raid, I want you to go down the tube station."
I didn't bring you all the way from Wales to see you get hit by a bomb.
I saw April today.
She and Tony have made up ever such clear code.
So you can write to him about what she's doing.
'The Veg green' that means England. 'Onion Soup' is France.
There's a word for regiment and one for troop...
Oh....
"Do you really have to smoke that thing, Ambrose?"
Wouldn't you just mind?
I can mind smoking.
I can't mind smoke.
That's a cut.
I wonder would it be possible to have something to do?
My hands are aching for something to do.
And it seems alright for the character.
"Perhaps, try to find some knitting?"
Water or word.
"I fully understand the national importance of what we are shooting, and obviously, there's no question of diluting the message."
I just...
I wonder if it might impact a little more punch if Mr.Brown would express a little more.
"For example, the mention of the clever code, I might say, ""Well, that will be the first clever thing, April has ever done in her life"""
Did you...do you see?
Just a...just a dash of...of humor and then follow it on.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh!
Certainly.
Oh!
No.
I gave my daughter.
My mother told me that was the worst mistake I ever made.
Is a terrible thing what he said.
If I were your mother
I would be very proud of you.
"Alice, long time was a lost soul."
I did not know who he was.
"One night a drunk date party and went into a dark room, and I let a stranger me cogiera until disappeared."
"There were no names or faces, only touch."
"Sometimes when you're lost, when you're totally lost,"
It is when you you find yourself.

"Plumber, IT consultant, Mrs. cleaning, accountant ..."
Dolly in part front and in the middle.
"""Queen of the swingers"" or something like that."
The final at the hotel is the icing on the cake.
You go there as a couple and takes all photos.
"Orgies, ugly, sex anal ... all those weird."
Do not.
"What do you mean ""no""?"
Much time and money
She has been invested in this.
We're about to print.
"If I do this, I will my way by myself."
"Alice, could talk at least?"
Where are you going now?
I have to finish my story.
"You like stories, right?"
"What's what you want from me, Alice?"
It's very simple.
Are we going to stay together and grow old despite all this shit or not?
"Because if not, then we are losing time."
We'II wait till she's through soaking in the hot tub then I'm gonna inquire if she's acquainted with the napoleonic Code.
"Oh, stanley, don't be so silly."
It looks to me like you been swindled.
"And when you get swindled under NapoIeonic Code, I get swindled too."
I don't like to get swindled.
"Oh, stanley you've no idea how ridiculous you're being when you suggest that my sister  or I or anyone else of our family could have perpetrated a swindle on anyone."
"Oh, come on, now."
Where's the money if the place was sold?
Not sold.
Lost!
-Lost.
-Come here.
-stanley.
-will you just open your eyes to this stuff?
"-What, she got this out of teacher's pay?"
"-Oh, hush."
will you look at these fine feathers and furs that she comes to preen herself in here?
What is this article?
"That's a soIid-goId dress, I believe."
"-Oh, honest."
-This one here.
"What is that, a fox piece?"
-stanley!
-A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.
Where are your fox pieces?
"This is bushy snow-white ones, no less."
Where are your white fox furs?
Those are inexpensive summer furs that blanche has had a Iong time.
I have an acquaintance who deals in this sort of merchandise.
-He's coming to make an appraisal.
"-Don't be such an idiot, stanley."
"Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's a thousand dollars invested in this stuff."
"Hey Pakodi, Tiger Bhai has come."
Take Chilly Chicken and chilled beer.
['Sher'ishindiwordmeaning'Tiger']
"Yes, Tiger Bhai and Beer Bhai will come."
That Tiger Bhai will not come at all.
"It is Tiger Bhai, who came."
Why did you say Tiger Bhai then?
What do you say 'Tiger' in English?
- Tiger!
Have I served him for a year without knowing that?
What ?
Should I newly tell you the order?
"I should tell you a new matter, you are under arrest."
"Without knowing that you were Tiger Bhai, I fed the militants who crossed the border for a year."

"Though I have no success, I did 16 undercover operations."
I was side tracked as bad luck is in my back pocket.
I will get into main track now by pushing you in.
"If you are undercover, all these are my cover."
We are the undercover to cover you sir.
Undercover for the undercover?
Excellent!
Do not underestimate diamond as it's light and department guy as he is short.
Thank you guys.
I am very happy about my first success.
This is your last mission.
This is the last job I will be giving you.
"That means, are you dying sir?"
"- Suzuki sir, last mission for you"
"That means, am I going to die sir?"
- You will be retiring next month.
My God!
Because he wants to build up something new for the child.
"I need to leave him something, he says."
"That's how he is, my husband..."
"Not such a one as yours, who does not want it."
"But he's bound to notice it sometime, Mrs John!"
Will he?
- Yes!
"Only you and Bruno know about this, and he keeps his mouth shut."
My husband doesn't need to find out that that is not his child... nor mine... when I lay it in the cradle for him.
Mine?
"No, Mrs John, that's out of the question."
"But yes, it can be done."
"It will work out, it will..."
I've closely considered everything...
"I've read the books from the state library on childbirth, and I've sent you to the doctor to see that all is fine."
I've made good friends with the midwife.
"But Pauline, what could happen?"
"If one is so young, fit and healthy as you, one doesn't need to lose it like I did."
"No, Mrs John."
No can do!
But Pauline...
Both of you are helped by this.
Yourself and your Harald!
"When he asks you where the child is, you say that you've lost it, like what happened to me..."
But he won't ask anything.
"He doesn't want it, and neither do you."
You want HIM!
And without a kid he may take you back!
That's why he left.
Or do you want to go back?
"No, I don't want to go back."
"Isn't it true that you don't want the child, or did you never say so?"
Yes.
A reminder that shakpeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this,doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."
But my first impression is that we're dealing with a complete loon.
"That masters in psych is starting to pay off,ducky."
merciful god in heaven.
"I have seen a loof things selling real estate, but can you imagine walking in,seeing that?"
When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpse in the living room,if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real este women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
- Who's the owner?
- A local contractor... and me.
"Uh,I buy and bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert whitehead,the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here,you or bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body,that's a real plus."
Jody.
I came as fast as I could.
She'll go sailing proudly down the years in the epic of dunkirk.
"And our great grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war-- by snatching glory out of defeat and then swept on to victory, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious."
Man:
"I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh, shall I see God."
"And I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold..."
I've got a son the same age.
"Aelwyn, the roman soldiers..."
They're coming?
Up the plain.
Hundreds.
Then today will be a good day to die.
What about the astronomicons?
We must remove them to the sanctuary.
Gather our brothers.
Go.

My blood is on your hands.
Murderer.
Murderer.
Murderer!
Murderer!

-There are only three small onions.
-Three onions?
How many tomatoes?
-Two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.
Johnny Dio did the meat.
"We had no broiler, so he did everything in pans."
It smelled up the joint something awful and the hacks used to die but he cooked a great steak.
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.
Medium rare.
An aristocrat.
When you think of prison you get pictures in your mind of all those old movies with rows and rows of guys behind bars.
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.
"It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy, who was doing his time in Atlanta."
Give me two steaks.
"Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, all mixed together, living like pigs."
But we lived alone.
We owned the joint.
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
They deserved it.
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe wouldn't rat on the guys that we did.
People used to be able to leave their doors open.
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.
-We'll have to do something about that bastard.
-l took care of him.
What'd you bring?
Some bread.
"Vinny, I got your peppers and onions."
"Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese."
..against him then too I wont believe it.
How did you believe it?
Who is the fool who believes that Krishna has stolen anything?
Then.. then why did you do this?
"Its very simple, Janki."
Try and understand.
I can tolerate anything but when someone..
..tells Krishna anything it pierces in me like an arrow .
Today that arrow pierced my heart when..
..those people called him a thief.
I have controlled my injured hurt with great difficulty.
I have raised this hand with great difficulty to hit him.
I told him to get out of this house with great difficulty.
But.. butjust think..
where will he go?
"The world is very big, Janki."
He can go anywhere.
And.. after a few bumps he will also learn to get steady.
"No, I wont let him drift like that."
"No Janki, you still dont know my brothers."
You didnt think that after I die..
- No.
Dont say that.
"-Yes, Janki."
You didnt think what they will do..
..to that poorthing after I die.
He.. he cant stay in this house and understand that..
..because he has a clean heart.
But why send him like this even if we want to?
"He wont understand any otherway, Janki."
And he will never be able to leave us and go.
Sir.. bless me with the hands you beat me.
- How?
- Go back to the wreck for some cable.
- You can't go back up there.
- I'll just have to.
Just sit here and shut up.
Can you do that?
- It'll be dark soon.
- You afraid of the dark?
I was thinking of you coming back down.
"Hey, kid..."
I'm sorry.
I'll get you down in the morning.
- Did it look like an airplane?
- Can't say for sure.
- What can you say for sure?
- It was a flash out the corner of my eye.
"It might have been wings, it might have been a couple of trees."
Could you have gone back to make sure?
It's pretty hard to tell one ridge from the other.
"Besides, I was running low on gas and worried about getting back myself."
- Show me on the map.
"- Well, that was the other problem."
My compass was messing up on me.
I didn't know where I was.
"Not until I saw the rail line running into Baker, somewhere around here."
You let your pilots fly without knowing where they are?
The wind blew me down there.
You can't always tell what the wind's going to do.
You're talking about hundreds of square miles - and suppose you were wrong?
You'd be responsible for sending everybody in the wrong direction.
You were right to report the sighting.
But you see the problems it caused.
But I'm the one who processed it like this.
It's always interesting to process other people's photographs.
What about this part?
Did you cover part of the negative?
"No I didn't, the negative ends somewhere here."
"Here I didn't expose it, and here I used a light pencil."
Do you recognize me?
Is this a person?
A painting?
"It's not a painting, it's a real man."
"He wasn't naked, even though the picture suggests otherwise."
"He's perfect like this, isn't he?"
"Yes, yes."
"Is this picture called ""vertigo""?"
"Yes well, it's called like this for anecdotic reasons."
Because I saw the film after...
"I took the picture, well it was the same afternoon but.."
"It isn't very related, even though I was..."
I suffered from vertigo while taking it.
I was quite drunk.
This bottle is almost empty.
It's a very strange story.
The story of the shooting of the picture is quite special.
Would you mind telling me?
It's quite obscene.
I was...
In a position...
An embarassing situation with a friend.
Who...
"I lit a cigarette, and he told me..."
"""You're lighting a cigarette now, like an Amsterdam whore..."""
"And I say ""Yes, why not?"""
"- Yes, but not to throw suspicion on him."
The girl was abused and killed and thrown in the harbour.
"If justice is all the perp wants in exchange for Emilie, let's provide it."
- Or what?
- She's right.
We have no leads on Emilie.
And we can't afford to adopt the refined manners of Special Branch.
"I gave him my word, and I believe he'll give us Emilie."
- But we must move now.
"- Yes, indeed."
"You will search the harbour, and Borch will assemble a team."
"No, no, we'll take care of that."
You can take the damned harbour.
"Well, now we seem to be cooperating again."
"He could have been in Copenhagen harbour two hours before he stole the car,"
- and he had plenty of time to hide Emilie.
- Search everything again.
There must be a witness or a camera.
Someone must have seen something.
"We 're trying, but Zeuthen's people are everywhere."
We're surrounded by security guards.
- Brix is trying to change that.
"- OK, what about Borch?"
Are you two OK?
"I know he's the one who fucked up, but he got us back on track when we thought the girl was dead."
"Call me if something turns up, Asbjorn."
It can't come as a surprise that there are things I couldn't tell you.
- Don'!
be like that.
I've been loyal.
"- It's coincidental, I know."
"It meant something to me, what happened over there."
"But, Daaga..."
- It's quite simple.
"Ifyou keep an eye on Vijay Varma, and find out details about  people he meets, then it is possible to identify his informer."
Did you read the news about your friend?
He risked his life in a dangerous chase and seized 8 millions in gold.
This kind of daredevily is his forte.
My friend is a incredible police officer!
He is an incredible police officer.
And you are a remarkable lawyer.
The only difference is that he catches criminals... and I free them.
Doesn't any misunderstanding arise bemeen you mo friends on this regard?
-No way.
No chance.
We don't mix our friendship with our profession.
I can give my life for him.
"Ifyou mo are such friends, please include me in your list too."
Who doesn't need a good friend?
"Madam, I have written your name in my list at first sight."
I must entertain you well.
How about one more coffee?
"No, thanks."
I must say something.
Our friendship seems to be a one way traffic.
ARer that pam I have come a dozen times over to your house.
But you haven't set your foot in my humble home.
Not even once.
There's nothing as such.
Someday I will certainly set my foot at your celestial abode.
Thank you vey much!
I want to speak to Mr Vijay.
Speaking.

It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me.
One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.
Were you?
I was carrying this.
"I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond."
"I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down."
"There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home."
"A few months later, my mother shakes me awake in the middle of the night."
"She says, ""You've got five minutes to grab anything you ever want to see again."""
"At the time, I thought to myself this is the moment where my life changes for the worse."
So one of the things I grabbed on my way out is this little stone.
"Look, Pete, this is a touching story."
Are you going to tell me what this is?
Uraninite.
As in uranium.
"Oh, uranium."
In Connecticut?
We're one of the few states that's got it.
"After I analyzed Pete's stone,"
I had him take me out to the pond.
- Took some core samples.
- How much is down there?
It doesn't matter.
"Just from the surface readings alone, it promises that some big energy company will come in and buy us out."
Okay.
And how much do I get for not telling Audrey?
We can give you 2.
2 what?
2 million.
How much are you getting?
We're getting our share.
Your share is $2 million.
"Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"
"I did it all with my trusty flute and... oh, never mind."
You wouldn't believe it anyway.
Let's get moving.
You run into the portal.
I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.
"No, you're too hurt."
You need a healer.
"Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my fight now.
Korra.
I love you.
"I love you too, dad."
Yipyip.
"Once we're inside, you go find Jinora."
"Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape."
Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.
"So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you."
Are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?
"If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after harmonic convergence."
If not...
Let's go.
"Tenzin, go find Jinora."
Come on!
"You're running out of time, Raava."
I know you feel it coming.
You guys.
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady, and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
Dale Roach.
He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.
The things they did to us at Sands View.
I promise you I will get these bastards.
"If Bains killed Danny,"
I'd lay you evens he killed Kennedy as well.
You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.
"(Cockney accent) lf you want a way out, you'll listen to me."
Did he ever mention any other names?
"Politicians, coppers?"
Single-handedly brings in an APO...
"Welcome back, Dot."
(Phones ringing)
"BENTON""."
I'd just like to get on with my life.
"Ms Denton, I'm Gill Biggeloe, Legal Counsel to AC-l 2."
Mm.
I imagine they keep you very busy.
Ha.
Have a seat.
You know Superintendent Hastings.
I do.
"As pan of a new initiative christened Truth and Reconciliation, following a miscarriage of justice, parties are invited to engage in dialogue to initiate the healing process."
There seems to be an oversight.
Some of the officers involved in my wrongful conviction are missing.
"Superintendent Hastings, as Senior Investigating Officer, represents the whole team."
"Well, I want them here."
"Or this new box you need to tick just... well, won't get ticked."
God give me strength.
Thank you.
It wouldn't have been the same without you.
"Ms Denton, on behalf of this department and this constabulary,"
Will it be okay if it comes from me?
It's not like I have to like you with an effort now.
I've always liked you.
But I never felt that you could be the one for me.
"But now that I think of it, it all makes sense."
"I like you, Sadhana."
Really?
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
A small word said in passing
"It is chilly, it is true, listen"
You added sweetness to what you spoke
My masculinity is stunned.
Should I say slowly
Or increase the speed?
Should I leave after saying or pause right there?
Should I pinch at the love that was said
Or should I lose myself to the love that was grabbed by my hands
I realize today that there may be a thousand changes to the sight.
I see myself through your eyes conveying love.
I am seeing you with a pouring love... that I have collected.
I am gently bringing to your ears the words I collected slowly.
I put my hands out to get a raindrop...
It remained just as a drizzle.
What do you think you're doing?
- My office!
Now!
"Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal."
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence?
Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.
I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
Tris!
Tris!
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
"I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave."
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
- I will not be a party to violence.
- No-one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
"- One, what?"
- One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive others and yourself."
You're hurting Tris.
And my heart goes out to you.
I know what it's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love.
All that stuff we put on the table just now?
"Let's talk about it later, okay?"
"Right, yeah."
That's probably a good idea.
When the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble.
I'm gonna call Kirsten and Sandy.
Where's my jacket?
Gross.
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the apocalypse or whatever."
Got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods.
A space heater.
-And an extra pair of....
-I'm not--
"Hey, couldn't get reception in here."
I'm gonna step out in the hall.
Okay.
Okay.
"Yes, Orange County, as you've probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities."
"But power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
"As more information comes in, we 'll relay it to you."
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
"So we got our marching orders, or our staying-put orders."
So no one' s to leave the plaza unless they have to.
What are we gonna do with everyone?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
-What about looters?
-We just have to get organized.
"So keep the radio on, gather up anything you think might be useful."
I'm a celebrity chef.
That's my craft.
"I've cooked for Nathan Lane,"
Martha Stewart
"Martin Short, Don Rickles,"
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.
"Hot, hot, hot, hot."
And they've all loved my food.
Coming across.
"Coming across, hot."
"Oh, [bleep]."
Have you seen the trash anywhere?
Oh.
"I guess all I have to do is turn around, right?"
"They think I'll play that cute factor, you know?"
Let's put it this way.
Everybody is looking for you.
So leave or I'm calling the cops.
Leave.
"Hello, gentlemen."
How are you?
- Don't get too close or I'll vomit.
- You never used to say that.
"You see one of my men behind my back, you blackmail him, you appropriate my work."
You really are the height of elegance.
"Hello, everyone."
"Please, don't get up."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief."
"So, the Butcher of la Villette has been freed erroneously."
"Whatever the mistakes made in this case, it is now time to apply all the means possible to stop this psychopath before he kills again or leaves the country."
"The Crime Squad is officially in charge, but I wish for all squads to collaborate on the case and to forward all useful information to Superintendent Bremont."
"I beg you not to fight each other in a sterile war, but to bring your strength together to hunt this predator."

"They may not respect the man, but they must respect the office."
- All right.
"Listen up, folks."
- [Fingers Snapping]
"Last couple of weeks, we've all benefited from the stateside savvy... of a crackerjack corpsman..."
Sergeant Barney Hutchinson.
"However, due to matters beyond our control... the man is not getting the recognition he deserves."
So our very own Major Houlihan has come up with a brainstorm... thatjust might even the score.
- Major.
- Oh.
"Sergeant Hutchinson, front and center."
- Any news on Klinger?
"- No, but I've got a call in to the White House."
These are my old lieutenant's bars.
"For your remaining three weeks, you shall have the unofficial rank... of honorary first lieutenant."
- [Margaret] Lieutenant.
- [Chattering]
- Congratulations.
- [Hawkeye Laughing]
- [Charles] What the...
- [Man] Hey!
It's Corporal Godiva.
Good grief.
What is this disgusting spectacle?
"Oh, it's Klinger on Sophie, and they're both naked."
What in the name of George Armstrong Custer do you think you're doing?
This demonstration is intended to dramatize... that I am unfit to wear any uniform.
- I am incompetent.
I'm insubordinate.
- And indecent.
This is a protest.
"Not for any reason, I just..."
It's quite arty...
It's quite arty writing.
I wanted something different.
"I tried it in Chinese writing the other night, it looked very good."
Victoria was very impressed.
I copied it off of a Chinese menu.
"So I probably had ""fried rice"" and ""salt and pepper ribs"""
"and ""hot and sour soup"" on my arm, instead of ""Victoria""."
Aw.
He's adorable.
I don't understand.
Is that real?
Is that real?
"What do you mean, is that real?"
"I thought that was a Comic Relief spoof video, or something."
"No, that's a documentary he made back in 2000."
"Oh, my God."
"Also, he doesn't call them tattoos, he calls them arm pictures."
"Oh, my God!"
And he also had two weird square bowls with floating eggs in them.
"Yeah, he had two hard-boiled eggs in front of him."
Yeah.
In the water.
"Why, David?"
"You know those e-mails where he was asking for a effing knighthood, they were definitely doctored, because there's no way he could spell ""knighthood"", from watching that."
"It must be pretty hard, though, considering Sir Mix-A-Lot got one and he didn't."
"I don't think you should be angry about getting one, but I quite think I'd quite like to be a sir."
"I mean, I..."
Good luck with that.
"If anyone here is going to be a sir, it's going to be the king of daytime."
I bet the Queen watches Pointless.
I will beat you
- Look there
- My goodness
What are you looking through lens at the opposite house?
Do you know how good she plays the limp game?
"Poor girl, she is one legged and can limp only"
-One legged?
-Yeah
- Whom are you referring?
With two eyes I saw her playing with two legs!
- I too saw
- What happened to your family?
Your brothers rage if I talk about your dad
- You call a normal girl one legged
- One leg only
They have started Let us go and see
Whatever we see doesn't belong to our eyes!
Doesn't belong to our eyes!
Since you have become a pupil of my eyes...
You can't be separated from the eyes...
And you can't be separated from me
Oh God!
"Neelaveni, why did you stop?"
Dance until the pestle break
Dance until the mortar rolls Dance until the house get crumbled
Shut up your mouth
-It's really one leg
-I'll tell if it is one leg or two legs
What for?
...
Catch her
Catch
"Well, well, well, wonders will never cease."
Eddie Catflap's been thinking.
Put out some bunting.
Organise a street party.
Let off some fireworks.
Telephone the Queen.
Give everyone a week's holiday.
The man with no brain's been thinking.
Everybody go to the lavatory in amazement.
"You don't know how you wound, Richie, you really don't."
"However, no matter, because you will soon be in pris."
- Pris?
- Pris-on.
You have aided and abetted a robbery in front of Mr Forsyth and 50 mad checkout girls.
I am all right.
I was just the mysteriously handsome bloke in the huge trousers who vanished without a trace.
But you're Richie Rich.
And you'll be going to pris.
"You're not all right, darling, cos I shall squeal."
"Yeah, I shall sing and... and blab..."
Then I might even spill a little bit.
"And I shall buy a lighter sentence with the names of my accomplices - to wit, Edward Catflap."
Then I'll have a face-lift so you can't exact your revenge.
"You'd need a fork-lift truck to lift your face, matey."
"At least I've got a face, not a collage of bogeys and sick."
"Just cos you never get any girlfriends, you think you can take it out on me."
"Me, never get any girlfriends?"
"That's rich, you never get any girlfriends."
I was out with a girl last Wednesday.
"Eddie, that was your mother."
I still got a snog.
- Snog?

You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
AII of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
Some rituals used in the Black Mass.
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"Please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
That didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
"So, on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
"Most of them are Scalerians, you know."
- Utter rogues.
Corruption's a way of life.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"Can't fight worth a damn, either."
"It's a security problem, General."
It means that whatever's up there must be able to take information from databanks anywhere in the Federation.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
"What, you mean, troop movements, that sort of thing?"
"An open book, General."
Then put a stop to it at once.
"Yes, sir, well, if you would authorise a search and destroy mission..."
Absolutely.
"No, Commissioner, the video system's been destroyed."
"All right, Leitz."
- See nothing's touched and inform the General.
- I already have.
He's here.
Good.
Tell him I'll take charge of the investigation.
We need an arrest before Headquarters are told of Practor's death.
"Somebody wanted to make very sure of him, eh?"
"Commissioner Sleer said to touch nothing, sir."
- Sleer's taking charge?
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, it's a police job, I suppose."
- You searched the apartment?
"- Yes, General."
The computer must have let him in.
So the killer is somebody Practor knew.
I'd say that limits the field a bit.
"You aren't wrong, Sis."
I'm sorry about before.
It was no problem.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know why you got angry."
Did I say something wrong?
"Hibara-san, you are the only one that I can really talk to."
Please!
Let's be friends.
I am always surprised by your interest and knowledge about the other side.
It sometimes even makes me a litlle embarrassed.
"But, I don't think that people actually seeing that stuff can really be that positive."
"And, I really want to talk to you about different things, Saho-san."
"When you talk about ghosts and other things like that, Saho-san, it is like..."
Like...?
Enenra!
Eh?
No...
Um...
"It is like the more that you try to look to the other side, the more you get caught by a net of smoke, Saho-san."
"You can't see what is really around you, right?"
"But, if you can't see what is going on here, you will never be able to see what is happening on the other side."
Please pay attention to what is happening around you from now on.
I will help you along!
It's gone!
That's funny!
Eh?
I'm so jealous of your way of looking at things!
"You are so funny, Hibara-san!"
I am so happy I got to know you!
Y-Yeah!
I wonder if she is really praising me.
"But, it has been a long time since I have had a conversation like that."
Along the river.
You were at the chateau de martin?
You know it?
Yes.
dirty your hands tearing my heart I'll get settled then.
into pieces so happy to be back.
"Yes, we're happy to have you back."
if this is the end then we whisper the wind and release it...
You heard about your mother.
I'm so sorry.
I'm back to plead with my father for her life.
I'll be gone from court once I have my answer
"And the matter is settled,"
And you and I will never see each other again.
I don't mean that to sound cruel or angry.
I understand.
You don't want to be seen as someone lying in wait
To reclaim your throne.
Or anything else that now belongs to my brother.
"They brought this back, after clarissa's death."
"I thought you might want to have it,"
As you were more parent to her than I.
They buried her in an unmarked grave
"Near the lake,"
Where the north road ends.
"I asked them to mark it with a cross,"
But it's unhallowed ground.
"What will become of her soul,"
I wonder?
Did she know any happiness in her miserable life?
When she was young.
The villagers who raised her for a time were kind.
She is our world.
A peaceful life.
No big wish list.
We were happy with what was given to us by God.
But...
We didn't understand what doctor said about her disease.
We understood only one thing.
It required lot of money.
"If we don't start the treatment soon, the disease will spread all over her body, and she will die."
"From then on, she fought the disease, and we fought for money."
All our savings were spent on her initial treatment.
The situation was out of our hands.
We had no money.
"Even now, we have no complaints on anyone except on our incapability to save her."
"The day she looked at us to save her life, we died."
"If the operation is not performed in 24 hours, she too will lose  die."
We had no choice.
We can't see her die.
"So, we sent her an orphanage, and dying before her."
Please don't mistake us.
We had no other choice.
You're often asking for charity.
Is this for you or for everyone?
For me only.
"So, you know the truth."
It's alright.
Father went to bring money.
He will bring it.
Operation will be over.
"It's you who said that if we get things very easily, there will no kick in it."
It's true.
"If death comes easier, there is no kick in it."
Lewd pervert!
Even the other day...
Your illustrations are really erotic.
"You can't just say that to a girl, s-so suddenly!"
Do you have to get that angry?
I was talking about how I was requesting lewd illustrations from my little sister!
"L-Lewd illustrations are my job, and I like it, so it's okay!"
But you can't talk about stuff like that!
Why?
Th-That's...
"Big Brother, you idiot!"
Dunce!
Light-novel protagonist!
Fine.
I won't say it again.
It's fine if you understand.
"I-In the first place, Big Brother, you're all sorts of no good."
All sorts?
F-For instance...
That's right!
You stay at home too much on days off!
"Writing is my side job, so of course I'd be home working!"
Even during summer vacation?
Right.
"Back then, everything I wrote was getting turned down, so I pulled a lot of all-nighters."
So I forgot to make you meals.
"The despair I felt when meals didn't arrive even after thumping the floor do you know how that feels, Big Brother?"
Come out of your room and eat.
I think I've lost if I leave my room!
"Even if you say it like a famous quote, it's not cool."
"By the way, I noticed you blog and stream stuff."
I-Is that bad?
I'm looking for my brother
You are mistaken
Your brother is not here
I'm here for my brother
He's in the antique shop in the Xinlung Town
"""Antique shop"""
Alright... then your brother must have a name
Naturally; he's called Yian Luyan
"Sir, something has come up in the shop please come again tomorrow"
I'm sorry...
"Oh, my dear sir"
How can you... mess around with sir's name?
Why not?
That's what he's called
"Sir, it seems you're a novice in the boxer world"
Close the door
Okay
"Come, follow me... this way"
You are...
"Master Yian, he claimed to be your brother"
"It's you, Little Bat"
How come you are here?
"Brother, it's good that you recognize me"
"Good, you're quite grown up"
I'll see how much you've learnt from teacher
"Wang, please attend the counter there's no business for you here"
Yes
Come
Not bad.
You're half as good as teacher and 70-80 percent of mine
You've overpraised me
How is teacher keeping?
Adriana!
"No, wait!"
"Yes, he is quite free for the night!"
"Lucrecia,"
Lucrecia!
"Yes, Luigi?"
"Come immediatedly, I must speak with you."
"I am coming, just a moment."
Luigi?
"What is wrong, why so nervous?"
"Its one of the models, I remember her from somewhere, but don't know where!"
Which one?
The red headed one.
"You are imagining things, Luigi, she is one of our must trusted models."
"Do you think that all the precautions our organisation has taken, are useless?"
Its that we must not take any risks.
"Has it dawned on you that it is insane for all of us to remain here, together?"
"Any slight error, can finish our organisation, with one blow."
You know it is necessary.
"I have been working here for the last two months, and nothing abnormal has happened."
"All is rolling along, please Luigi, do not worry."
"Say, Lucrecia, when do you go on stage?"
"In just a moment,"
Don't you enjoy seeing me as an entertainer in a night club?
You would enjoy it even more to see me as a designer of swimwear.
"can you help me , please?"
May I?
Thanks
I must congratulate you.
You swim quite well.
"I have already thanked you, what else can I say to you, Mr. Dinamo?"
"Ah, you know my name, that means you have heard of me."
Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island...
Have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
That's very odd.
There's an opening in the ground.
Is this the back door?
That's not natural.
We want to take a look at the well.
Down to the water!
Might there be clues down there?
What the hell's that?
Do you see that?
- Wow.
- Down slow.
This well may be associated with the Templars.
- Whoa!
"- What do you got, Tony?"
"Right here on these rocks, I've got a triangle."
This thing's amazing.
There is an island in the North Atlantic where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years.
"So far, they have found bits of gold chain, a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, even a 17th century Spanish coin."
"To date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery."
"And, according to legend, one more will have to die before the treasure can be found."
"Jack, why don't you hack that tree out of the way."
- Wow.
- That's my big discovery.
"Well, honestly, David, that is quite odd."
"A few days ago, during a meeting in the war room,"
"Rick, Marty and members of the Oak Island team were introduced to New York based writer and researcher Zena Halpern by area historian Doug Crowell."
- Hello?
"- Hi, Zena, it's Doug."
"I don't have a problem with hugging, either."
Get away from me!

To repeat:
"In a press conference just held, the Beijing government has announced that if there are no signs of a resolution by 6:00, the situation will inevitably develop into a serious crisis."
"In response, Secretary-General Chang of South China, also known as the Democratic Federation of China, questioned if there was some connection to the terrorist acts committed by the unidentified AS..."
Listen up.
"We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" We have until 6:00 AM, which means we have 90 minutes left."
"""Burning Hong Kong"" If we fail, that's it."
"If we fail, that's it."
Hong Kong will become a sea of flames.
And I doubt it will stop there.
You kept her face pretty?
Apparently you're soft on women.
Haven't you found Yu Fang yet?
All of the preparations are complete.
Just watch.
"Big Sis, this is Yu Lan!"
I'm surrounded by all these scary men!
Tell 'em who you are.
Wait. so if you're not gossip girl
You must know who she is.
No. i just hacked into her server over spring break.
I was bored.
And now we have access to every e-mail that gets sent to her.
I can't believe she gets
All these posts that she doesn't report.
No. no. boring.
Apparently you dye your hair.
Yeah we have this theory
That either she can't substantiate some of them...
Or she waits till the perfect moment for maximum damage.
I wish i could be more helpful.
No you--you have been so helpful.
Can i actually borrow you for a minute?
I'd like you to help me dig deeper.
Nothing in here's good enough to beat the new girl...
Except for this.
No way. would you really use that?
I-i don't think i can.
If you did you'd totally win.
"Yeah,and then i could abolish the monarchy forever."
You going to nate's party?
No. i thought vanessa and i would hit a movie instead.
And here we go. all right
It's your last party of high school.
Now i know you don't love your classmates
But you just shared four years with them. honor that.
And i suspect there may be a couple of people
"That you'd like to stay friends with,or at least one person."
Yeah. yeah serena said kinda the same thing.
We neutralized the last zombie specimens.
"Thanks to Hybra Tech, there hasn't been a single zombie outbreak in over 10 years."

THE RETURN OF MORTOS PART 4
- NECROPOLIS
Entry to the exclusion zone without permission is forbidden.
You like the singing?
Nathalia Lavina.
She is the Russian Britney Spears.
How much further?
"Don't be so nervous, we will be there in a couple of minutes."
You are sure that they are here?
"Yes, they are here my friend."
This is the best place to keep them safe.
This is it.
"Don't worry, the Geiger-Counter is a precaution."
The level of radiation is the same as a ray-x of teeth.
Bullshit you hear about this place...
Just to get more money from you Americans.
What was that?
Don't worry.
Suppose someone finds us here?
Everything is fine my friend.
I have made arrangements for the security for this place.
We are in the base of the main reactor.
"You can make a ""tour"" if you like."
Would you like to see the place where they make the big boo-boo?
No!
Let's cut the 50 cent tour and tell me where the hell they are.
Behind you.
The last of the Trioxin-5 canisters.
Is this all of them?
Try and rest.
"You know, Nathan, the dying have taught me one thing... that you can look death in the face and go on living."
Our mission here is to keep them company.
Keep company with those about to die so that they can depart in peace.
"Great, but what's it got to do with me?"
"Me, my."
"My little consciousness, my little comforts, my little life."
"What about others, Nathan, do you ever think about them?"
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?
"If you knew he was going to blow his brains out, why didn't you do something?"
Why didn't you try to listen to him?
"Who kept Dennis company so he'd ""depart in peace?"""
"Anyway, how did you know he was going to die?"
"This time I want an answer, none of your..."
- I saw it.
- You saw it?
- Yes.
- How did you see it?
Was it written on his face?
- Yes.
- Yes?
"Listen, I'm beat."
"I didn't sleep last night because of you,"
- and I've got to be at work...
"- Nathan, people who come here, they've already traveled a long road paved with suffering."
But they have had time to prepare themselves.
But often death comes... unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.
"Yes, I know, yes."
"For instance, say you cross the street at the wrong moment, or the body just gives out..."
just like that.
"I know you're thinking about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
"She died trying to hide something from Jeanine, something that was entrusted to Abnegation"
- a long time ago.
- Marcus!
Stop!
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
You mind telling me what's inside?
A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
"Divergents will destroy our society, unless we destroy them."
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them!
Every last one of them.
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.
Go with happiness.
I really don't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, just try to blend in."
"I'm trying to blend in, it's just not working."
"Coming through, on you right."
Okay here we go.
Oh look a rainbow.
It's pretty.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioning passifism.
I love this place.
I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the hurricane straits.
"We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses."
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now.
This is serious.
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.
But I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops.
There's a problem.
Mom!
I'm so happy you're here.
Where's dad?
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.
I'll get him back.
Where is my mother?
She's in the healing hut.
So many injured.
What happened?
Her soul is trapped in the spirit world.
"Oh, my goodness."
How long has she been away?
Almost a week.
"I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away."
"You're the only one who can help her now, mom."
How much longer can she survive like this?
I don't know.
But she's very strong to have lasted this long.
I talked to the rebels.
They said Unalaq's got the Southern portal surrounded.
Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away.
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
There's no use in talking anymore.
We know what our mission is.
would you think it possible that I was once considered to be attractive?
Your looks are okay.
-I was fishing for a compliment.
-I don't go for that stuff.
-What stuff?
-compliments to women about looks.
I never met a dame yet didn't know if she was good-Iooking or not without being told.
And some of them give themselves credit for more than they've got.
"I once went out with a dame who told me, ""I'm the glamorous type."""
"She says, ""I am the glamorous type."" I says, ""So what?"""
-And what did she say then?
-She didn't say nothing.
-That shut her up like a clam.
-Did it end the romance?
"well, it ended the conversation, that was all."
There's some men that are took in by this hollywood glamour stuff...
-...and there's some men that aren't.
-You belong in the second category.
-That's right.
-I cannot imagine any witch of a woman...
-...casting a spell over you.
-That's right.
"You're simple, straightforward and honest."
"A little bit on the primitive side, I should think."
-To interest you a woman would have to--
-To lay her cards on the table.
"well, I never did care for wishy-washy people."
"That was why when you walked in last night, I said to myself:"
"""My sister has married a man."" Of course."
-That was all I couId teII--
-How about cutting the rebop!
stanley!
News waits for no one...
Not even Chloe.
"You texted her, you left her, three voicemail messages at the apartment."
She's not Helen Keller.
She'll get the message and meet us there.
It wouldn't kill us to wait a few more minutes.
I agree with Mr. Olsen.
Why are we outside of the kitchen?
"It's a little late for a snack, isn't it?"
"I've seen you around here before, haven't I?"
You work for Lex.
He has nothing to do with this.
I'm here about that photograph you took.
Which photograph would that be?
Because I take a whole lot of pictures.
L. Luthor in his office before he killed himself.
I want that photo destroyed.
His death was tragic enough without it being sensationalized by the media.
You could have said that before you broke out the heavy artillery.
"As soon as we saw it, I immediately jumped on the delete button."
This is all a big misunderstanding.
You're lying.
I deleted it.
"After I saw your text message,"
I went into the mainframe and pulled it from your hard drive.
But the transfer log shows you uploaded the file to a second server with a cloaked IP Address.
I want to know where.
- You shot me?
!
- You weren't cooperating.
- How about a warning?
- Tell me or she dies.

Let's make good the promise we made to each other 20 years ago.
I hope... you will come here at the soonest for Simran's wedding to Kuljit
Read on
She's shy!
See Lajjo?
"That's our etiquette, our culture"
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure
"In the heart of London, I've kept India alive!"
Still staring?
"Lajjo, your daughter's wedding!"
Celebrate it with sweets
Chutki!
I'm so happy today
Can I say one thing?
- Say four things
It'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?
"Ever since she was a baby, she has known that she is engaged to Kuljit"
That she knows.
But20 years...
- Don't you worry!
Simran is going to be so happy... you'll pray that she never gets the evil eye!
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God!
"Hilarious, right?"
Totally.
You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes... probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner... smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while she was waiting to pick her kids up
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady."
"And I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist... the one wearing the male birth control.
"I was gonna go with ""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
- All right?
He's a hero.
- Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff, I have a date."
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
- Great.
I will.
I promise you.
"Farewell, cousin."
What is the rush?
"I pray you tell, My Lord, I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear it shall be Romeo, whom I hate, rather than Paris, whom I despise!"
Here comes your father.
You can tell him so yourself.
My girl is like a channel.
"What, more tears?"
The level of the sea will start to lift if much more water flows from your sweet eyes.
"Wife, have you told her of her marriage plans?"
"I have, and she will have none of it, I swear."
Soft.
Soft.
"Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
How?
Will she none?
Does she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?
"Does she not think her blessed, unworthy as she is, that we have brought so worthy a gentleman to be her groom?"
"Thankful I am, and grateful for your love, but proud I cannot be of what I hate."
"How... how-how-how, chopped logic."
What is this?
"""Proud"" and ""I thank you,"" but ""I thank you not."""
"Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds!"
"Be ready, lady, Thursday morning next, to go with Paris to St. Peter's Church"
- or I will drag thee thither on a rail!
- Are you mad?
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees."
Will you not give me leave to plead my cause?
You...
I tell you what.
Leave my house!
You either get dressed up and behave like you have some self respect you'd just leave!
"Steve, will you fix me a drink please?"
Sure.
Having a problem with the Neanderthal man back there?
Yeah.
"Relax, you're fabulous."
Don't make a penny of domestic quarrels.
What are you staring at big cock?
Sorry I wish I knew how to tell you...
"If you got something to say copper, just spit it out."
You are in a dangerous situation.
"Man, listen let me tell you something you guys won't catch me, man, never!"
And I don't understand why you're being so stupid copper to let me know what's coming down that's really dumb.
Copper?
"What does that mean, I can help you."
"Fuck off, get out of my way."
"You don't understand, I can help you."
Oh!
You're a rat man.
"You want me to put you on the take, so you'll let me know when your invasion come in?"
Invasion?
Yeah what do you know about the invasion?
"Oh, shut your face scab, I don't play it your way."
"Just forget it fuck off, man!"
I don't need you man!
Fuck off!
Still sitting in front of the mirror.
Adrian is here.
I didn't come here to see Adrian.
Well I don't have any dope for you.
You have to see her about that.
"Hmph, monster."
You should have just behaved and stayed shut away in school.
Kiefer...
Is she alive?
She's already been thrown into prison here.
"To begin with, who would have expected her to come back?"
"Years ago, the eldest of her sisters died in a spy crackdown."
The remaining two received our country's reeducation.
"We had the younger sister remain here, as a sign of loyalty to our country."
Wouldn't it be quicker to just say you took her hostage?
She was a foolish girl as well.
"Even though her younger sister is dead since long ago, in the end, she was worthless."
Nothing is accomplished as long as the Astal brat survives.
So he was your real target.
Do you have any idea how much of a reprimand we got from those people?
Is that what you called me here for?
To complain and moan?
"Mind your tongue, monster!"
Ow...
That one hurt a little.
Of course it did!
Are you mocking me?
You're the one doing the mocking here.
I'm always the one being mocked.
I've had enough punishment.
Could you throw me in jail before I drop dead?
"The king will grant one request, with your imprisonment."
"I'd sure like to stop this bleeding, but..."
"Oh, I know."
"Hey, Kiefer."
"If you keep taking afternoon naps, your grades will drop."
What's this?
I found out why
Bin-Khalid's people wanted the strongbox.
Inside there was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells that bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.
"It looked like 15, maybe 20 cells but I didn't have the list for very long."
He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
I am still waiting to find out what that is.
Do you believe he'd really do that?
"He's angry, and he's unstable."
I do.
We'll keep looking for him here.
Let us know if he makes contact.
"Yeah, I am heading over to 13th."
Keep looking for Grimes.
I'm going to talk to Keith.
"Rebecca, what the hell's going on?"
Have you lost your mind?
"- Keith, listen to me."
"- No, let me out of here, now!"
I can't do that.
Not until I know if I can trust you.
Trust me?
Because I'm the one who's acted completely out of bounds?
The ranger squad that killed bin-Khalid
Was attacked this morning.
Four of them were murdered and their families.
What are...
"The rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to - the directors of CIA, NSA... and you."
And you think I gave them up?
No.
I don't.
But I have to be sure.
"I want to clear you, but I need your help."
"- Come on, boys, get a move on."
- You always say the people are on our side.
So why do they treat us like this?
They stare at us as if we were animals.
"To them, we're no better than the government troops."
"If I were you, I'd alter my behaviour."
Then this will change.
This stuff will give you every disease in the world.
"- Shit, I've been hit really badly."
"- Nonsense, we'll fix that."
This is madness.
Who will benefit from us blowing up the dam?
"Put him here, but carefully."
Why do we destroy bridges and farmers' houses and everything they own?
"You're an engineer, not a revolutionary."
The commandante will know why.
He might not know either.
Do you have a smoke?
"We haven't got any dressing material, but there's a hospital in San Juan."
They might cure him.
There's a priest there who knows something about medicine.
You know so much.
It's kind of you to try to help us.
"If you take me with you, I'll help you fight as well."
I always win at war games.
I'm the fastest one when it comes to climbing trees.
"At war, climbing trees is the most important thing."
"He's right with one thing, Mariá."
José has to be taken to San Juan.
You should go with him.
"Jaime, Getullio and another man will accompany you."
- But I thought...
But I know someone who can beat the Shaolin.
Which chamber does he belong?
He's not a priest.
He's Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung-wu!
"According to our regulations, a guilty person cannot be our representative."
"Furthermore, Chao Fung-wu isn't our student..."
He's the only one who knows how to fight the Chin Kang Fist.
"If he can represent us, he can win."
Then all charges will be dropped.
That's a good point.
"If he wins, he'll be pardoned."
"$50,000, they do pass."

"michael, I've searched my data banks thoroughly,"
I can't find one redeeming quality about gambling.
"KITT, look at it this way:"
gambling is all odds.
It's pure mathematics.
"Come on, I'll show you."
I'd rather not.
"A little computer blackjack, $1 a hand."
"Yes, but beyond that."
The law is too narrow for me.
"For instance, the felon who never gets caught is still a felon, right?"
Right.
"Should he be noted, too?"
- I guess he should.
But how would you find one?
- That's another question.
"When we agree about that, the things get complicated."
"Is it a crime when father spends all his paycheck on booze, while his children walk around in torn shoes?"
That's a complex question.
Is it a crime when one doesn't care about his ill parents?
"I guess it is, if you say so."
That's why one should record it all.
"Otherwise, statistics is not complete."
"That's ok, but..."
I can't see why...
"- Why is all this for, right?"
Yes.
- I'm not surprised.
"As a matter of fact, I haven't explained you all about my work and what is the result derived from it even from afar."
You don't see a purpose.
Right?
"Explain me, then."
"Roughly, at least."
"Look, knowing about something means a lot, right?"
Right.
"The closer we get to the complete knowledge about what a crime is and how it occurs,"
I guess the sooner we'll destroy it.
"Yes, maybe."
- It's doubtless.
That's it.

"Yeah, Arnie was just leaving."
"Oh, yeah, right."

I just gotta set the lineup for the Main Stage.

"I know it's probably not my place to say anything, um, but have you read the sketches?"
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, 'cause I'm worried that the Little Bo Peep one might be kinda..."
lame.
It's not lame.
"It's fucking horrible, goddamn offensive."
Ohh.
I thought I just didn't get it.
"[laughs] Ho, ho, the writers don't get it."
"I mean, it's two guys never been laid writing their idea of what a woman might say."
"If you told them your twat was horizontal, they wouldn't argue."
"Okay, because I was thinking, maybe we could change it to ""The Little Bo Peep Show,"" and men show up thinking it's gonna be this sexy peep show, but instead, the girl behind the glass is wearing"
"this ridiculous dress, not showing any skin, because she wants to be taken seriously as an actress, doing her one-woman show about her wayward sheep."
[laughs]
Why don't you take a swing at rewriting it?
Really?
Then why did you expect me?
Be seated.
Come on out with it.
Quick.
I can't wait for long.
Right kind of mood to have a cold drink.
What would you have?
"Limca, thumsup, or orange..."
You want to tell me something?
- Sory...?
"Oh... yes, I want to tell you something."
"You see, Miss Sheetal, I want to clear something with you."
So that there won't be any misunderstanding in future.
"Ifyou think, I am just putting on a show, but I love you vey much... lfyou think so, then let me tell you that you are right."
But...
I never thought that...
"Look Sheetal, don't tell me that you don't like me or love me."
I am a police officer. I promptly catch a person who tells a lie.
If I am not wrong...
did you say you love me?
But you are behaving as ifyou are giving me a speeding ticket.
Surely there are other ways too to express your love?
Indeed.
But they are worn out and outdated.
So I thought I'd ty a new style.
To help me succeed.

"Right again, Jeeves!"
- This is a beautiful spot.
"- It was, sir."
"- What do you mean, ""It was""?"
- I regret to report that that woman is here.
- Woman?
What woman?
- Our visitor of last night.
"Oh, that one."
"Well, that is a coincidence."
"An extraordinary coincidence, sir."
May I suggest for your own good... that we motor on till we come to another hotel?
"Definitely not, Jeeves."
I refused to have my rest interfered by a mere female.
"Frankly, I'm afraid, sir, that we may get involved in another embarrassing situation."
This is different.
Remember what those Scotland Yard men told us about this girl?
It is our duty to remain here and watch her... in case the occasion arises to aid our country.
"Yes, sir."
"I find your patriotism most admirable, sir."
Then you haven't been able to find Mr. McDermott?
"No, not yet."
I'm sorry.
- I hope nothing's happened to him.
"- No, I don't think so."
If you tell me where you found him and about what time... it might help to clear things up.
It was quite late.
I was staying with my aunt in London.
"Oh, I— I see."
I'm beginning to think we should notify the police.
"No, no, no."
That won't be at all necessary.
It was rigged to explode.
A S.W.A.T. agent was killed.
- Was anthrax involved?
- No.
Then that's not the final target.
"You look troubled, my friend."
You killed one of my men.
I was here with you.
The second location was a trap.
One of my agents was killed in the explosion.
This is war.
We expect casualties.
Shouldn't you?
- He was a good man.
"- Well... if he would convert, there would be no reason for him to fear death."
What do you say to his family?
I say:
Where... were you to mourn... when my son was murdered?
- His son?
- Did you see that?
"When he told the story about his childhood, the bomb landing in the bazaar, his behavior changed."
We know he was lying.
Garcia couldn't find any record of a bombing during the time Jind Allah was a boy.
"Exactly, but this time when he mentioned his son, he looked at his hands, like he had to concentrate to control his anger."
That first story wasn't about him.
It was about his son.
Which means it must have been more recent.
Garcia.
"I need you to look for a bombing again in Egypt, but this time anything in the last ten years."
On it.
"We're looking for civilian casualties, an 8-year-old boy."
Okay.
You'd know it if you went into the kitchen and checked out those supposed violations.
Though you shouldn't have to check.
What's all this?
I just keep thinking about the Burkes.
There's something... something not right with these two.
"Just 'cause they say their suite is haunted, doesn't mean they're ""not right."""
"I had the development office pull the, uh, information from the sale of Monica's condo... just so we could run a more comprehensive background check."
What are you looking for?
"Ah, what are we looking for?"
That's the question.
I wanna run a complete search on these two.
"Previous addresses, former employers, whatever you can think of."
I want as much information as possible on those two.
Sorry I asked.
Hmm?
You busy?
No.
[Together] Hey.
What's wrong?
You first.
You mean you didn't hear about Mystique being shut down?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did hear about that."
Health code violations.
I thought it must be some kind of mistake.
Hello.
"Everyone knows you're Montecito's official ""germophobe"" when it comes to Mystique."
Thank you.
It's just because I refused to go out with that crazy-ass health inspector.
So what's your problem?
Paul Logan.
I heard he was in town.
I backed up after that.
"- So, how did you end up at Skirt?"
- I just love Skirt.
"They have the best photography of any magazines, really... the most innovative, stylish, artistic shoots around."
How did you end up in magazines?
"I had an excentric uncle... who was my idol when I was growing up... he was a sort of black sheep, hip, rebel type."
"While my parents are always trying to drag me off to polo, blablabla... he was always abducting me and taking me..."
- on the most amazing adventures.
- Sounds like a cool uncle.
"Yeah, he was."
He was pretty much my savior when I was a child.
"My parents had a messy split, and he saw me through that."
He knew I liked to paint and he always encouraged.
So why don't you paint full time?
That's what I'm trying to do... but I like graphic design and it helps pay the bills.
So I made a routine out of that.
"Furthermore, I don't think anybody would like to buy my paintings."
Except maybe a pizza parlor.
I'm sure people would buy your paintings.
I have to get out of here!
I'm being harrassed!
These little beasts keep snugging me... begging for an autograph...
- annoying me!
- They are children.
And I'm not the fucking Pied Piper.
I don't want them following me.
Shoo!
- Get away!
Go!
- Calm down.
I'm gonna be... half an hour more at this.
Then we take...
I went up to him and told him I admired him and what he stood for and while I was thanking him he asked me if I liked stone crabs.
Halfway through dinner I had a job.
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years and I finally found a place where you can make a difference.
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We got to keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
I got to get that report see where it leads.
"What if, while you're playing detective Wakeley decides it'd be healthier to disappear?"
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we must take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own you'll feel the full weight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
"Where I come from, that's a compliment."
Hold on a minute.
To what?
Your ambition?
John Pappas' coattails?
"Burger, fries, Coke and a lemon pudding."
I'll take these.
The mayor's boy gets the lemon pudding.

"I'll send Carls your best, because you're not going."
You have a very important project to do.
Have you noticed people's desks lately?
Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors... since Todd Oldham's debut collection.
It's all about black.
"What it this bullshit, anyway?"
This is not Lucky Charm cereal.
"This is not ""Oz""."
"This is not ""Skills""."
I want you to replace each and every one... of these hideous five-a-dime acessories immediately.
Everybody's desks should be in ship-shape by tomorrow morning.
Philip's just messengered over his new line of desk acessories.
"From now on, everything should be black."
Those bitches... they all said:
"""Brown is the new black""."
"I got news for you, baby:"
Black... could kick brown's ass.
"Jocelyn, what are you doing working so late?"
I'm making the bulletin boards clash-proof.
God forbid we have a stray yellow damn tag!
- I'm so sorry!
"No, that's the..."
"Actually, the one thing that we haven't done."
We haven't had sex since we've been here.
We've barely even touched each other.
"Now, Cynthia and I are in a terrible spot."
"I come to this island, I come to the program to get some answers, find out my animal spirit..."
Yeah.
Let me help you out on the whole animal spirit thing.
It's gonna be awesome!
It always is.
"It's like if you go to a tarot card reader for past lives, you're always something cool..."

'Cause it's not to me.
"Tell you what+ If I get kicked off this island, I'm gonna blame all of you."
And I can't believe I let the two of you derail me!
We derailed you?
That's correct.
"If you kept a closer eye on Trudy, she wouldn't have strayed so far from the pack, all right?"
"She's not a dog, Jason."
Yeah?
"Well, listen, she's been very selfish, hasn't been a very good teammate."
I can tell you that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Look, I made promises, I let her down."
You don't know the ins and outs of our relationship.
Is that what it is?
It's a relationship?
"It's been two weeks, okay?"
All right?
That's not a relationship.
Sorry.
"E, what are you doing here?"
I thought you might need some company.
I lied to my father once.
It was three months before he died.
I'd stolen his car keys and taken the car around the block even though I was only 1 4.
"Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"My dad went out the next morning, and I had parked the car a foot back from where he had, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how he noticed that."
[Bob clears his throat]
"And, uh, this contract dated October 8th, this is for more concrete?"
"Uh, yeah."
Yes.
"And is, uh, this your signature on the bottom?"
"Yes, it is."
"Well, your signature's more illeg... ille... illegible than mine."
"So, um, isn't there usually a sales tax denoted on receipts?"
"Uh, I guess so."
Can't say I noticed.
You guess so.
You can't say.
Hmm.
Yes or no?
You're in business.
You're familiar with sales tax.
is sales tax a part of every transaction or not?
"Yes, it is."
So you or someone connected to the project broke the law here.
"Mr. Dumanjik, I'm the architect, not the contractor."
"I may have signed for delivery of materials, but I was not charged with paying the bill or handling any of the paperwork."
Did you check to see that the tax was paid?
- No.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engaged to Jimmy, too?"
"'Cause if that's true, he better hope he's dead, or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connected on a deep, spiritual level."
"From then on, any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with Special Ops.
Lance Corporal Finn's record does not indicate he was involved with Special Operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see Lance Corporal Finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for Iraq.
How'd you meet?
At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked  is that when we talked,  he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy, he had seen real action."
"And I was  feeling patriotic that night,  so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get engaged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay, they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
- I know.
I'm used to it.
- Now listen.
- Red fuck!
We need help.
Somebody has been stealing our story ideas and trading them...
"- to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue."
"- I know all about it, pussy."
- Do you know who it is?
- We're not gonna do it that way.
"First, you're going to tell me what you know and I'm gonna"
- tell you if you're right.
"- I have a sneaking suspicion... it could be Pierre Larroux, our make-up artist."
Look deeper.
Look closer.
Follow the fashion!
What do you mean?
They are brilliant!
Did you design them?
No.
I have to give credit where credit's due.
- Sebastian designed them.
"- Yes, darling, you do know... that I have a better grasp on the subject than he."
"It's time to pile into the town cars and you can check the list... for what booths you're assigned to, and the times."
"And remember... when you're not in the booths, you're still representing Skirt."
I wish I could always have a cock this big this close to my face.
- You are disgusting!
- Actually... my room service boy in Paris... wasn't so different from the dimensions on this shirt
You should see him serve more than a petit dejanuai.
You chaseabout!
What did you have on your customs card... when you came back:
Business or pleasure?
What's that pounding?
Your boyfriend is up on the roof replacing the loose shingles.
"Okay, so it wasn't Santa claus."
"But you can understand what got me there, right?"
The poor guy's only been here one night and you're putting him to work?
He volunteered.
Mike Biggs volunteered to climb up on the roof and start relaying shingles?
"He was reluctant at first, but I promised him a pan of brownies and he shimmied up that ladder like his ass was on fire."
"Mom, we shouldn't take advantage of Mike's good nature."
Some might say his jolly nature.
"You know, he's been working hard."
We should make him a nice dinner tonight.
That's a great idea.
Remember our Sunday night dinners with daddy?
"We'll make pot roast, mashed potatoes, and banana cream pie."
Daddy's favorite.
"Oh, it's not Mike's favorite."
Who the hell's talking about Mike?
"I'm telling you, Carl, all I did was put a couple screws in a cabinet door and her mom made me French toast."
"I know, I feel like king midas."
Not the muffler guy.
You got to get a library card.
"Hang on, I got to earn myself some brownies."
"Hey, how you doing up there?"
You working hard?
"Oh, yeah."
Seeing you up there blocking the sun reminds me of when my husband was alive.
He was always working on the roof.
"Well, Chicago winters..."
lots of wear and tear.
I may be up here for a while.
You hungry?
But we'll fight on.
"That's what Mr. Churchill says, and I believe him."
"I think you must be insane, father, if you believe what these people say."
They're sick.
And they don't know a thing.
[Door slams]
"These notes are very good, very thorough, milner."
"Thank you, sir."
I'm afraid they don't tell us the one thing that we need to know-- who fired the shots.
Or why they were fired in the dark.
And if Spencer was the actual target...
That's very likely.
Why wait for an after-dinner meeting when everyone's around?
Easier and less risky to wait until he's left or leaving the hotel or even gone up to his room and shoot him while he's asleep.
"Yes, I know."
I wondered about that.
Why wait for the exact moment when the lights go out?
Because you can't be seen.
"Well, you can't see either."
How do you know you're getting the right target?
You spoke to woolton?
"Yes, it was his gun, but I don't believe for a second he fired it."
"And it was thrown away, wasn't it?"
He'd have taken it with him.
"How about David Lane, sir?"
"He could have taken the gun, made his way through the hotel."
Maybe the lights went out just as he was about to fire.
"They were all in the room, the room was blacked out, the door was closed."
Stanley was sitting right outside.
Then he'd have seen him.
Exactly.
What about Stanley Ellis?
I'm sorry.
I thought this office was vacant.
I'm Kitty Pimms.
I've just been hired.
- By whom?
- Woolsey Nicholls.
Woolsey?
So you're replacing Kentucky?
A little soon after her death.
"Seems distasteful, don't you think?"
"It does, but it also speaks to the efficiency of your Human Resources department."
- Mm-hm.
I wonder how else you'll be replacing Kentucky.
Since I'm a withered hag tattered by every grain in the hourglass Betty's Bees still needs a fresh face.
"And after what happened, well no one wants to think about that when they're buying lip balm."
Welcome to Betty's Bees.
Kentucky's affairs were clearly a bee in Betty Bee's bonnet.
"Oh, I just wanted to say what an honor it is to be working with you..."
Thank you.
Get out.
And so Chuck got out.
But the question remained:
Betty Bee:
Coconspirator or killer?
"Kentucky was the new face of Betty's, which does give Betty motive."
Being replaced by better-looking always gives you motive.
"But Kentucky was sabotaging Betty's Bees, trademark which was owned by Woolsey, which gives Woolsey motive."
Woolsey's a businessman.
"Somebody sabotage him he'd send in a swarm of lawyers, not bees."
I know.
They were lovers of the same-sex persuasion and the key is for their love nest.
We've ruled out workplace romance.
May I ask if you have any data on this?
"My colleague, he... he administered this drug to 18 volunteers, and 72% of them said that they had these profoundly spiritual experiences."
Where... where... where can we get these mushrooms?
It's not mushrooms.
We would be using medical-grade psilocybin.
When can I try this?
Good afternoon.
"So, we have some news."
Uh...
"We have all of Jacob's test results back, and, um, we can't find anything."
S-so this means everything is fine.
"Well, that's awful."
There's nothing you can fix?
- I'm afraid not.
"- We can't find anything, so we have to assume that this is Jerusalem syndrome."
Look at him.
He's had a spiritual conversion.
"- Ian, is that man sane?"
- ...
Fortify you.
Religious ecstasy isn't considered insanity.
"As much as we want to fix it, if Jacob's not ill..."
- ...she'asah il kol tzorki.
- There's nothing that we could do.
I have nowhere to go.
He gave away our house.
Barukh attah adonai melkh ha-olam she-asah il kol tzorki.
This is not what I signed up for!
You are supposed to take care of me!
Not me... you.
I gave up my career because of you.
I can't even get groceries.
"I want to introduce you to the First Daughter of the United States, my daughter Catherine Selina Meyer."
Catherine.
Always a delight to have...
She is such a beautiful girl.
I'm so proud of her.
"Well, we have another minute or so before we're prepared to call Virginia."
Just checking a couple of precincts.
We've made some premature calls this evening.
So we're anxious to be absolutely certain this time.
Why don't we meet some of the people who lift me up?
I'd like you to meet them.
"Guys, come on out."
How about these great faces?
Incredible scenes.
Never happened before.
Very emotional moment.
"Dan, do you wish you were there?"
I'm sure it's a very exciting place to be at.
There's never been an election like this.
No.
You must want to be there.
"Folks, you don't know her, but this is Karen Collins."
And she has been a friend of mine for a while.
Yep.
And Amy Brookheimer is here.
Amy Brookheimer who so successfully ran my campaign until she became unwell.
I'll tell you somebody else that is not here tonight who was with the campaign...
"Sounds like it could be you, Dan."
"Well, I would be incredibly touched."
"And that is, of course, Leslie Kerr."
"I'm sure Leslie is thanking you, too."
And I'm hearing we can now project a Virginia result.
Hello.
We have someone else in the room.
Leo?
Print on the glasses isn't Paul Fordyce's and we can't find a match on the database.
Someone helped him kill himself?
Or we've been dealing with a double act.
'We have entrusted our sister Vivian to God's mercy and now we commit her body to the ground.
'Earth to earth.
'Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust 'in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ#
'I know this.
"Have you, ah, have you seen the original?"
"'It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
'It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
'But I'm drawn to these images.
Why?
"'Looking for reassurance, I suppose#"
Richard!
This glass is new.
There'll be two sets of prints on it.
"One will be mine, the other will match the print you're looking for."
Nikki?
"The other print belongs to the person who helped Paul Fordyce kill Dave Stubbs, Lucy Philips, Tony Lane, Henry Elliot and Carla Burns, and Paul Fordyce himself."
The guy who came here and said he was being followed by Paul Fordyce.
The guy who picked up that picture and said that he liked looking at these images just to see if they hinted at the life beyond.
Who couldn't resist turning the bodies over so he could look into their eyes.
Richard Henderson.
It's a match.
Armed police.
Armed police!
"Death that has killed my daughter, ties my tongue and drains my eyes and will not let me grieve."
"Oh, child."
My soul more than my child.
Dead are you now.
Alack.
"My child is dead... and with my child, all my joys are buried."
"Oh, come, sir, for shame."
"And think of her poor soul, freed now from care and safe in heaven's bliss."
Give up your grief and bring sweet-smelling flowers to lay upon her corpse with gentle tears.
"Then take her to church, where she may sleep among her kin for all eternity."
The plans we made for joyful celebration must turn instead to mark our sorrowing woe.
Our merry hymns to sullen dirges change.
"Sir, madam, make ready for our march, to take this lovely child to her grave."
We cannot know why it is heaven's will.
But we must trust in him who orders all.
Stop!
"I beseech you, sir."
In heaven's name.
"Say now, are you a holy man of God?"
"I am a novice, but I serve God, yes."
Have you made study in the art of herbs?
- I have.
- My son is sick.
I have an errand to perform in Mantua.
- By when?
- Before tonight.
Mantua is but two leagues away.
I'll take you there myself.
Then show me your child.
"Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No, thank you, Jack."
- Cousin.
You were so funny last night.
- Ohh.
I was wondering if you could help us out?
Oh I'd be delighted to share my... comedic expertise.
We who are clowns are known for our generosity.
Maybe you can help us settle an argument we were having.
Shoot.
What's funnier?
This... or this?
Or... is two at once funny?
How about... this?
Is this funny?
I think... this.
You are so right!
That is funny!
Thank you so much for helping us.
I'm glad I could be of service.
"Now if you'll excuse me,"
I have a class to teach.
"You know, it's a remarkable feeling to be able to make someone else laugh."
"It's almost as if you have the power to get inside their brain, and tickle it."
I can do that with a chopstick.
"Imagine how different war would be, if instead of trying to kill each other, people just showed up armed with jokes."
"But you could still have guns, right?"
"Because, you know, eventually you'd stop laughing, and want to get on with the killing."
You know what I found out?
Humour's subjective.
What do you mean?
"Well, I thought the fact that no one was laughing at you at the comedy club was hysterical."
"Oh, I loved that."
No no.
"No, that wasn't funny."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, who was that?"
Goes by the name of Hector.
"Well dressed, well spoken, a grave manner, spitting image of you, in fact."
Are you referring to what I think you are?
To what do you think I'm referring?
"Every so often, I pay a visit to a friend of mine."
"We have tea and converse, for reasons I do not understand, and with no encouragement on my part, she likes to call me Hector."
Tea?
Tea!
Of course.
"Don't worry, the King will know nothing of these tea parties."
Hector.
I have not yet found the opportunity.
You must be patient.
I cannot be patient.
I know him.
"If I wait, he will find another, but not your equal."
But you agree.
He will find someone else.
This is the first time...
What?
...that I've see you like this.
Not the cold and distant goddess that breaks every man's heart and strikes fear into everyone in the salon but
"but soft, human, vulnerable."
And broken.
Go and see him.
Confront him.
Tell him your feelings.
"You're wasting your time, waiting and hoping."
"If he accepts you back, then you have reaped the rewards of your courage."
And if he rejects me?
-Arul don't go
-Leave me
-Listen
"Whatever happens, none of you should come out, go"
- Let us not

So I surrender
The MLA is already dead
- Who hit him?
- Someone called Arul Kumaran

..to know his condition What can we tell them?
- I will tell them
- Sir what happened?
Your husband is alright
All of you need not worry
I will give you all details after one hour
"Doctor, why did you lie to them?"
"He is very bad The guy who has hit him, Arul is good"
If the cause of death is revealed
Arul's life will be spoilt by litigations
"So, we must create an atmosphere for two days that he is alive"
All of you must co-operate for that
In Hong Kong.
My crazy-ass brother went and got crazy-ass elective surgery in Hong Kong.
- Who does that?
- Short people.
Desperate short people.
I had my legs lengthened.
I couldn't find a surgeon who would do it here.
"Look, it's barbaric, okay?"
They--they broke his legs and they hooked him up to some sort of medieval torture device.
"Yeah, that's to pull the bones apart."
That's the lengthening process.
It's a controversial procedure.
I don't perform it myself.
- Could I take a look?
- Yeah.
They said it'd give me 2 whole inches.
Any word from UNOS?
Not yet.
Dr. Karev is staying in constant contact with them.
How much longer will we have to wait?
Are--are livers and intestines hard to find?
"Well, Jackson's blood type is O-positive."
It shouldn't be too difficult to match.
"But he's had blood transfusions, which means there could be extra antibodies that are hard to match, so we need to be patient, Melinda."
"In the meantime, um, I need to run some tests on Jackson to check his electrolytes."
"We're gonna do everything we can to help your son, mrs."

Oh man !
Have you ever had anything like that in your whole life ?
"If we were rich and didn't have to kill him, we could pay him just to make those cookies for us, all the time."
"Hell, what if the cookies are just the tip of the iceberg ?"
What if he makes brownies ?
"We get so fat, but it'll be so worth it!"
"Anyway, Let's just do it as we said before..."
"I would just run in there, blast him."
You bring anymore ammo?
No.
I thought you said you have some more.
Nah...
I just wanted to sound pro and said I did.
It's not like we're facing five or six jokers who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclub.
"Beside, I was trying to save up for the dresses."
Never got the hang of these.

They might actually check in this part of the town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone, and remember what I said."
They waltz into my court.
"They get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend."
The only treatment for them is death.
You dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.
Tough to get a conviction without a body.
There's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand.
I saw them.
They were there with his name on my son's computer.
"Your son, Kyle sent them."
To himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
He blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
Sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
He wanted to get the coach fired.
This whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.
Wrestle!
You got him!

Mert is failing.
Do you know why I'm saying that Mert's failing?
Because he's not studying.
"I swear to God, I am studying."
You see me studying.
He's lying.
"It's not enough to study, Mr. Mert."
We do.
But having to study for school and selection exam both is very difficult.
What are we going to do then?
We should at least find a solution for the school.
"I thought everything would be okay if I came to school, but this is worse."
"Actually, you know what?"
We should just steal the test papers... and get it over with.
What did you say?
"I didn't say anything, dude."
This is it man!
This is the first time you have ever said something sensible.
"So, are you suggesting that we should steal the papers?"
Are you crazy?
"Actually, I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time... but I wasn't sure if I should or not."

"Oh, nnn..."
What do you consider sex?

"Well, no, there's all kinds of different kinds of sex."
"Okay, then, yes, a bunch, but we used a condom."

"Where I was born, time was told not by the clock or the calendar but by the seasons."
Summer was carefree contentment.
Autumn was that bittersweet time of regret for moments that had ended and things that were yet undone.
And then winter fell with a cold mantle of caution and chill.
It nipped our noses and our arrogance and made use move closer to the warm stoves of memory and desire.
Spring was promise.
But there was a fifth season of love and only the wise or the lucky ones knew where to find it.

What about Brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, Chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at Luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was Lionel Luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you.
You killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but Lionel Luthor left a lot of damage in his wake."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"He did a lot of things, but he'd never commit suicide."
I don't know about that.
He was beyond disturbed
But who sees it in your eyes?
How am I going to behave?
"Those boys are only friends, aren't they?"
Do you think they like it when someone clings to them?
"You'll see, someone will appreciate that more."
Maybe. I haven't yet met anyone who appreciates it more.
They always talk to the kind who cling to everyone immediately.
"The other day your registrar said they pay sixty crowns in Moravia, and us only fifteen."
My sister-in-law's sister said that in Central Slovakia they even pay a hundred.
- l've heard that too.
- Us fifteen...
That's despicable!
"I'm telling you, it's only in Nitra they pay so badly."
"Elsewhere, as you say, it's at least fifty."
"You understand, we're qualified, you're in that society... the Committee for Civil Affairs."
"As a member, they only got me from the music school just to..."
- l feel so worn out...
- You're tired?
- How many more?
- lt's dragging on today.
- Nothing's on time!
- They're saying goodbye at home.
- And have they even paid?
- That photographer...
"Yes, yes..."
- How lovely!
- What's lovely about it?
Really.
What do you see in it?
Look at this... here...
"Don't take it off, if we put..."
"We'll put something blue here, blue buttons, that'll make you a bit slimmer..."
Hollywood party Nobody sleeps tonight
Hollywood party Going a mile a minute
Hollywood party Nobody sleeps tonight
Let the laughter spring out Music ring out
"Satan sing out, ""Yeah, man"""
"At that crashing, furniture-smashing"
Hollywood party Nobody sleeps tonight
"And now, here's to beauty, laughter, romance, music."
On with the biggest party ever given in Hollywood.
Feelin' high
What's the use Feelin' low?
On that wagon On the town
Gonna be up Never down
There's a reason If you'd like to know why
I'm in love
I'm feelin' high
Even the biggest production numbers needed stars.
So Eleanor Powell became MGM's first big dancing star.
In Broadway Melody of 1938 and almost all of her films Eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reel.
Follow in my footsteps
Follow them
Your Broadway And my Broadway
Got that rhythm
Inside me Everybody dance
You are my lucky star
Hear the rhythm of the music And the music of the rhythm
Got a pair of new shoes Got a pair of new shoes
Gotta dance
"Tap your feet Light, long and sweet"
And dance
Dance Now Broadway dance
A Broadway dance and go singing
My mother also wanted to prepare everything for me.
"You pay, you come... I don't know why you come."
A waste of time every week.
You don't do anything here.
Why don't you practise?
Such a distance... a waste of time.
When I wanted to take piano lessons:
No I won't allow that!
"It was a question of whether I would go to the conservatory, or go on to study something else."
Dad said:
No!
"That was after the First World War, when Russian aristocrats were playing in bars."
He didn't want to allow that.
He didn't believe I'd be a pianist.
While everyone else said I could make a career.
And what's the result?
"You're an ordinary teacher, just scraping a living."
Now I'm happy I'm a teacher.
I like doing it. I enjoy it.
"But before I got to it, the things I had to give up..."
During the Protectorate I used to play in an orchestra.
I counted on going to study after the war.
My dream was some embassy.
I wanted to see the world.
And that was all I could afford.
The Protectorate put a stop to that.
"At grammar school the girls used to tell me, what are you worrying about!"
You'll make a career as an actress.
"For example, Ji?"
"¨ª Krej¨¨¨ªk, who went into films, said:"
One day I'll make a feature film.
You'll play the second main role.
I did it quick.
And it's exciting and it pops and I get the sense that Dave likes it.
I'm going back to the bar.
I don't know what New Orleans music would be today if it wouldn't be for what the Meters created back in the day.
The Meters are like the Beatles here in New Orleans for us.
I think the Meters turned out to be is the embodiment of everything we're sitting here talking about.
They're just straight-up New Orleans funk.
Leo Nocentelli on guitar.
Zigaboo Modeliste on drums.
"And the bass player, George Porter."
The Neville Brothers were Art and Aaron.
They were like a part of the fiber of the early days of the Meters.
I discovered the Meters through Led Zeppelin.
I read somewhere that the Meters were...
"John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin..."
They were one of his favorite bands.
"And it only makes sense... when you listen to the ""pocket"""
and the groove the Meters had.
"I was fascinated with Zigaboo, the drummer."
"It's such a strange, unorthodox, different way of approaching rhythm."
I never heard it before.
He was very syncopated.
"He used the ""ands"" of ""one"""
way more than normal drummers would use.
"And when he makes them, I would read him."
You know?
"I'd know it's coming, so I would ""and"" with him, you know?"
"It wasn't ""correct,"" they way he played."
It was just how he felt.
He played how he felt.
It's just the artistic air around New Orleans.
"It's like a gas that's leaking out, and everybody is, you know..."
I don't need a lawyer.
I answered all the questions.
I think I've got a headache.
I wish you'd go away.
[groans]
Mom.
I don't know what got into that police officer... but don't be upset.
Everybody knows you had nothing to do with it.
Do you still want me to sit for you at the Blakes tonight?
Are you sure you're gonna be all right here alone?
"I'll be back as early as I can, Mom."
[door closes]
(Lottie) Dear Mr. Nash... the time has come when I need you.
I'm all mixed up... especially after what happened the night of the murder.
I like to keep myself busy when I'm baby-sitting.
Makes the time go by quicker.
"It was a good book, very romantic."
I couldn't wait to find out what happened.
So after I finished the book I looked around for something else to do.
You've no idea how empty the life of a baby-sitter is.
And how quiet.
It's not as if I were a teenager... with lots of friends to keep me company.
Bobby was sound asleep.
Such an angel.
And with a mother like that.
"But again, you're his father."
"I guess it takes two to tango, if you get what I mean."
That woman sure was some housekeeper.
Never saw such a mess.
"But then, I guess she didn't have time for such things."
"Dust, just like I expected."
It was funny seeing the two of us hanging there.
"In a bar, in a hotel lobby, on a street corner..."
Or in my home?
I'm not going to let you make anything dirty out of this!
Then what do you call it?
I'm going to tell you a hard truth about yourself.
It isn't sex your afraid of.
It's love that you can't handle.
"And that's what you're offering me, with your hands all over me?"
"That's only one expression of it, backed up by many things."
I haven't asked for any of them.
You'd better understand what you're saying no to.
"When I take you in my arms, I'm committing myself to you all the way!"
"That means that I intend to worry about you, take care of you... and that's what I want back from you!"
"Without any reservations, or shame, or embarrassment!"
-Either you're up to that or not!
-I have my standards and my pride.
-Not enough.
"-You need someone to trust, to love."
"-No, I don't."
I don't!
-Just leave me alone.
"-I can, but I don't want to."
"Connie, let me help you."
I don't care if you hang back.
"If it takes time, I'll give all you need."
I can't!
The offer is always open.
I don't know if you'll take it up but... perhaps it will make you feel better knowing it's there.
Hello?
"Yes, Marion."
I don't believe it!
Are you positive?
Temu!
Mouna!
"Mouna, he's one of our own"
"No one can ever run ahead of me, you hear?"
"Come on, Labay!"
Are you alright?
Laying railway tracks?
It's no easy task in the mountains
In order to harvest the natural resources in those forests we need to have proper transportation
Yeah
It's a shame to leave those resources undeveloped but those savages up there...
Sir?
"Here she is, sir"
"She dares not lead you past Hakaw Supeitei, Captain"
She'll spend the night in her father's house in Meisi
She won't accompany you to the hunting grounds of other clans
Much obliged
Let's go!
Captain?
Those savages in the mountains are rather ferocious
Please be careful!
Hey!
"Hey, it's your turn now"
Wow!
How beautiful!
"Yes, indeed"
It was so dark last night that we didn't notice we're surrounded by cherry blossom trees
Cherry blossoms?
They really are cherry blossoms
It's so red
Red as blood
Blockade the entire Wushe region
- right. hmm.
"well, it's been a pleasure."
- oh. thank you.
"so, we cool here?"
"- based on my evaluation, you don't meet the minimum requirements for the department of child care."
- what?
what does that mean?
- we'll be in touch.
- let me see that.
- that is confidential!
- you still got to take me to town.
"- no, i can't go dressed like this. get in there."
[car engine turns over]
"- cindy, what are you doing here?"
"- don't you ""cindy"" me, you back-stabbing son of a bitch!"
- language!
"- or was it you, marge?"
- what is this all about?
- what's this all about?
!
your lard of a wife called the government people on me to take my kids away!
"- i am big-boned, and that is the way god made me."
- marjorie?
- i was doing my civic duty.
"- the kids could use a little more stability, cind."
- oh.
what kind of a person doesn't want their own mother to be with their kids?
!
"- cindy, you don't deserve those kids."
you need to take a good long look at yourself.
you rely on everybody to do things for you.
"you know, your kids don't even expect christmas presents this year from you because they know that, if you had one cent, you'd spend it on yourself, or you'd put it in some stupid scheme that doesn't pay off."
What are the windows at the back?
What's that?
I think those are dressing rooms.
"If these are the dressing rooms, these other windows are at the front."
That's gotta be the apartment where Reardon sleeps.
Could be.
This is good.
You still need some of my guys?
"No, I got a few of my own crew up here, now."
I'll be in touch when I need you.
You know this man?
That's Gordon Evans.
He's a president at my bank.
And this man?
No.
"George Browne, President of the Blackmire Group."
Evans tells me we're gonna be washing money for him.
So I understand.
I'm gonna want records of those transactions.
- Should be able to get those.
- I have another question.
"You're still getting out of the weed business, right?"
"- I'm trying hard, yeah."
- We've concerns about how that might affect the level of violence in the trade.
"Well, we'd like to see a smooth transition happen here."
We can't afford to see a whole new crop of players move in and set up shop.
We just... don't have the resources to stay on top of it.
Are you trying to tell me who I should sell to?
I'd like to have some input.
What works for you?
"Well, if you sold to Dante and the Vietnamese, 50-50... probably keep things more or less stabilised."
"Probably, but I don't know if that's gonna work."
(Clinks and whooshes)
(Cheering and laughing)
What are we gonna do now?
I'll think of something.
- What's funny?
- Russ didn't tell you?
"He told me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
- He didn't tell you about Pete?
"- No, who's Pete?"
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible cause he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
- What did he do?
- He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe, because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while he hear a voice inside that said: ""Pete, don't worry about it."""
You weren't the first licensed practitioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then, just when he almost over the guilt with it all, another voice would bring him back down to reality."
"And say: ""Oh Pete,"
But dude...
"You're a Veterinarian."""
Vi!
Let's go!
Wha..
What are you doing?
- I don't get it.
- Don't get what?
What's so funny about a vegetarian man?
I don't get it.
Can we ask you a question?
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
We must have made a mistake somewhere.
"Look, just between us,"
-what do you think of them?
-So I should give my opinion?
"No, don't worry."
"I'm telling you ""just between us""."
I'm supposed to give my opinion between us?
-I will not give it.
-And why not?
"I will give my opinion, and you will broadcast it, and who will have problems?"
Me.
Do I want problems?
No.
If you want problems then give your opinion.
"What, me?"
!
I'm only an ordinary substrate.
"Excuse me, how would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?"
Now I don't know what I would say.
"I'm thinking about something else, I don't perceive you."
"Well, I don't know."
Everyone whould be wondering and would be curious how it would work out.
For sure they would be wondering too.
"It's an interesting question, but I don't know."
That question has been put strangely.
Depending on whether they have the antennae or they speak with a dictaphone.
-Do they seem normal to you?
-Normal?
-Definitely not.
-Really?
So I don't have to send him down the mines quite yet?
"Um, I'm sorry, I think that might be my next appointment."
"No, that is your previous one."
That's Fuzz's dad who's just successfully missed every other parent-teacher interview.
"Cleaver, this is Fiona McCready, Fuzz's English teacher."
Hi.
Sorry.
Caught up in a very complex trial.
"Oh, was the complex trial run over five or eight furlongs?"
Finnegan mentioned you were a barrister.
I think he wants to follow in your footsteps.
"According to all the other teachers, he is."
"What is an education, anyway?"
I spent most of 1982 learning 52.8% of Malaysia's GDP came from rubber.
I don't even know if they produce the stuff anymore.
"He's a bright boy, he's falling behind."
Why?
"Because he doesn't sit up straight in class and say,"
"'Miss, Miss, ask me!"
'
You know what happens to kids who do that.
"Yes, they're in an office somewhere with their hand up still."
"Anyway, that last teacher seemed quite impressed."
"Yes, she did."
Yeah.
Never had a teacher who looked like that.
I did once see Miss Treadwell in her bathers.
Her varicose veins looked like an aerial shot of the Nile Delta.
(Laughs)
Is there a word that means even shallower than superficial?
Are you still screwing Scarlet?
I knew it was a mistake telling you.
"What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?"
I don't know.
What about Mendenhour?
"If it was me, I'd say it wasn't much of a shot."
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50 instead of that.45-.60?
"Those old buffalo guns carry better, but with a.45-.60... you can get rounds at any general store."
Keeps a drygulcher in business.
"Tom, on the killing of this kid..."
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?
Two hundred thirteen yards.
What do you know about that?
What I just told you.
"You afraid of dying, Joe?"
"Yes, I am."
I am afraid of losing my ability to be able to come and go as I please.
Lose my freedom.
Not be able to get back up in those hills again.
What would they do to a man... that killed a 15-year-old boy with a Winchester?
I believe that man would have to die.
And you believe that a.45-.60 that's got a trajectory like a rainbow... could make that shot?
I know it could happen.
If I'd have killed that kid... it would have been the best shot I ever made... and the dirtiest trick I ever done.
"Hello, Sam."
I'm going to have to arrest you for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.
"Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?"
What are you going to do with that Winchester?
"We're just going to have to find out, ain't we?"
"Yeah, I guess we are."
"I'll take that rifle, Tom."
"Hello, Earl."
And the belly gun.
"Pint of lager, please."
Something local.
- Thank you.
- GLEN:
All right.
"So, a local lager for Mr. Brando and a Caesar for Sandy Bullock."
I love those orders.
Be right back.
I didn't think they'd have it at Four Dancers.
"Yes, I didn't think they'd have it at this resto-bar."
- Gastro-pub.
"- Says ""resto-bar"" on the sign."
It's more of a micro-bistro.
"Says brasserie on the menu right there, too."
It's more of a bistro-brasserie.
When I came in they asked me if I wanted to sit at the resto-bar or the gastro-lounge.
I'm glad you chose the resto-bar.
This is actually the gastro-lounge.
"Do you know what an emergency call is, Wayne?"
- Negative.
"- It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust."
"And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date."
"Well, that's fair."
I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here.
A good one.
And you shouldn't be afraid of it.
I think we could do good things here.
"I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, Wayne."
- Okay.
- Let's really talk about them.
- Okay.
"- I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them."
we've to reexamine all evidence.

- You cannot break the Internet.
- Um.
"He was scared at first, a little panicky."
"He paced, slugged away at the form, swore a lot, but once he figured out his way back to the home page, there was no stopping him."
He was surfing the Internet like a 17-year-old.
"- So, what did you think?"
"- Worst form in the world, pain in the ass,"
- but it took me places.
"- In the end, the form itself became a personalized website, a profile page full of photos, life experiences, and friends."
"The senior volunteers were scared at first, but they all booked repeat sessions."
They loved that they had a place on the Internet.
Thank you.
- When will you come to Halifax?
- Oh.
You need a bigger team.
My office in Hamilton
"- serves 81,000 seniors."
- Oh.
"This is your whole life now, you realize that?"
Would the same thing work on kids?
I mean really young kids.
"Uh, would you just excuse me?"
"Mr. Renn, what are you doing here?"
"I came to see your presentation, of course."
It was excellent.
"- It's wonderful to see you, Mr. Renn."
- We're all very proud of you.
You had such poise up there.
"When you were working with us,"
I was worried about you.
You had your anxiety issues.
But look at this!
[slam] [phone rings]
Hello.
"Oh, Paul."
How's the party?
It died.
So did the hostess.
What do you mean?
"Well, somebody stole the family jewels after all and slipped a knife into Mrs. Langley at the same time."
"Perry, could you come over right away?"
"My responsibility here is to the niece Merle, and the way things are shaping up, the poor kid's going to need help fast."
What kind of help?
"Well, right now, the case depends on who's got those diamonds, which is like looking for a needle in a haystack because this place is enormous."
But there's one place the police haven't looked--
Merle's luggage.
Why not?
They can't find the keys.
"Paul, do you have the keys?"
You guessed it.
Merle slipped them to me with a pleading look.
"Perry, I'd appreciate it if you were here when Lieutenant Anderson forces the locks."
"Okay, Sergeant, thank you very much."
"All right, no one left the party early."
No one has those diamonds in their possession.
So we're starting to search the grounds now and that other house across the way.
Without a search warrant?
"We didn't think you'd mind, Mr. Kirk."
"No, no."
Anytime.
"But in the meantime, this luggage."
"Miss Telford, have you remembered yet what you did with the keys?"
"I lost them, I told you."
Then I'm afraid we'll have to force the--
- Very well
"""This is the first time it's happening in 18 years"""
"""Some stranger I have never seen, comes to my mind..."""
"""shadow-like before my eyes"""
"""Someone raps on my heart"""
"""Deep eyes want me to give myself up"""
"""When I look at my hands, there I see a face etched"""
"""A silken breath brushes my cheeks"""
"""My hair still smells of the o dour on his hands"""
"""Yes, it's happening for the first time in 18 years"""
"""I've never seen this stranger who comes to my mind"""
"Simi, you've begun writing quite well... and the boy seems lively."
Who's he?
"Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him"
So there's no one?
I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays
And you dream of someone you haven't even seen!
Quite mad
No Ma.
This is no dream
"I may not have met him, seen him."
But he's there.
"Out there, somewhere"
"""The one who comes in my dreams..."""
"""the one who teases me..."""

Who is he?

To save the historic Estabul from Roland...
I don't care what happens to the kingdom!
The people come first!
Will this really make the people happy?
Isn't it just excessive bloodshed?
I'll be satisfied if the people can live happily.
"Aren't you the one who taught me that, Salawell?"
"Right now, our forces are still strong."
So Roland won't get too brazen.
But there's no guarantee of that in the future.
"I've heard terrible rumors about Roland nobility, too."
"If you truly want to consider the people, now is the time."
"If you speak thus, it must be so."
"For you, we would not shrink even from death."
"I want to make a kingdom where everyone can live with a smile, where everyone can be happy!"
"Can I do it, Salawell?"
Of course you can!
We shall henceforth do battle with Roland!
We shall take back Estabul's independence ourselves!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
I bear a message from Rear Admiral Klom!
The battle has commenced!
"Shuss, what are the enemy numbers?"
Roughly eight to nine thousand.
Exactly as Froaude's information claimed.
- I don't like it.
- Sir?
Nothing.
We'll end this with minimal casualties.
Let's go!
"All forces, advance!"
"""Totally fine."
"""I just don't know what you're doing."
"Can't really read it."""
"And then years went by, and she goes,"
"""You know what, you do you."
"""I'll just adopt some grandkids."
"I don't care anymore."""
But it's good.
"My relationship with my mom is getting stronger, which is really cool."
"I figured that, as I got older, my relationship with her would be more adult-to-adult."
"But what's happening is, I'm becoming an adult, and she's becoming a teenager."
Is that happening to anybody else?
[applause]
It's so strange.
"She keeps doing and saying things that she thinks are really cool, but they just weird me out."
"We were talking about weed recently, because my brother's going to art school in Colorado."
So...
He's minoring in weed.
"And she goes, ""I don't know"
"""why he had to go all the way to Colorado for weed."
"I can get weed whenever I want."""
"And I was like, ""You can get weed whenever you want?"
"Do you have a dealer?"""
"And she goes, ""No, it's in my room."""
"Which is not ""getting"" weed."
That's having weed.
"And I was like, ""Okay."""
And she was so proud of it.
"She's like, ""Yeah, I can smoke anytime I want."""
"And I was like, ""Cool,"""
and then changed the subject very quickly.
"I think that may have been an invitation for us to smoke together, but I didn't want to take it, because I smoke and drink to escape my life stressors."
I can do it right now.
Chakotay to Paris.
Is the rescue team ready?
Standing by.
Prepare for transport.
"Deflector ready, Commander."
Initiate the radion beams.
Sending out the first volley... Is working.
They're getting through the shields.
Begin the transport.
"Transporter Room 2, synchronize your confinement beams to..."
That came from the surface.
Maximum shields.
Damage report.
Shields at 90 percent.
That was a precision hit right to the source of the beams.
Main deflector is now off-line.
We're being hailed from the surface.
On screen.
Your attempt to penetrate our defenses is a hostile act against the Mokra Order.
There are now 85 phased- ion cannons targeted at your ship.
"If you don't withdraw from Mokra space in two minutes, we will open fire."
Commander.
"Give me some good news, Mr. Kim."
There's a disruption in the shields around the prison.
That qualifies.
Good work.
"I wish I could take credit for it, butit's coming from inside the prison."
Can we get through?
"Yes, but the Mokra will detect our transport."
Sounds like they have other things to worry about right now.
That disruption might not be accidental.
"I love you, Margaret, but this is my life."
I'll decide what to do with it.
"You're lucky to have my sister for your wife, Lowell, and you be good to her."
I'll be watching very closely.
"There is no prince, Aunt Imogene."
You need to talk to someone about these delusions.
"I happen to love rabbits, especially white ones."
"Don't worry, Mother,"
I'll find something useful to do with my life.
You two remind me of some funny boys I met in a dream.
-You've left me out.
"-No, I haven't, sir."
You and I have business to discuss.
Shall we speak in the study?
Oh.
And one more thing.
(ALL GASPING)
"My father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo, but I don't think he was looking far enough."
Why not go all the way to China?
"It's vast, the culture is rich, and we have a foothold in Hong Kong."
"To be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?"
"You know, if anybody else had said that to me,"
"I'd say, ""You've lost your senses."""
But I've seen that look before.
"Well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law, perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company."
"Hello, Absolem."
( ALICE PLAYING)
"Tripping out, spinning around"
I'm underground I fell down
"Yeah, I fell down"
I'm freaking out Where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
I brought you some company.
"Oh, he might be a little disoriented, after the way he came out of stasis."
- I know you.
"- Oh, you remember her?"
"Well, his mind isn't fully gone."
Hey!
Stay away from him!
I'm going to kill you.
"You've had 4,000 years to do so, with no success."
What are you doing?
Your blood is the key to unlocking the Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave the three of us our powers.
They sent three meteorites containing technology beyond human understanding.
"When they are activated by your blood,"
"I will be able to erase time itself, and travel us back to 1700 B.C."
- No.
No!
"- I will begin my immortal life anew, only this time"
I won't be content to whisper in the ears of powerful men.
This time I will be the one with the power.
I will be a god.
Please try very hard not to kill me.
Rip.
Please take me back.
I need your help.
I need to save my sister.
"And you know that I would do this for you, Sara, but I just can't."
I've not asked you for anything.
And you of all people should understand.
You have tried everything.
We... we have tried everything
"On his earlier weekend visit, musician Mr. Carrington touched a chord with Miss Hopkins."
"When Mr. Carrington came for the weekend, it was like a breath of fresh air walking into this house."
"Something just kind of clicked inside me, and, um... and, uh..."
"The hostess's companion, Miss Martin, is helping Miss Hopkins make a love token to greet Mr. Carrington."
This looks wicked great.
"Chaperone Mrs. Hammond is so thrilled at the prospect of having an attractive musician back at the house, she's hired a grand piano."
This is just what we needed.
Perfect.
Music has ever been a conduit for amour.
But a Regency musician only had the social advantages of a senior servant... hardly a suitable candidate for Miss Hopkins.
I've just spilt yellow paint everywhere.
Does it hide it?
"Ah, that's really, really nice."
Nice.
"Ladies, gentlemen."
Oh!
"Well, that's a proper piano."
"Oh, that's so good."
"Anyway, come on, come and have a drink and then sort of settle in."
Thank you so much.
That's so amazing.
I can't believe it.
"""Here's a little something from me to you"
"""to welcome you back to Kentchurch Court."
"""It's good to have you back, mate."
"Fondest regards, Miss Hopkins."""
Look at this tambourine she's done.
That is so amazing.
"""Follow the beat of your heart."""
"God, I'm really getting blown away today."
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
- Your wedding?
- I'm engaged to be married.
We haven't announced it yet.
Father said it was an awful comedown for an earl's daughter to marry a mere baronet.
He was joking of course.
He didn't care about things like that.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Lady Carnarvon.
The carriages are ready.
Goodbye.
This is for you.
It's the terms of the concession.
My husband was very keen that you continue with your work.
"He agreed with the government that you remain in charge of the clearance of the tomb, no matter whether it remain intact or not."
- I won't let him down.
- No.
"- Goodbye, Howard."
- Goodbye.
MACE:
I think we're going to have to lift this frame up a couple of feet to get the right angle of leverage.
"Ali, Ali, can you give me the rope?"
- How's it going?
- Good.
"If you're looking at the damage, don't blame us."
They must have just banged it into position.
They don't seem to have taken much care.
It took us 12 hours to get the last one out.
We should be able to restore it.
When are you going to be ready in there?
I don't know.
There's a crack across the lid.
If they hope to continue Their hunt at sledge.
Rock and rock And rock and rock.
"If you don't find any gold,"
You can't call yourself a Miner.
"So if I can't find Anything new,"
Then there's no reason To keep doing this.
125 miles east...
Right now it's gonna tell us Whether we've wasted our time.
Or if we've made a good Decision And we're gonna get rich.
Fuel is back in the air pump.
And shawn is ready once more...
To hunt for elusive gold At the bluff.
I got a reputation to uphold.
"I come out here and fail, I'm gonna look like a fool."
I don't like failing.
Each expedition At the bluff costs thousands.
"And if shawn fails again,"
His plan for the empire Will be on it's last leg.
I'm here because I have a feeling.
That there's a lot of gold Here.
I just have a feeling.
My gut tells me That I'm gonna find.
Some nice big chunks Of gold today.
"I mean, I've been to the bluff Multiple times and failed."
"But every time you go back,"
You're hoping You're gonna succeed.
You got to always stay Positive.
"Ooh, here we go."
Do or die.
Here we go.
"I think we're gonna find Something really,"
Really good down here.

- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
"- You got to something to say, son?"
We're all ears.
"This being your first week,"
"I'm gonna cut you some slack, all right?"
"'Cause, son, you got it easy on this side of the fence."
Do you understand?
"You get to go home at night, sleep in your warm, snuggly bed."
"But you best start giving a damn, or else you'll wind up over there, in juvie, playing with the big boys."
And you sure as hell ain't going home to your mommy and daddy.
"You will be locked up, crying and pissing yourself to sleep every night."
On the ground.
Give me 50.

"Living in southeast Texas, it's important we get prepared, because hurricane season is here."
What will the next one bring?
"It's not a matter of ""if"" but ""when."""
- Come on.
Let's go.
Get in your bed.
Okay.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
Yes.
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero."
"Your Honor, I have a document..."
"See, the hardest thing was leaving the life."
I still love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
"We had it all, just for the asking."
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive.
Isn't that right?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about being a rat.
"Objection, Your Honor."
In view of the violence...
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
"I'd bet $20.000, $30.000 over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies."
It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
That's why we came after you.
That's lucky for me.
He had no intention of leaving me alive.
- You get a good look at him?
- Yeah.
"Asian, mid-40s, he had a tattoo on the side of his head."
Sounds like the picture of the guy out of New York.
What picture?
Akira Kimura.
Who is he?
Yeah.
That's the same guy.
Akira Kimura.
He was somehow connected to my case on Roth and Flynn.
The guys who came for the coins.
Yeah.
God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around.
"And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue."
"It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army."
It went underground after the Japanese defeat in world war ii.
But it appears the organization has resurfaced with ties to the Yakuza.
"We got a report that Kimura was identified by state police in hamburg, Germany, three months a, now he's here."
I want you to tear this town apart and find this son of a bitch.
We think he hired a private investigator out of New York.
We found photos of you.
"And me, Hank, the captain, everybody on this investigator's camera."
The same investigator we found dead today.
We think Kimura killed him.
Why would he kill the guy he hired?
Remember those coins I was telling you about?
"Oh, yeah."
Everybody died?
We'll have our own religion in our own building.
"Oh, this does not seem very attainable."
"You should set your sights a little bit smaller, like"
- A new shoe cubby for the mosque.
"- Yeah, I'm with Baber,"
"But to be fair, I don't really care."
"I thank you for your honesty, Rev. Baber, you have wanted this for years."
I just don't think now is a good time.
People will think we're up to no good.
- Why?
"- People will see the minarets and think,"
"- ""Uh-oh, Muslims!"""
- Naturally.
"And then, they'll see innocent old Baber buying some lawn fertilizer and blamo!"
They'll think we're going to blow something up.
Why would they think that?
And why would you be buying fertilizer?
Your lawn is full of weeds and crabgrass.
"Well, that's exactly why I would be buying fertilizer."
My point is proven.
Point not proven!
No one's even going to think you're capable of blowing anything up!
Challenge accepted!
You will see the authorities will be right at my door!
- AMAAR:
"Salaam alaikum, Sarah."
"- Hi, Amaar."
- You wanted to talk to me?
"- Yeah, I needed your help with a presentation tonight at the town meeting for the new mosque."
"Look, Amaar, I would love to help..."
"Great, I will get you the plans right away."
"No, no, no."
STEVE:
"Oh, of cour..."
"I'm sorry, right."
So somebody else killed him and you covered it up?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's the truth.
Is it?
We didn't want anyone connecting Cutler back to us.
"So, yes, we covered it up."
"Look, Cutler was feeding us good intel."
There was... there was no reason to kill him.
"In fact, we tried to save him."
What?
What are you talking about?
He called us for help right after he'd been shot.
"And-and I can prove that, too."
We had a burner phone that we kept in touch with him...
We know about the phone.
What happened next?
We sent a medic.
"But by the time he got there,"
Cutler had been dead for a while.
"After that, we were just, you know, worried about controlling the situation."
Damage control.
"Well, maybe you ought to start worrying about your legal defense, because right now you're looking at obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact."
Okay.
"Yeah, you got me dead to rights."
But... maybe... we could help each other out.
How do you figure?
"Well, what if I were to say that, um... in the course of cleaning the crime scene, my people... may have gathered evidence."
Evidence that could help you catch whoever killed Cutler.
(sighs) What a mess.
That's right.
Spotters never raise the bet or play any kind of progressive system.
"That's how we stay under the radar, and that's why we never get caught."
Exactly.
"Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min, and they're keeping the count waiting for one of these decks to get hot."
Right.
"And then when one of the decks gets hot, the spotter at that table signals in the big player."
This...
Mustard.
"Give me the mustard, honey."
Please.
"Well, I'm always the mustard, so..."
"When I get the signal for the hot deck, I stumble over like some drunk rich kid, or some zoned out dot-com millionaire, and I throw down big money."
So the big player bets big and still keeps the count.
"When the deck cools, he cashes in."
It's not as easy as it sounds.
"Oh, yeah, it's not, you know, because if Grey Poupon over here ever loses the count, it's up to his table's spotter to give him the signal to get out."
"- And you know the signals, right?"
- Yeah.
Show us.
"Okay, what's this?"
- The deck's hot.
- Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out.
Get out now.
Good.
I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
- Where?
- You'll find out.
"It's a funny thing to sell your soul for, a new Beamer."
"Yeah, cars have never really done it for me."
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
One that you gave the full VIP treatment to.
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could've hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
- Do you mind if I ask why?
- He'd been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
Best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
"Fishing rods, little ones."
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
"Also, I don't like fire-eaters."
I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"You wouldn't just let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
- All right.
All right.
"Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?"
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive.
That's really good.
"I mean, I'm very impressed by that, especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations."
"All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know."
Anyone?
Bueller.
Anyone?
Bueller.
Newton stole it.
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
"And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails."
"- I'm sorry, what's your name?"
- Ben.
Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson was the original author of this method.
"Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?"
"Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist."
"And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna."
"All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?"
"We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?"
"Ben, suppose you're on a game show."
"And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?"
"Now, behind one of the doors is a new car."
"Behind the other two, goats."
"Which door would you choose, Ben?"
"You know, I didn't even think about her."
"God, what if...?"
I wonder if she even knows.
"Not exactly a normal couple night out, huh?"
It was surprisingly normal considering how blindsided you were.
You want something to drink?
"Yes, please."
I think I have to just sit.
And not move.
"If I do, who knows what else is going to come along and rip my life apart."
- You're right.
- Thank you.
Let's not move.
It's too big a risk.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Why do anything?
"Well, eventually I'm going to have to get up."
"The thing is, everybody keeps telling me that I have this sister."
I don't know what the hell that means.
"I mean, when I think of Sarah, I don't think of her DNA."
I think about how we grew up together in the same house with the same weird family.
"And how we, you know, shared our diaries and our shampoos."
But am I supposed to have those same feelings
- for a woman that I never even met?
- I don't think anybody expects that.
"Well, and then there's my dad."
I've been grieving for a father that I don't even know.
And I was just starting to get all... happy.
I wouldn't let this destroy that.
You hold on to what's good.
To what makes you happy.
You make me happy.
I like a man who can answer his own questions.
Saves me from stating the obvious.
Look after her.
- Hmm.
Fresh straw and everything.
You think he's joking.
Have you spoken to him?
"- If this is what he wants, we can't stop him."
You forgotten how old he is?
- I was a year younger.
"If you were my son, I'd have stopped you."
You wouldn't have had the option.
"Young men are drawn to war like moths to flame, Mim."
It's their chance to prove themselves.
Or be blown to pieces trying.
From a bullet or regret - more than one way to die.
"Spare me the glory of the battlefield, Bryn."
It took us years to get through it.
You still can't pour a jug with a steady hand.
"That said, I'd sooner have gone than not."
David isn't ready.
- No-one is.
You're not listening.
It's not a choice.
Not for most.
"Well, now your precious Institute's closed, perhaps I'll have your full attention."
"You've always had my full attention, Bob."
"- No, no."
Your mind is frequently elsewhere when it should be focused on ensuring that the only breadwinner in the house is looked after.
"But if you'd allow me to work,"
I could alleviate some of the financial worry.
We've had this conversation.
"That and the V.A. records, yes."
Do you mind passing this on to the judge?
--based on only one interview?
"The defendant has a lengthy, documented case--"
Please answer the question.
-Would you restate the question?
-All right.
"Based on that one interview, you were able--?"
Where are you going with this?
"Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant V.A. record one way..."
... ourpsychologist interprets it another.
Another and another until the end of time.
So much for expert witnesses.
Let's take a break.
2:30 all right for everybody?
"I see you've already met Peter Ragan, my law clerk."
He's written some of my best opinions.
He appeared before me first time I presided over moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
25 miles west of nome.
Off sledge island...
"- hey, zeke, you copy?"
"- Yes, I copy."
I'm gonna crawl down The hose here.
"After narrowly Escaping the bends,"
"Zeke tenhoff is Down under once again,"
This time in shallower waters.
It would be really encouraging.
Just to see one little Micro flyspeck of gold.
It's been a while Since I've seen one.
But the team is still Coming up empty handed.
I don't want to think Of what's gonna happen.
If we don't succeed In making money at all.
This is really Our very last chance.
To make a future for ourselves.
What is this place?
Good god.
"I can see some rocks down here,"
A lot of big old boulders.
"Well, um, I mean I think we Just have to keep looking, man."
"Well, um, looks like there's Some pockets of gravel."
In between some of these rocks I haven't tried dredging on.
Where is the gold?
I miss gold so much.
I didn't realize how Emotionally Dependent I am on gold.
Kind of does look like It might be bedrock.
So it's a bunch of boulders On top of bedrock.
"If there's gold here, We're just gonna have to."
Keep hunting around Everywhere to find it.
"You know, I think I just want to lift up."
"One of these boulders and see Maybe underneath the boulder,"
INTERVIEWER:
So what are you looking over here?
"It's a short-term, I believe, contract-- 21 days."
And it looks in order.
But I'm gonna read it just to be sure.
Make sure I don't have to give up my first-born
Or something like that.
INTERVIEWER:
And what will that be for?
"I'm gonna be Toxie's double whenever they need it, I guess."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yo, you're supposed to stop"
People from going up here.
"You see, if they fall down, break their neck with babies."
So stop them from going through.
[Chatter]
We're gonna have a little problem
"Today, because people are going to be going up that step."
We're shooting now.
"If somebody goes up the steps when the cameras are rolling,"
"That's very bad, because it means we waste film."
Yeah.
"Because you know what'll happen,"
"They'll look at the camera behind them,"
And then that screws it up.
Because then people know that they aren't
Supposed to be in the movie.
"So have to make sure that the pedestrians, very politely,"
"Are told to go around the back, that we're making a movie,"
That we're going around the back.
"I don't want women with tiny babies coming through here,"
"Tripping over wires, bumping into people."
Ha-ha-ha!
At long last.
The Torch of Truth.
I...
I don't understand.
I knew this was a waste of time.
But the Torch must be in here.
"It isn't, because it never existed."
"The Torch is a myth, like Atlantis."
But the medallion did open the Ark.
"If that much of the legend is true, maybe the rest is too."
"Look, if I could take the Ark to Thera and solve the riddle of Solon, uh, I know that I could prove that the ruined city there was Atlantis and find the treasure."
You and MacGyver caused enough trouble on Thera five years ago.
"Simon, you told me the best tool an archaeologist has is an open mind."
I won't have my work disrupted again by Atticus and his idiotic notions about a super-civilization.
"Simon, you are still a blinkered old fool!"
I have no time for this.
I have a plane to catch back to Greece.
"Come along, Kelly,"
I'll give you a ride to the university.
"I'm not going back there, Simon."
What are you saying?
I've decided I'd like to stay here and work with Atticus and MacGyver.
"Kelly, you're a scholar, girl, not a treasure hunter."
"All my life, I've done what you want."
I'm quite capable of making up my own mind.
"First you and MacGyver disrupted my work on Thera, and now you've poisoned my granddaughter's mind."
No.
It's my decision.
Fine.
Go ahead.
"Throw away your academic career, if you want."
That's your third strike...
before you're 25 years old.
That makes you the goddamn rookie of the year.
I got a little baby at home.
"She need milk and books, man."
Only thing you got at home... is a wide-screen TV you haven't paid for yet!
–Ow!
–Here's your statement.
Sign it.
"Whoa, man."
"What the hell is this, man?"
This is all filled out.
You don't wanna sign?
I'll throw you in County right now on that third strike.
And if I sign this bullshit confession?
"Play ball with us, we'll let you play extra innings."
We know you've been selling stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.
"Give us a hand, we'll lose this statement."
We'll forget we ever saw you.
Man!
"Oh, my God."
Why would someone do this to her?
Most likely trying to fill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.
Why would someone fantasize about cutting a woman's arm off?
"Some people derive sexual pleasure... through inflicting physical, emotional abuse."
That's horrible.
"Yes, it is."
How old were you when you met Bob?
–Is he your first boyfriend?
–How did you know?
"He made you feel powerful, right?"
Did he tell you about the attempted kidnapping charges filed against him?
My guards will take you south of here
"To a ship set for the southern coast of Spain,"
"And from there, you should keep going."
You needed to vanish
Because you would have been a displaced king.
But I'm just a bastard.
"In time,"
"A very short time, if you'd accepted my presence,"
"The nobles would, too, and I'd be safe."
If you were so inclined.
I'm not so inclined.
"Well, there it is..."
The truth between us at last.
"Make sure what's between us, brother, is distance."
If you want to survive.
Marie:
"So, we'll do another ceremony for you"
"At notre dame, so that all of France"
Can celebrate your marriage.
And what of queen catherine?
She's been pardoned for her adultery?
Yes.
It was all to legitimize bash.
"Now henry looks benevolent, forgiving."
Your father gave me these.
Make some heirs quick as you can.
"It's a queen's sons that give her power after all,"
Though we've handled
"The misfortune of your sex, haven't we?"
Brave girls are we.
Greer said you were upset.
"I came to your room last night to cheer you with hot cocoa,"
"Mr. Moreau, what should I do with the Atomium?"
Ludovic!
Wallonia declared its independence!
Belgium fell apart!
"Their declaration reads, ""We are fed up."""
With what?
The Flemish are arrogant.
They humiliate the Walloons and don't understand them.
They are fed up.
We have to go back immediately.
It'll take us 90 minutes to get to the airport.
Hello!
"Please, come again."
"No, His Majesty wants to talk to the Prime Minister of Wallonia."
- Ludovic?
- There is no signal.
What about the speech?
I will take care of it before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
I will write it myself.
"But we have to discuss all the political and diplomatic aspects with the chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, and there is no signal."
"With federal ministers as well,"
I don't remember who exactly.
"Sire, we have to be very careful about every word and every move."
Prudence is key.
"At the coronation, the king swore to preserve the integrity of his kingdom at all times."
And I am the king.
Unity means strength.
Unity secures power.
I'll add that.
"Some people have foresight, some have a dream."
"Sire, what is your intuition tells you?"
- Enough for all the ladies who do high tea at the Bel-Air.
"Yeah, I remember my first campaign."
I didn't care about image.
I would show up at a fundraiser in the same suit that I wore to the previous night's fundraiser.
"Sometimes my wife and I would bring the kids,"
- strapped to us in those backpacks.
- Sounds like fun.
"No, it was, and then we'd rush home, put the kids to bed and then stay up all night laughing about the evening."
Sounds like you and your wife made a good team.
Ex-wife.
"And, yeah, we did."
For a while.
Do you miss her?
I miss the people we were back then.
"And no, I don't miss who she is now."
And I know she doesn't miss who I've become.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language' Ha'

"Good work, Mr. Kim."
"Mr. Neelix, you're with me."
I thinkit's time we contact the Mokra.
"Mr. Paris, set a new course."
Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet... slowly.
We don't want to look aggressive.
"Yes, sir."
What kind of response should we expect when they see us?
The Mokra are paranoid and hostile.
They have little use for diplomacy.
I wouldn't be surprised if they started shooting at us immediately.
We'll be in full view of the planet in a few seconds.
Their orbital sensor net has picked us up.
They're scanning the ship.
We're being hailed.
On screen.
I am Third Magistrate Augris of the Mokra Order.
Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager.
May I assume you're seeking permission to conduct business with us?
No.
Some of my crew members have already been to the surface.
We've lost contact with them.
I see.
You must have been unaware of our regulations.
I'll transfer a complete copy for future reference.
I have reason to believe they're being detained.
Detained?
Thas possible.
I'll look into it for you.
I'll contact you shortly.
Thank you.
Are you in love with someone?
If you do silly talking
I will demand fare more than the meter reading
I am loving a guy
"Hey bell, if someone gets you biriyani, you will go with him"
-Are you in love?
"-Start, it's getting late"
These days it's hard to distinguish good and bad
Can't find who drinks alcohol and uses drugs
Can't find who is a terrorist
"Don't get trapped, tell me who he is?"
I will find out whether he is good or bad
-He is from which area?
-Ukkadam
-Where in Ukkadam?
-Sannathi street
-That's our street!
Is it that corner house Pandi or neighbor Kannan?
Or is it that fat ugly fellow with french beard?
"-No, it's the opposite house"
-Opposite house?
-That's our house!
Oh that must be Thankam
Has he trapped you by showing silver anklet?
It's neither gold nor brass
Who will love that black man?
"Then, I am there in the opposite house"
-ls that me?
-Yes
I love you I won't come behind if buy me a biriyani
Make me an ornamental belt I will come after you
You have fallen in love!
"You cur, you've come to harm innocent people again"
Get lost
Attack
"Don't cry, come"
Come here
Don't be frightened
Let's go
"Your name, sir?"
I am Chang San Fang of wu Dong
So it's you
"I am Sheung Yu Chun, at your service"
Please arise...
"Hero Sheung, you've been wounded internally"
I was escorting young master to the south when I was injured by the Monk who is your master?
Chau Tsi wang of Yuen Chou head pupil of the Ming Cult
That's right
Young master...how are you?
...
His body is cold
He's been hit by the Freezing palm
I have also been injured quite badly and was seeking a doctor
If you trust me
"let me take him too, how about it?"
would you be referring to the doctor of the Butterfly Valley?
Exactly
I still have a favour to ask
Since I am seriously injured and cannot take care of two kids
Could you therefore take my young master to wu Dong to be looked after?
"Okay, don't worry"
Thank you
who is this kid?
His name is Chang wu Ji
-They haven't had the time to replace it!
- Really!
Samsonov!
Mayor Samsonov reporting.
Replace it!
-Quickly!
"-Yes, sir!"
-He is about to replace it.
- Have a smoke.
-What is there on your mind?
- Thanks.
-Tell me.
"- First, we witness all distinctive signs of a trap."
"And ifthere is a mousetrap, there is a wayto deceive it."
There is no better place forthat than this hill.
I've already heard that.
"Second, my scouts took a prisoner who clearlyfed us false data."
Why?
He knewthat we'd check it and find out that the hill seems not to represent any imminent danger.
What ifthe Germans knew about the exact time ofthe offensive and were going to covertly pull their shock troops out to the hill bythe time it begins?
The front intelligence units reported that somewhere here deep in the German defence... there were mobile reserve tank units.
"The Germans are not so strong as they used to be in 1941, so they gather all theirforces into one fist."
How much time do you think they need to get to Hill 89?
"Well, ifthe road is good, it'll take them not more than two hours."
"OK, tomorrowwe are going tojump into this boiler."
May I come in?
"- Oh, it is you finally, Ivan Semenovich."
Come in.
"The oven is fuming all the time, it is really hard to breathe. I do not knowwhat to do."
Can you help us?
It is a nightmare.
-Can you see that?
"And when was this, sir?"
12 years ago.
And you believe that woman is Sara Collins?
"Yeah, I do."
"Your name, sir?"
Peter Manning.
M-A-N-N-I-N-G.
27 hours.
I got two calls from the director's office.
He's got half of Capitol Hill breathing down his neck.
Yeah?
"Well, if they want to do something constructive for a change, give them a badge and let them help."
I'll put that in the suggestion box.
We got the DNA back on these hairs we found in Jessica Nevins' hotel room.
They're Sara's.
Pulled out by the root.
Is there enough to issue a warrant for Miss Nevins?
No.
"But we're monitoring her credit card accounts, all her known acquaintances."
"She sticks her head out of the rabbit hole, we got her."
And Amanda McNeal:
Where are we at with the prelim?
Body's still frozen.
M.E. can't autopsy until it thaws out.
"Guys, Dockery's got something."
Surveillance footage from the Biltmore garage four minutes after Sara disappeared.
There's our Taurus.
And there's Valera.
"Sara's probably tied up in the backseat, maybe the trunk."
"All right, I want subpoenas for every exterior surveillance camera in downtown Atlanta-- security cams, traffic cams, weather cams,"
"Convenience stores, ATMs."
"And you can wake up every judge in town, if you have to."
- She didn't mean anal.
"Should I have told you that day in People's Park... when we saw that woman arguing with a trash can, and you said:"
"""I want you to meet my mom""?"
"And we laughed, and it was funny, except that could have been my sister."
"Yeah, you feel like crap?"
"Yeah, well, welcome to my world."
Heh.
Wanna know what real guilt feels like?
"When my sister finally went to the hospital,"
I dreaded her coming home.
"It was a relief when she was gone, and we..."
We were happy.
We felt like a family again for the first time.
"- Lucy, that's not true."
- It's okay.
- Honey.
Honey.
- It's okay.
Well... at least the chicken was good.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
"If you were really sorry, you wouldn't have said that in a room that didn't have doors."
"Look, I didn't mean to be cruel."
"Yes, you did, Allie."
You've wanted to tell me that for a really long time.
Do you realize that you're furious at me for being sick?
"I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
It's a very common theme in group.
See?
Anything I feel is invalid because you are the sick one.
"Nobody ever seems to remember that when my sister who I idolized, by the way, was supposed to just be laying with me in bed, was instead using my nightgown to strangle me."
- You have to stop taking that personally.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
Could you repeat that without the condescension?
Just say it to me like you're talking to another guy and not your six-year-old daughter?
What are you looking at him for?
I'm talking to you.
[laughs]
That what makes Goldie Goldie.
"You know, she's a straight shooter."
[chuckles] You got your spin.
"Anyway, don't worry about it."
I took care of it.
Got one of my girls to rewrite it.
You did what?
"I'm a producer, so I'm producing."
No.
"No, you don't hire writers."
"No, not without consulting me."
"Look, Marty, if I had a prick, I might stand around holding it all day, but I don't, so I have time to actually get shit done."
She'll have your pages by the weekend.
Come on.
"You know, for a woman who usually sees the big picture, that was extremely shortsighted."
I refuse to put out a mediocre product with my name on it.
I've worked long and hard to make that name mean something.
"Oh, come on, no one is disputing that."
"The problem isn't your message, it's the way you deliver it."
You kill more flies with honey.
What's wrong with a flyswatter?
You have to respect the network.
You can't treat 'em like a necessary evil.
"You ask me, they aren't all that necessary."
"Jesus, Gold."
You're not gonna break if you bend.
Named her Fen for the record.
Check for yourself.
And she's happy where she is.
I very much doubt that.
There's no force the way I handle her.
She's content as long as she gets fed.
So no law broken.
See for yourself.
I've nothing to hide.
Do you know this man?
Never clapped eyes on him.
I had to stop myself from throttling the man who keeps her.
I had neither the ability to arrest him or to rescue her.
She is his legal property.
That's appalling!
"A man is allowed to exhibit a young girl in a cage, and there's nothing I can do about it."
(Julia sighing)
What of our victim's body?
"His wounds were mostly superficial, the most pronounced being facial lacerations."
"He was gouged, likely by claws or nails."
And this.
A deep bite on his right hand.
The wounds were made with pointed incisor teeth.
So likely an animal attack then?
That would have been my conclusion if not for the stab wound in his upper back.
"The thrust was a downward motion, but not a fatal blow."
- Then how did he die?
- He bled to death.
"If he hadn't been trapped, he may have survived."
What time would he have been stabbed?
I couldn't say.
I only know that he died between 2 and 4 in the morning.
"So on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a black mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
I don't know anyone who fits that description.
Ah.
Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
-Is that a threat?
"-No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Hey, Father, wait a minute."
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
-That's too bad.
"-Yeah, I hate to go alone."
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
-Who's in it?
-Who's in it?
"Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx."
But we're still going to have to keep moving.
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
- That's all right.
- It's okay.
I won't think you're any less macho.
Someone else might need it more later.
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms.
The weapons I was sending to save you.
So I struck a new deal.
"We help get you out, and he gives us valuable information about a terrorist."
"Which he knows about, how?"
And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
"Colonel, we're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun."
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
If Stonebridge had managed to engage the Janjaweed then this would fit that scenario.
"Right, send through the image."
Julia thinks that lunatic might still be alive.
Really?
"It's probably nothing, it's an oil burn, or a blip."
Let me see that.
That's not nothing.
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Unfortunately I don't have the resources.
You said you wanted to meet him.
Besides we just got here.
Why don't you leave me alone?
"My uncle, who you saw in passing, raised me because both of my parents were killed in a car accident."
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to contextualize my sadness.
Put whatever you're going through into perspective.
My mom was pregnant at the time.
Seven months.
I was on the news.
"I'm telling you this to hurt you right now, because you're trying to make me feel bad, horrible even, which I don't appreciate."
But I never will...
Because nothing ever feels bad once you learn what that emotion is capable of.
Now let's not make a big deal about it.
I usually don't...
But you really forced my hand on this.
Do you know that expression?
"""Forced my hand""?"
It's one of my favorites.
She seems difficult.
She is.
Very.
"Well, you're putting her in an ugly situation."
What with you trying to have two girlfriends.
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.
(IKE CHUCKLES)
You have one living in a house that you share with her in the city and another one up here that you're living with.
"Yeah, I can see the appeal."
I practically invented it.
But I did it better than you.
Nobody hated me then.
I could enjoy it.
"I'm not wanted for anything, am I?"
Why don't you two fellows see... if you can get your heads together for a few minutes?
Go ahead.
- Do you know who I am?
- No.
What you used to be in the southwest...
I used to be in the northwest.
How does that work?
"I know that you've been, as I've been, a man hunter."
I was a tracker.
Better still.
John Coble's put in a pretty fervent recommendation for you... to The Cattlemen's Association to help control the rustling.
I believe his point was... handling rustlers after your experience with the Apache wars... should be like shooting fish in a barrel.
"Now, you're talking about... the high side of shooting and the low side of the law."
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you... you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.
"From the standpoint of the Association, that's going to be entirely up to you."
Whether I bring them in or shoot?
Is your problem.
You're a U.S. Marshal.
"You tell me, what's the difference... between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?"
A Marshal's checks come in on time.
"Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you to be in his Wild West Show?"
"Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona, where we had a lot of people killed."
He offered me my own act.
"Like I said, we had a lot of people killed."
Joe.
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.
"Man of the West, Indian tracker, and scared to death of lobster."
It was my first time.
What do you...
"Well, he called the other day, sir."
He asked for President Harding.
[Laughing]
- We can have a national prayer day.
"- Never complain, never explain."
"Come on, these are not fraternity pranks, John."
"No, this is anarchy."
It's a revolution.
"- I wouldn't go thatfar, sir."
- Why not?
"Is itworth it, sir?"
I mean...
Is the warworth a one-term presidency?
Because that's whatwe're looking at.
I will not go down as the first American presidentto lose a war.
"Going to Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos, buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance."
"- Exactly, sir."
"- Lfwe keep our heads, we'll win."
"- What, win Vietnam, sir?"
"- No, no."
"No, butwe can drive a stake through the heartofthe Communist alliance."
Henry's getting strong signals from the Chinese.
They fearthe Vietnamese more than the Russians... and they're worried abouta united Vietnam.
"Now, ifwe stick itout, we'll end up negotiating separately... with both the Chinese and the Soviets."
And we'll get better deals than we ever dreamed offrom both.
"That is triangular diplomacy, gentlemen."
"Exactly, Mr. President."
That's what geopolitics is about.
The linking ofthe whole world for self-interest.
"Ron, how I can explain that on TV to a bunch ofsimpleminded reporters... and, uh, weeping mothers."
"Yeah, butwhat am I telling the press about Kent State?"
"Ah, tell 'em whatthe hellyou like."
"Save me from the evil eyes, God!"
You are chattering again
Go see Hürrem Sultana.
She wants to see you
Run to your main Sultana
My son
My Mehmet
What's wrong?
Why are you sad?
I went to mosque with my father
How nice!
"But everyone said "" long live Mustafa "" Noone said anything for me"
They don't know you yet my son
You are little yet
"But when they recognise you, they'll shout out your name the most"
İbrahim will teach Mustafa Italian
I wanted to learn too.
But he said no
Don't be sad my lion
Your mother will teach you everything
Go inside now
The most unique of the Sultanas.
May you order
Order what?
You said to Esma that you want to say something
My Sultana you told me to have my eyes opened and to inform you if I hear anything important
Say it
A huge grant is given to Maidevran Sultana to do charity work
Mahidevran Sultana will have buildings built.
"Hans, baths, fountains"
She's giving out gifts to concubines
Is it Valide Sultana's order?
"- Oh, hey."
"Say, did you get Gene Hansen's toxicology report back?"
I'm looking for any evidence of narcotics.
I'll check and see when the results are due in.
"Okay, thanks."
Hey.
What's up?
You working that beetle mania case?
"Yes, I am."
I have reason to believe the club owner might have known about drug dealing in the establishment.
"If the drugs led to the kid's death, she could be held responsible."
"Uh-huh, you got it."
"Speaking of which, I need you to check some names for me - her and her staff."
See if they had any priors.
- Do you mind running them?
"- Sure, let's go."
"Yeah, I'll even throw in a little lunch, maybe a few..."
Wait a minute.
It usually takes a few minutes of sparkling repartee before you'll give up anything.
I'm trying to be nice.
Is that a crime?
"No, no."
Who's the customer?
"Hey, we doing this or not?"
Let's go.
All right already.
"Oh, glasses."
Hi.
"You know...when you're around someone long enough, you can spot their little clues, their 'tells'."
And this is apropos of...?
"Well, I was in the morgue today and Mike was there, you know, investigating that Jane Doe, and he offered to help me gather information, no questions asked."
That was nice of him.
Good luck!
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
Angel...
"You have been blaming yourself all this time, haven't you?"
"In this world, there's no one who blames you."
Every single one of you say you don't blame me.
"But, in private, you say that Mom's death is my fault!"
"Back then, I was opposed to having the baby."
Lily was right at the peak of her career...
"At that time, she was at the prime of her modeling years."
"I can't believe that for her child, Lily was willing to sacrifice everything."
"In the end, because of a child's request, she dropped all her work, and specially flew back in order to celebrate her birthday."
"Mary, you're up."
Give Auntie a hug.
Come...
"Daddy, Mommy died because of me."
Didn't she?
Of course not.
"Why would you think that, Mary?"
Let's go.
I'll take you to get something to eat.
You can't trust what adults say.
That's not how it is at all.
Don't have such foolish thoughts.
That's definitely how it is!
That's definitely how it is!
"Even now, Dad still hates me!"
"At this time, in the script..."
Lola appears.
"She cannot hold back the tears, but gently laughs once."
Why is it disdainful laughter?
No!
That Randy's happy without me.
What am I doing?
I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.
This is my worst idea since I told DeNiro to stick to comedy.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm saying this is a mistake.
Let's just go home like you said after that hyena knocked you to the ground and tried to hump you.
Can I get $12 on number four?
And on which aisle can I find tucking tape?
"Okay, I will just have these Slim Jims and a Ho-Ho."
It's not like I have to fit into couture today.
- Stop hitting me.
- Stop hitting me!
"Girls, stop fighting."
I hate to see women fighting each other.
"Well, unless, of course, it's Hoda and Kathie Lee over the last glass of chardonnay."
That's RuPaul!
From RuPaul's Drag Race!
We love your show.
We used to watch it through our neighbor Jeff's window.
"But then he met Dean, and now all they do is cook naked."
So we just watch that now.
"Oh, you poor babies."
"So, why the cat fight?"
Did she steal your size 12 stilettos?
'Cause I would cut a bitch for that.
We were actually on our way to Texas to see if she and her ex could patch things us.
"No, we're not going to Texas."
We're going back home.
Sometimes you got to admit defeat... and that there is a very live junebug in this macaroni salad.
"Oh, no, honey."
"Once that line is changed, how will she make Angel realize that her father does not hate her?"
"According to the script, Lola is supposed to gently say,"
"""Dad actually loves you a lot. """
Dad actually... hates you a lot.
Daddy doesn't like me.
Why do you think that?
"Because Daddy never takes me out and he doesn't play with me, unlike you."
"Mary, you hardly ever see your dad, right?"
Yes.
"When you see your dad, how does it make you feel?"
Very happy and also very scared.
That's right then.
Right?
Think about it.
Your dad is usually very busy and doesn't have time to spend with you.
"Therefore, in his heart, he probably feels very apologetic towards to you."
"So when he actually has free time to spend with you, he becomes nervous and doesn't know what to talk about or play."
Is that what it is?
Yes.
"Your daddy just doesn't know how to behave around you, because you spend too little time together."
"But, in his heart,"
I'm sure he loves you a lot.
Do you know that?
Lian is just like all the other adults.
He only says nice things to kids.
I'm not so easily fooled.
"I know that for a long time now, Daddy..."
"For a long time now, Dad has hated you."
Mary.
I'm crying.
I can tell.
"I'm not sad, it's because Jie Jie's performance is so good."
Can we do this later please ?
"Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams."
I'll give my deployment orders through sergeant...
Deployment orders ?
Fire teams ?
"Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before."
"Well, you've supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers."
"No, we were guerilla fighters."
All right ?
Hit and run.
"Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance."
I've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a whole different game.
"You're just gonna have to learn it fast, because that's what we're doing."
We're defending this fixed position.
Until chief finds his eye of Jupiter.
"Okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you haven't even found yet ?"
!
"Listen, Sam, I'm not even sure it exists."
But I don't have to tell you every little godsdamn detail.
You know what you have to explain to me ?
"The major's in charge on this one, okay ?"
Okay ?
"Well, I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your major."
"In my thought, that went really well."
- He'll do it.
- He'd better.
I miss Nicky.
- Do you think he's okay ?
"- Yes, he's fine."
- He's on Galactica.
He's fine.
Oh!
That's kind of devious.
"They might have, who knows?"
Were you in any kind of position where you could pretend that you weren't having sex?
Let's see.
You tell me.
"Johnny, tell me about the Catholic newsletter than you inadvertently subscribed to."
You don't have to.
We were having such a fun time.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Very religious household.
Three brothers.
"My dad, the only man who never actually had any porn in the house."
We went into other people's houses and their dad had a stash.
It was almost like being a dad meant having a stash.
"In the '70s, definitely."
"Inside the bath, the bath's plastic panels."
There you go.
"Mayfair, that sort of thing."
In the shed.
I could literally give you a tour of Carlisle of where all the porn was.
"I was a little girl, you know."
Cos there's nothing else to do.
It would be in a hedge.
"I used to walk dogs for the neighbours and walk round, because blokes who got rid of it hastily would throw it across the field."
Why is it always in a hedge?
Always in a hedge.
Porn would find you.
I feel sad now walking my dog.
There's no porn anywhere.
"You always think, ""Oh, God!"""
A badger attacks you.
Told you he thought you were cute.
"Couple drinks, one thing leads to another, you're heading out to the alley to go do the fairly obvious and, before you know it he's punching you, he's kicking you, he's all over you."
"Okay, I didn't meet him at the bar."
But I had seen him before.
I kept running into him outside the courthouse and I was like...
Outside the courthouse?
"Yeah, he'd be across the street at that coffee place."
I just thought it was his spot.
And he was big and muscly and like every gay man's fantasy.
I just couldn't believe that he was actually talking to me.
You know?
"So we started talking, and I told him that I was on the jury."
"I know I shouldn't have, but I just was trying to impress him or whatever."
And then he smiled at me this big seductive smile.
And he threatened me not to tell anyone.
So you lied to the police?
"- No, I was just..."
I was scared that he...
"- Did you happen to tell him, which way you were leaning, guilty or innocent?"
"Yeah, I told him innocent."
Okay.
"Kyle, we have to take this to the police."
It could change the whole outcome...
"- No way, man."
Are you fucking kidding me?
He's gonna kill me this time.
No.
Please.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
What do you have on tap?
First gay bar?
Newcastle.
There's something really cool.
"But it's so cool we just can't show it to you."""
"So,it's the easy viewing that's bothering you?"
No.
"Look,I'm sorry."
"I grew up looking at my dad's ""Playboys"""
"from the '70s,okay?"
Real boobs and shag carpeting.
"Times have changed,Augie."
Girls have gone wild.
That's exactly my point.
I don't think that the porn industry
- should be dictating fashion.
"- Okay,well, my point is that I don't care if I painted it blue and hung shingles on it, you should never ever walk away from it."
Ever.
"Dude,what's your problem?"
"I don't want to,like,open an old wound or anything."
"What would his fans think if he sees me and,like,bursts into tears?"
That you're the bitch that dumped him on his birthday.
- We should leavave.
- No.
What if he is the one?
Or what if he's not and you're just supposed to get back with him long enough so you can break up with him on Christmas?
So he can put out a holiday album.
Guess I'm just looking for an obvious sign.
Freaking psychic.
Women with acrylic nails always screw me over.
"All right,I'm running to the little girls' room."
Try not to be anyone's muse.
# And you think love is to pray #
# But I'm sorry I don't pray that way #
# Once I ran to you #
Wu-tang originated from Shaolin.
They are so ambitious as to compete with us.
The Highness will be the host of this competition.
Then please send me!
That's what's in my mind.
But we still have to get our chief's approval.
Tat-chi has only been with us for a short time.
He's still got a lot to learn.
How can he be our representative?
"Please decide, Chief!"
Why do you propose that Tat-chi fight?
"Although he has a short history with us, he has great potential and a firm foundation."
He would make an ideal representative.
Only a senior student can represent our temple.
How is your sole testimony supposed to sway me?
I don't think we should let seniority decide.
"Then since you must continue to insist,"
I would like to test him!
You don't have to argue anymore then.
Yes!
"Tat-chi, would you like to compete with Fat-chi?"
I'm willing to accept it!
Tat-chi!
You must do your best!
Please excuse me then!
Very nice!
"Fat-chi, excuse me!"
"Tat-chi, your strikes still cannot demonstrate a sure win."
Try your Chin Kang Fist now.
Let's see how you do with that.
Tat-chi!
Tat-chi!
"Now, he knows that you're part owner of Denver-Carrington."
He's trying to buy up that stock to gain a controlling interest in your company.
So he can drive a wedge between the two of us.
And then what he'll try to do is position you.
So that you have to side with him on anything at all relating to that pipeline.
Doesn't surprise me.
Doesn't surprise me one damn bit.
- Thank you for telling me about it.
"- Oh, well, I hope it helps."
"It does, it all helps."
"Well, I'll talk to you later."
"- Dominique, good morning."
- Good morning.
"Oh, could I see you in my office for a minute, please?"
"- Of course you may, Adam."
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
"Dominique, you know Jason Colby's chief counsel, Garrett Boydston."
I knew him once.
"No, thank you."
"Well, I need a complete fix on him."
"How he works, everything."
A personality and career dossier.
Yes.
"I'm sorry, Adam, but I am not in the dossier business this season."
"Look, anything, any little thing you can tell me will help."
"I've got to work with him, and at the moment, I'm flying blind."
I am no authority on Garrett Boydston.
You'll just have to find your spy elsewhere.
Dominique?
I didn't mean to strike a nerve.
I'm thrilled you'll have me.
Please toast to my beautiful bride   and her fantastic family who have welcomed me so kindly -
"- Jørgen, Helene, the twins..."
Cheers.
"Christian's lovely, don't you think?"
He's nice.
- He's so cute.
- Cute?
Maybe.
- I dated him before Anna.
- Was he your boyfriend?
But Anna gets whatever she wants.
It's not traditional for the bride to give a speech   but everything's gone so well so far.
I know Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong.
I'll do it now so that you can relax.
"My speech isn't for you, Christian."
I love you and you know it.
I couldn't be happier than I am today.
And don't worry.
I'll pay back the 1000 kroner.
But I'd like to thank Mom and Dad.
"Mom, I know we argue a lot now and then   but you are the best, the most loving   and the most loyal person I have ever met."
And Dad...
When I turned 18 a few years ago   you had to tell me that you weren't my real father... genetically.
You told me how Mom had known another man   and we didn't talk for almost six months.
It wasn't until I met Christian that I began to understand   why you did what you did.
"You did it to protect me, so I'd have a mother and father like everyone else."
I've had a dad.
You've been the best father anyone could ever wish for.
"And if I could have chosen, I would have chosen you, Dad   whether you're my father or not."
So I would like to say thank you.
Thank you for today and for everything.
Wanker.
Why don't you just stop being such a fucking pussy and let the fuck go?
Fucking leave me alone!
There you are.
Are you OK?
"Look at you, you poor thing."
Come with us.
We'll get you some warm clothes and a nice hot tea.
The Musical Society are going to do a performance for all of you.
HMS Pinafore.
"# I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee"
# Soft tommy and succulent chops
"# So buy of your Buttercup, Poor Little Buttercup"
"# Come of your Buttercup, buy!"
#
Come back!
There'll be cheese and wine.
It'll be fun!
There's always cheese and wine!
Take a seat.
Eventful day.
"Pissing around in pools, smashing up labs, avoiding activities, getting up to no good in the dorms."
- How'd you know what I...?
"- And now you turn up for an interview like, well..."
"You know, I'm amazed you actually even bothered, really."
"But I'm a fair man, so bearing all that in mind, why don't you try to convince me into offering you a place at this university?"
"Oh, you think you're so original, don't you?"
I have met a million kids like you.
"Yeah, vaguely intelligent."
Agonisingly middle-class.
"Read a book by Camus, a book by Kafka."
"No real substance, though."
"In 2006, I went and saw JK Rowling in New York City."
Where she signed this.
And this.
Which is now one of four tattoos on my body.
With plans for more.
APPLAUSE
"Uh, fun fact, that is the man that kills JK Rowling."
"If he ever has sex, he's going to shout out Expelliarmus, isn't he?"
I don't think he needs to worry about that.
"David, you write children's books, which are, and I've got the statistics here, much less successful."
"It's difficult to quantify the joy you bring to children, but, yes,"
"I bring a lot of joy to children, carry on."
"So you've written, what children's books have you written?"
"I've written a series of books called Danger Is Everywhere, which is, uh..."
Not as good as Harry Potter.
"David, David, can I ask you a sensible question about it?"
Who's in the films of your books?
"OK, well, let's have a look and see if JK Rowling is up there."
"Yes, it's JK Rowling!"
JK Rowling was once unemployed and living on state benefits.
"But now, she's richer than the Queen."
"Who, ironically, is unemployed and living on state benefits."
"OK, Rob, Rich, Ellie, who else is the nation's favourite Brit?"
"Um, I think people like Jamie Oliver, don't they?"
He's always doing something.
"Every time you look, he's got something open."
"Jamie's cockle van, Jamie's kebab stall."
Jamie's bag of chips.
"I feel like Jamie Oliver, like, he's really liked outside of Britain, but I don't know if he's popular in Britain."
He feels like the UK's Bono.
"Like, the more good he does, people are like, ""You smug prick, stop it!"
"""Try less, mate!"""
"The Great Gatsby, I think it feel really nice to get for the girls."
You might not have to buy too many since all the girls are quitting.
"Andrea last night, Annabel last week."
Don't get me wrong.
I am in love with your book club idea.
I think maybe the girls need a bigger moral boost.
"Something by Dickens, Great Expectations."
Little orphans are so cute.
"I don't think the book choice is the problem,"
"I think we could all use some real fun, like a party, with actual boys."
That's a wonderful idea.
- Seriously?
"- Seriously, I love it."
"A great Gatsby theme party, but educational."
As all parties should be.
"The roaring '20s, what a wonderfully rich historical period."
The fashion and music and prohibition.
"Prohibition, like..."
No liquor?
"I'm sorry, this chapter is not ready for a party with alcohol."
We have to find a place to host because of the rules.
Prohibited co and sociolizing in the house.
We must check the girls' GPA and their house points to see who can attend.
Don't forget about the 11 o'clock curfew.
We could have a dance instructor.
I'm gonna e-mail Nationals and tell them all about it.
They'll be so happy.
So will the girls.
Score one for the pledges.
"We're gonna have to get rid of your handicap, nice shot Bener."
Glad you could make it.
- I didn't know you were golfing today.
You saying Flack hit him?
"Mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination."
"I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol."
All were negative.
Don Flack did not kill this boy.
Find out what did.
"Now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?"
That's correct.
And what was his demeanor?
He was fine.
"So the kid's calm, perfectly healthy."
He agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
"He's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room."
"And then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead."
That's exactly whatappened.
"And if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you."
Did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
- Bruises?
- No.
Was Detective Flack ever alone with him?
"In the car, maybe?"
I drove.
Detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
We were together the entire time.
What about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
In the locker room.
Who accompanied him there?
Detective Flack.
Detective Flack.
Doesn't look good.
!
-Quick carry her inside!
-Yes.
"Are you alright, Priestess Yeo Mi-Eul?"
We thought we were going to lose you.
I'm okay.
You've exhausted yourself.
How's things in the palace?
"About the reinforcements,"
His Majesty hasn't come to a decision yet.
The ministers have differing opinions among themselves too.
It looks like His Majesty is having a hard time.
"It's just a yes or a no, must it take so long?"
As long as you agree to it.
BuYeo will receive the Emperor's benevolence.
I simply cannot understand all this dragging and procrastination.
"Prince Dae-So, please try again."
"If I try again, it'll only make it worse."
I cannot wait any longer!
"If you cannot decide soon, then it leaves me no choice."
What's that supposed to mean?
Haven't I made myself clear enough?
It's because of Prince Dae-So's hardwork that our nations... have the peace that they enjoy now.
"This has nothing to do with the reinforcements,"
It was solely between you and me.
Don't try to put them together.
I'm very touched that you brought me Hae Mo-Su's head.
"Concerning BuYeo and the Han Dynasty's diplomacy,"
I'm very interested in helping you out.
"But,"
"If you're holding back because you fear your father,"
Then it's a pity our friendship has to end here.
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
Get that coolant flowing.
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
Who is this?
"This is Dr. Victor Gannon,"
And I have just shut down your cooling system.
"OK, you've shut it down."
Get it back on again!
Tell him how expensive it is to put it back on.
"In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium, medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met."
What conditions?
Five million dollars in cash.
A jet waiting at the airport.
"A safe escort, of course."
"And most important of all,"
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon has achieved molecular control and mind control.
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.
How long does it take to count five million dollars?
We'll have to pay them.
Evacuate the immediate area.
Put Los Angeles on alert.
There's the big round ball.
- Is that it?
"- No, it was bigger than that."
Get outta here.
Leave me alone.
At least I tried.
And this is my personal safety device.
"It's a flashlight, it's a radio, it's a cell phone charger, it's a siren and it's a compass."
Hmm.
North is that way.
Handy.
"Also got canned goods, batteries, water, ooh, a gas mask and-- that's right..."
"North Korean currency, because you just never know."
"Hey, why are you wearing a jacket ?"
Are you cold ?
Let me get my space blanket.
It preserves up to 80% body heat.
A bit of bad news just in.
Our first fatality.
"Not a lot of information, a pedestrian hit by a downed power li..."
No reason to think its anyone we know.
"Yeah, of course not."
"Still, aren't families supposed to reach out to each other in times of uncertainty ?"
"I know the phones are messed up, but you were able to get through to Sandy and he was able to get through to Seth."
"Uh, right, you're worried about your mom."
Yeah.
She gave birth to me.
"If I'm worried she may be hurt, then shouldn't she be worried about me ?"
I think we need to go over there and check on her.
To her house ?
"Yes, Ryan."
"I know my mom is a total bitch, but she's still my mom, and she doesn't drink a lot of milk so her bones are probably very brittle and she's always been kind of scared of the dark..."
"Taylor, Taylor, we can't go over there."
Seth and Summer are coming over here.
What ?
Since when ?
Since Seth texted me.
He said that they were.
Perhaps we could have a duel.
"That's a good idea, I think."
"If Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Enright have a duel, one of them dies... sorted."
Mrs. Rogers takes to her bed.
She's waiting for an apology.
Underneath the trees...
Captain Glover has planned an afternoon to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar with a nautical picnic of salt pork washed down with rum and fresh lime.
"I'm going to introduce you to a distant relative of mine,"
Captain Blackwood... and there's the gentleman himself.
"He looks like you, actually."
You see the curly hair there.
I can really see the resemblance.
Look to your left.
Yes...
Needs a shave.
"My hair isn't quite that gray yet, but I'm working on it."
I have a letter here from Admiral Nelson to Captain Blackwood giving instructions to keep an eye on the fleet.
"So, as I pass that round, I'll read out actually..."
That's the genuine letter.
No way.
So I'll pass this round.
That's the real thing.
"It goes, ""To Captain, the Honorable Henry Blackwood,"
"""HM Ship Aureleus."
"""From the Victory, October 9, 1805, AM"
"""Cadiz due east, 19 leagues."
"""My dear sir, many thanks for your letter of yesterday."
"Let us have them out."""
"""In short, watch all points and all winds and weathers,"
"Be assured I am ever and always yours, Nelson and Bronte."""
Wow!
"At the house, Mrs. Rogers finally receives an apology from Mrs. Enright."
"That's what I say too, but you don't believe me."
"You're just lying to yourself, aren't you?"
You'll never know for sure whether your dad really wrote those messages.
I know!
I just know!
What's going on here?
Will the show continue?
Don't know...
You just know?
What basis do you have for saying you know?
Do you think you know your dad very well?
Back to the script.
Gong Xi is going back to Lola's lines.
She's acting again.
Yes.
She's back to Lola's lines again.
You've never had a proper conversation with your dad.
"All day and night, you just complain that Dad doesn't care about you."
You never try to be understanding of his feelings.
Isn't that true?
"Mary, how was your day at school?"
Did you play any fun games with your classmates?
Why does he ask the same question every time?
Lame.
"Bit nippy, but this time of year, what do you expect?"
"And as your daughter said, no-one really knows what's gonna happen."
You don't have to do this any more.
You can live instead.
Daddy!
You've been found guilty by a unanimous verdict.
"The law says you should be punished, but we don't have the resources to impose a custodial sentence."
"Therefore, I have no choice but to pass a sentence of death."
I'll hit at 11:00.
"When the diamonds get here, you check out."
- And don't let anyone see you.
"- What do you think I am, an amateur?"
"No, lover."
You're just a reluctant old pro trying to make a comeback.
So keep your fingers crossed.
[knock on door]
"Come in, Paul."
"Well, working kind of late, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Well, hallelujah."
I just thought you peasants might like a touch of glamour in your drab lives.
I'm impressed.
What kind of a singing job do you do tonight?
Thanks a lot.
I happen to be going to a very posh birthday party.
Protecting the family jewels?
"No, a wealthy niece."
Her aunt thinks her young man is a fortune hunter.
- Is he?
"- Well, he's poor."
"Anyway, the girl's 21 today, so Auntie had to let the guy come to the party."
"She's just afraid that later on, when things get jumping, the two kids might try and run off together."
"If the girl's of age, how are you supposed to stop it?"
"Well, I do know he was married in Texas once, so if I have to, I can try and run a bluff on that."
Wasn't he divorced?
So far I haven't been able to establish it-- either way.
"Will if the bluff fails, you should try charming her yourself."
I must say you do look dashing.
"Oh, you finally got around to admitting it."
"Good night, Perry."
- What time is it?
- It's very late.
"David, I'm sorry to awaken you, but..."
I feel that we need to talk.
"Doctor, we have talked."
How many times do you need to come here?
"I've told you I don't blame you for what happened, but that doesn't give me my hand back."
Whether you blame me or not makes no difference.
"It's you, David."
"You see no future for yourself, and that gnaws at me."
"Your concern is admirable... but there must be better ways for you to spend your time, because I don't give a damn."
You have a very special gift.
"Had, Doctor."
Had.
I'm very tired.
Good night.
"You know, you're being much too harsh on yourself."
You mustn't think that you failed.
But I have.
The boy's a graduate ofJuilliard.
He just embarked on a promising career.
"I reach out to him... but no matter what I do, I cannot get through."
- That's not your fault.
"- Oh, isn't it?"
"We both know that there are other doctors here more able to... show compassion, provide comfort."
I have no magic words.
I work my wonders on flesh and bone.
I perform no... miracle surgery on the soul.
That's-That's your department.
"Major, I know how difficult it was for you to come here."
It's obvious that you care a great deal.
- Of course I care.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself,under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites,the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"- Were you scared,Mr.Petty?"
"- No,ma'am."
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know,Mr.Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water,where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right,Mr.Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea,Mr.Madsen?"
"If you know,why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring,right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well,you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I'm looking for Kay Howard, we're supposed to have lunch."
Uh-huh.
"Well, um, Kay will probably be back in a second."
- Do you wanna have a seat?
- OK.
I've gotta go.
I understand.
I'm getting pretty good at being on my own.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Look at his, it's almost like it's getting back to normal in here."
When's Crosetti coming back from Atlantic City?
Tomorrow.
I hate to admit I kinda miss the little booger.
"Hey, you guys."
"Frank, this just arrived for you."
"Now, aren't you supposed to tip those overnight delivery guys?"
"Certainly, you don't have to, but I always feel like,"
"""Gosh, they got it here overnight."""
Wilgis's red wig from the murder site in Iowa.
"Too little, too late."
"This time next week, there'll be three movies of the week, six paperbacks and a deck of souvenir playing cards."
The cash cow has only begun to get milked.
"He's in one of those rare moods, Gee."
You didn't hold her for me.
You didn't do anything to keep her here including grabbing that lawyer by his legal briefs.
I needed five minutes.
You let me down.
"Maybe, but you better figure out what you're really angry about, Frank."
"Is it because Wilgis may end up in a mental institution instead of the electric chair, or are you ticked off because you weren't the one to get her confession?"
That you need it.
"Yeah, well, that's not why I'm doing this."
You sure about that?
"Tell yourself whatever you want, but going into the police station is a suicide mission."
Yeah.
"Be careful, Isaac, 'cause it almost sounds like you care."
Eric?
Jadalla... police found three bodies near the train yards.
"From the description, it sounds like Malik and his team."
"What about their targets, Carter and Grimes?"
Two men were seen fleeing the area.
They could be anywhere by now.
Keep monitoring police networks.
Find Carter and Grimes.
The Americans probably have the list by now.
"Your operation's failed, Jad."
You failed.
So what are you saying...
We should go back home?
"No, we have men and weapons."
"We move now, pick a target and launch our own attack."
We're here to finish what my father started.
"I respect you as his son, but you're not a soldier like him."
Your father fought the enemy from caves while you were studying at oxford.
But I am here now like my father always wanted.
You've told me you loved my father like a brother.
Prove it now.
Help me get the list and launch the sleeper cells.
Hey.
Mr. Harris called me into his office.
He wanted to talk to me before he went to the principal.
"I had to tell him about the text, okay, I had no choice."
And they let Franz go!
But you gotta hand it to 'em ― they both stood their ground.
The lawyer argued for two hours that Reinhold was marginally retarded.
Reinhold will have to pay him for that!
A pretty penny!
- Did they swear you in?
- Sure.
- On the Bible?
"- No, not that."
Good.
What do they want?
Either they want our picture or they're new recruits.
Here he comes.
We've gotta help Franz out with some money.
He won't take anything from us anymore.
It's all behind you.
You're rid of those guys now.
And you're rid of me too.
"Everyone has to find his own way, right?"
I'll find work.
And you have to tell yourself you just got out of Tegel.
Life is just beginning for you.
"Mieze is gone, and my arm is gone."
"Come on, don't give up now!"
You've always said you don't work with your arms but with ―
"Your kisser, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Shut those honorable kissers, because here comes the main attraction!"
Berlin pricks up its ears and holds its breath.
Even that policeman's arm hangs suspended in the air.
We've all been knocked on our rear end at some point.
"But it's stomach in, chest out, and back on your feet, or you end up in a pauper's grave!"
"Many among us have stared down grenades and shrapnel, stared right in their eyes."
"Somehow her energy, her essence..."
Even they weren't sure how it happened.
"Wouldn't it have been nice, Leena, if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them?"
"Lot of loose ends here, okay?"
So I'm not...
"That is why, Claudia, taking inventory is so important!"
So what are we saying?
What are we saying?
Are we saying that just Myka's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice?
"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying."
Looks like Myka.
Isn't Myka.
"And if we give voice to that thing, it'll trick us somehow to try to get out and that is not gonna happen."
We've done enough.
We promised each other we'd stop at $5 million.
"I'm a lying, convicted thief, Gary."
I'm breaking the promise.
"No, we're so close."
We're just a few thousand away.
It won't make any difference.
You need to see a doctor.
We don't have any insurance.
Please.
We'll be paying out of pocket.
I won't go unless we offset what that'll cost with an hour's worth of betting.
- Listen to yourself.
- You listen.
My hand can rot off.
I'm not going to any doctor.
We should take it now.
Take what?
Whatever it is they've got.
She's anointing him with oil.
CARNARVON:
"Now, mind your heads on the way in, it's rather low."
"Morning, Carter."
How's it all going?
We're very busy now.
"If you could just keep clear, I'll be with you when I can."
"Right, yes, of course."
Shall we come back later?
HOWARD:
Yes.
"It is beautiful, isn't it?"
"As soon as Tutankhamun was old enough, his queen was expected to produce a child."
The future of Egypt depended on it.
"Without an heir, the empire could be flung into chaos on the death of the king."
"Incestuous marriage between royals might have made political sense, but producing a healthy child from a union between sister and brother was fraught with risk."
"Tutankhamun's queen, Ankhesamun, miscarried at least twice."
But even dead babies were considered precious.
They were of royal blood.
Each was mummified for eventual burial with their father.
ADAMSON:
Would you make space?
"Go back, come on."
Move out of the way there.
Make space.
Move out of the way.
Come on.
Make way.
Make way there.
Move out of the way.
"Come along now, make way, please."
"You down there, move."
"She broke down all reserve in no time, and looked after us like her family."
And why not?
"After all, you are a blood relative."
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that Clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"Well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just old-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
Everything's going to be fine.
"- I don't want you to worry, sweetie."
- I'm not.
- Because it's not going to be like it was with your father.
I'm going to hold this family together.
- Fine.
"Marissa, listen to me."
"I know that there's a lot of uncertainty in our lives right now, but I want you to believe me when I say that Caleb is not going to jail."
"Oh, well, that's a shame, 'cause if Caleb did go to jail, then you'd be out on the street, and I could go back to living with Dad."
- So should we maybe exchange numbers or something?
- For what?
To work on our lab report.
"Oh, uh... no, I already turned it in."
"Don't worry, I put both our names on it."
"You'll get an ""A."""
"- Funny, I thought we were supposed to..."
"- Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing."
"The only reason why I transferred to Harbor was so I could load up on A.P. courses, get accepted into Yale early and never have to look at another cheerleader or water polo player ever again."
- No offense.
"- Okay, I think you got the wrong idea about me."
You think I'm stupid.
"God doesn't give with both hands, so..."
"take the ""A."" Enjoy it."
It's my treat.
- Uh-huh.
- Where are you going?
- Mr. Greenberg?
- Yes?
"That lab report Lindsay handed in, I'm afraid I'm not quite finished with it yet."
"Well, it looks perfect to me."
- Nice work.
You guys make a great team.
Before dawn we want a similar one
I can understand your plight
But all the members have gone out of station
"Arul has come, let us ask him to make it"
"Greetings doctor, why at this hour?"
-Come here
-What mom?
Why all of you are worried?
You must immediately make a wedding chain
Mom you know everything...
I can't
Don't be adamant make the wedding chain
"-Mom, I can't, you know I won't do it"
"- Don't shout, they are here"
"- It's very urgent, Will you do it or not?"
- I can't
Will you not obey your mom?
-They have come out of trust in us
"-Leave my hands, I am going"
"Wedding is scheduled for tomorrow, do it"
-I can't
- Do it for your mother's sake
- I can't and that is final
"- If you can't, don't meet me hereafter"
- Mom
- Don't give me reasons
- Why do you ask me....?
"- You don't do it, right?"
- OK
- We will collect it in the early morning
- OK
- Thanks a lot
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your Sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
"There was a meeting between the D.O.D. And Lockheed... in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 23."
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
Anything relevant they have from that date I want.
Tell them it's for Stan Beeman... and I have code-word clearance for the project.
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"[Gaad] Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect a call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want... and you wind up..."
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the K.G.B. Right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony... before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
"Let's say for instance, my poor, sweet mother comes in with symptoms like Mrs. Booth's."
What would you say?
Stroke?
Maybe she mixed up her meds.
"- Your poor, sweet mother?"
- Yeah.
I would have ruled out a stroke.
My next guess would be a form of dementia.
"But if your poor, sweet mother is anything like Ms. Booth, she'd refuse a full exam."
"And why would his poor, sweet mother do that?"
"Because she'd say she knew what was wrong, she'd seen it before, and she'd be fine."
"And what would happen next to my poor, sweet mother?"
- You'd let her leave?
- Not alone.
Ms. Booth couldn't follow simple directions to the washroom.
"At first, she wouldn't let me call anybody."
But then she finally gave me her daughter's number.
- Laura.
"- Yes, she said she'd come."
"After two hours, I finally called her again."
"She got real snippy, you know."
Told me she had a rehearsal and couldn't get away.
Ended up calling a car service.
And you're sure there was no one else that Ms. Booth asked you to call?
No.
She said she didn't have anybody else.
And her daughter was always too busy.
I felt sorry for her.
"- Thank you, doc."
- My pleasure.
"Well, whatever is wrong with her, maybe it's what's behind the panic that made her kill Laura."
"Well, she said she knew what she had."
I can write my essay later.
"Whatever it is, I'm in."
Wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
"If you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously."
Then let me drive the getaway car instead.
Or I could create a diversion or something.
"Hey, you want in?"
Accept the assignment.
Then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
What can I do to help?
Help what?
Help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
How do you know what we've been talking about?
You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
Could you make out with Amanda?
'Cause that would be hot.
It's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
"Number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence."
"That's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy."
"Bitchy, not cynical."
A total difference.
I was just trying to help.
?
Can I help you?
Hi.
Is Amanda home?
I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
Jin Tianyun!
"Master Shi, it's been 3 years since we met"
"Your temper is still so bad, huh?"
"Brother Jin, how come you're still here?"
I'm afraid that you'll be bullied again
So I came back!
"Jin Tianyun, you taught my apprentice in secret"
This is definitely against ethics
T alk about morality?
How complicated!
I don't know that.
Your apprentice saved my life
I taught him a bit as a way to say thanks
Why are you so mean?
"That's true, Master."
"In fact, it's good to learn more!"
"You traitor, you've betrayed our teachings"
And our school.
I'll kill you!
"Shi Zhengzong, the decent school talks about"
Loving and helping the young generation
But you blame your apprentice ;
even beat him up... in order to save your face.
"If you try to... give him a hard time again, I'll interfere"
"Jin Tianyun, I know how to teach my pupils"
You have no say here!
"You yelled so loud, don't you fear... it will break some more of your rib bones?"
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
"Just leave here, quick!"
"So, you're wounded"
If I fight with you...
People will say I've taken undue advantage
"Because every time we chase down a bad guy on foot, you drive."
Ah.
"Well, I am kind of a genius that way."
- Who's the hottie on deck?
- He's cute.
"- Our latest client, and he's engaged."
- Of course he is.
"Charlie, we're all here."
"- Morning, angels."
"- Good morning, Charlie."
I'd like you to meet Scott Foster.
He's here because his fiancee disappeared off a cruise ship.
It was supposed to be a 3-day trip.
Miami to the Bahamas.
That was two weeks ago.
Your fiancee went on a cruise without you?
She's working a story.
She's a journalist.
- And what was she chasing on the high seas?
- She never talks about her work.
"The cruise line registers their ships in the Bahamas, which puts this case out of American jurisdiction."
Cruise line give you any leads?
"They've been incredibly helpful, but the fact is, they don't have any answers, and there's no evidence of foul play aboard their ship."
"If she's alive, I need to find her, and if she's not- let's just stay positive."
Right now she's just a missing person.
"Scott, before we take your case, there is one last piece of business we need to settle internally."
You'll hear from us.
Thank you.
"All right, we'll walk you out."
Right this way.
Internal business?
"Charlie, don't leave us hanging."
I did find a breach on the same day the photos were downloaded.
I'm thinking someone could've pirated his signal.
Todd Fleming.
The alligator blood Stella found puts him on Nelson's roof.
Maybe that's what he was doing up there.
"Okay, so Fleming downloads the photos of the boy, and makes it looks like Coach Nelson sent them."
"I mean, it's possible, but why?"
"Clearly, Fleming wanted to discredit Nelson."
"Making a coach look like a pedophile, that'll do it."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nelson's apartment.
Stell and Lindsay found the alligator blood over here.
"Okay, maybe something."
"I'm getting a list of networks, but nothing strong enough to connect to."
It means we're in the vicinity.
"Okay, I've got several network choices now."
Signal looks like it's strongest in this direction.
"Got one Wi-Fi network that's fully unprotected, no password, nothing-- genius."
Look what it's called.
Vince N. Wireless Network.
"So all Fleming had to do from here was to release a prewritten script to Nelson's computer, turning it into a zombie."
Giving him complete control.
"The e-mail connects to the murder, I just can't figure out how."
"Yeah, well, we know Fleming didn't kill Nelson."
He had an alibi.
"Right, but Coach Nelson's wife said she saw two people up here."
He might've had some help.
There's sawdust over here.
Sid found sawdust on the victim.
But Stella and Lindsay would've found the sawdust when they were here.
Not necessarily.
You will hear nothing.
Local disruption of structure is now irreversible.
Logopolis is dead.
They've done this deliberately.
You've done this deliberately to deprive me of my prize!
Nothing is solid now.
Entropy has taken over.
What's he done?
Everything began to waste away when he interfered.
But why?
-The numbers were supporting the whole system.
-I don't believe it.
My biomechanism's untouched.
-The degradation is random.
"-No, Monitor."
This is some crude defence mechanism.
A device to delude me.
"Come, Nyssa."
No.
"The entropy you released is eroding your systems, too."
Entropy absurd.
The power is weak.
Some freak interference.
-Increase the power.
-More power would simply speed the collapse.
Don't.
"From this point, the unravelling will spread out until the whole universe is reduced to nothing."
So it's true.
"Yes, Doctor, you were right."
Our numbers were holding the fabric of the universe together.
But how?
"Surely in a closed system like the universe, entropy is bound to increase."
- Think on thy sin.
- They are loves I bear to you.
"Ay, and for that thou diest."
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas... why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents;
but yet I hope...
"I hope, they do not point on me."
"- Peace, and be still!"
- I will so.
What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee...
- thou gavest to Cassio.
"- No, by my life and soul!"
"Send for the man, and ask him."
Take heed of perjury;
thou art on thy deathbed.
"- Ay, but not yet to die."
- Yes presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath... cannot remove nor choke the strong conception which I do groan withal.
- Thou art to die.
- Then Lord have mercy on me!
"- I say, amen."
- And have you mercy too!
I never did offend you in my life;
never loved Cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as I might love:
- I never gave him token.
- By heaven...
I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman!
I think Mom and your dad are wrong on this one.
I think... .
"I think if you want the operation, it's your hand."
The only one who knows how it feels is you.
Did I really just hear you tell our son that you think he should get the surgery?
_
"This is not what we do, Lena."
"What happened to ""unified front""?"
"- I, honestly, I disagree."
"- Fine, but you do not go undermining me with our son."
- Our son?
- Yes.
Or your son?
"Look, Brandon is 16."
He's old enough to know that we don't always agree on everything.
"And I wanted him to know that if he still believes in this dream, then so do I."
"It's not a dream, Lena, it is a fantasy."
Do you really want to see Brandon devastated again?
We can't protect our kids from disappointment.
"And if it happens, and I'm not entirely convinced that it will in this situation, then we help him, we help him to learn from it."
"Well, you have fun with that, because after all of the disappointments he's had over the last few months,"
I am sick and tired of teaching him that lesson.
Hey.
So guess what?
Moms just bought me Dawn of Armageddon 4.
Haven't even played it yet.
We can open it when you come over.
I can't spend the night tonight.
"Oh, ok."
What about Saturday?
I kinda can't sleep over at your house... ever.
What?
Dana!
We just found out we lost our qualifying slot.
"We don't qualify, we don't race."
"Believe me, guys, I'm working on it, okay?"
The racing committee assumed we weren't racing because of what happened to Jared.
"If we don't race, we don't get points."
"Look, I know this is a hard time for you, but..."
"Don't worry, I'm on it!"
"Harrison, Cal, these are federal agents."
They're investigating the crash.
Investigating what?
I thought it was an accident.
"Yeah, we're not so sure."
"Go, get ready."
I'll get us a slot.
"Sorry, I gotta get back to work, guys."
Whoa.
"No, not until you tell us what you and Jared's father are hiding."
We know Jared was stabbed.
"We know he had over $100,000 of stolen money in his garage, and we know there's no way that you didn't know something about this."
"And this does not look good for Jared right now, Dana."
"If you care about him, you'll help us."
I wish I could.
"If you're scared for some reason, we can protect you."
"But if we find out you're withholding anything, we have to arrest you."
I have to go.
Please.
(cell phone beeps)
That must be one hell of a secret.
Yeah.
A text from Sebastian.
It says that Christopher wanted him to tell us that Jared was definitely murdered.
- I hope you'll let me stay with you.
- Sure.
Go and eat something first.
Good idea.
Let's go.
"Now, let's talk about you."
"Go on, tell me what happened."
What do you think happened?
The usual.
It wasn't pleasant.
"Listen, I know from a reliable source when and where Ramírez's plane is going to land."
We've been waiting for something like this.
- We'd have no problems at the airport?
"- No, I'll deal with that."
The place will be teeming with soldiers.
We'll never get close to Ramírez.
"You're not planning to shoot down that aeroplane, are you?"
- What else can we do?
- You want to kill all those innocent people?
I don't want to fight for our cause in that way.
"If we do something like that, we're no different from them."
The other passengers are as bad as Ramírez.
But they're not fighting the world.
"I agree, but sometimes you're forced to do things you abhor."
It's either the death of a few innocent men or the suffering of a whole people.
Hold on a second.
The whole thing might be a large-scale trap.
That's a risk we must take.
There will only be three of us.
I'll take Smithy and Hidalgo with me.
We'll meet just before the operation.
Any questions?
"FIRST, YOU GET OUT THERE AND YOU PROVE YOU CAN PLAY."
THEN YOU CAN START TALKING BACK TO UMPS.
THEN YOU START DEALING WITH WRITERS ON YOUR TERMS
INSTEAD OF THEIR TERMS.
THEN YOU START FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THE HOTELS ARE INTEGRATED.
"AND OVER TIME,"
JACKIE ROBINSON HAS PUSHED US FORWARD.
"FOR HIM, THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION"
WITH SIMPLY BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM.
BARACK OBAMA:
PART OF WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON IS
PRECISELY HIS ABILITY TO APPROACH BASEBALL
AND THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF INTEGRATION
IN WAYS THAT WERE CONTRARY TO HIS CHARACTER
OR HIS FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG
IN SERVICE OF A LARGER CAUSE.
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN.
HE HAD PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND MANY TIMES OVER.
NARRATOR:
"ON APRIL 15, 1947, JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON BECAME"
THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MODERN AGE
TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
[CHEERING]
"IN HIS FIRST SEASON WITH THE BROOKLYN DODGERS,"
"HE HAD SILENTLY ENDURED RACIST TAUNTS,"
"THREATS, AND ABUSE,"
PERFORMING SPECTACULARLY ON THE FIELD
AND BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEN IN THE COUNTRY.
"LATER, UNBURDENED OF HIS PROMISE TO BRANCH RICKEY TO KEEP QUIET,"
"TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK,"
"AMERICANS WOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE REAL JACKIE ROBINSON,"
AND THEY WOULD NOT ALWAYS LIKE HIM.
It was everything he had.
I'd get the rest as soon as he got out.
Where'd he say the rest of the money was coming from?
I don't know.
"He told me was there was a lot of it waiting for him on the outside, but in order to get it, he needed to get out today."
"Skeet, I'm Detective Williams, this is Commander McGarrett."
We hear you and Walton Dawkins were neighbors.
For four and a half years.
Warden says you used to be pretty tight.
"Well, in the non-biblical sense, if you dig what I'm saying."
"So, what happened?"
Why the beef?
I didn't appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week.
He said I was asking too many questions.
Questions have anything to do about why he bounced today?
It's possible I may have some pertinent information.
"But, uh, you're gonna have to play me for it."
- Play you?
That's right.
"You win, I'll tell you everything I know."
What's to stop me taking that and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
"They got better food at the hospital, anyway."
"What the hell you got to threatened me with, man?"
More lockup time?
Okay.
Might be able to help you shave some time off your sentence.
"- I'm doing double life, gimp."
- Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
You can shave ten years off my time but I ain't never getting out.
When you're around Like 30 feet of water.
You're on the edge of the first And second atmospheres.
Then you have to deal With the possibility.
"Of, like, nitrogen narcosis."
And the bends And that kind of thing.
Say there's like 5-ounce-an-hour gold.
"At 45-feet out of sledge Island,"
Then I want to dive it.
"So if I'm doing deeper dives, Then there is that danger Factor."
Where you could get bent.
"And if you get bent Or something like that,"
You may or may not be able To get back to town.
"If there's an accident, And you're."
All right.
I'm headed down.
I don't know what I'm coming down on.
"Kind of murky, And I'm pretty deep here."
All right.
Weird.
It's like a field of loose Gravel and small stones.
I don't know what it is.
"From the side of the island, I don't know."
You're about 34-feet now.
Copy that.
I never forget How dangerous gold mining is.
In pursuit of Our objective... gold...
We forget how dangerous What we're doing is.
"When I'm on zeke's boat, I'm terrified for zeke."
"He's a crazy diver, He works really hard,"
"And that could definitely, Like, enhance the impact."
The pressure that depth Has on you.
"I mean, this looks like The kind of place you see gold."
"We need our ""A"" game, people."
Now we all know Mystique has a perfect inspection record to uphold.
"So, yes, I'm talking about a sanitary food preparation environment."
But I'm also talking about something bigger.
I'm talking about pride.
"Okay, on to the walk-in."
Let's monitor those cold-holding temperatures.
Thanks for coming.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
It's freezing.
"What do you guys got the A.C. On, high?"
That's part of the problem.
"Yeah, take a look at this."
"[Shudders] Got the heater turned all the way up, but..."
But still this ungodly chill.
"With all due respect, Mr. And Mrs. Burke, just because your thermostat's broken doesn't mean that there's a ghost in your suite."
It's not just the thermostat.
"The last few nights, the lights, the TV, they turn on and off without us doing anything."
We haven't slept a wink.
I knew it was a mistake to buy this place furnished.
[Mrs. Burke] It's spooky.
It's like her presence is still here.
"Look, uh..."
[Clears Throat]
I know there's probably a logical explanation for all this.
"But my wife, she's a little superstitious, you understand."
Of course.
Of course.
"Well, lucky for you my friend Mike here is an expert at this stuff."
"Mike, you wanna take a look at the thermostat?"
I'll call Maintenance.
- Treat me as you would a stranger.
"As for you, Mr. Buff um, it might be wiser if you didn't speak at all."
I never met a Kentuckian so plainly from Massachusetts.
[thunder]
Do you have your pistols?
Keep them hidden.
"In this business, you never fight unless you've failed, and we won't fail."
Nothing can stop us.
[thunder]
Nothing.
[Pittenger] Andrews gave us 3 days for our journey through the Cumberlands.
"Traveling by twos and threes, we were strung out miles apart in a desolate country."
"We'd been supplied with Confederate money, but food and lodging were scarce, and transportation out of the question."
"My companion was the Giant, Bill Campbell."
"As I came to know him, I felt a growing concern over his quick, violent temper."
One such powder keg could blow our whole expedition sky-high.
"We reached the Tennessee River on time, only to find it impassable."
"Pardon me, ma'am."
Do you know the whereabouts of the ferryman?
"Home, like enough."
But he won't chance it across before morning.
River's swole up mighty angry.
- Could you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?
"[Pittenger] Flemingsburg, Kentucky."
Inn's pretty full.
We can pay double.
[thunder]
"They're from Flemingsburg, too."
There's a score of us in all.
We couldn't abide the Yankees anymore so we pulled up stakes.
Gonna throw in our lot with the Southern army.
Mama knows you're hiding things from her.
"Leena, this isn't the right time."
When is right time?
The child is around and we can't say a word.
"Mama, why don't we talk later about the theatrical swamp?"
"Sure, stick your head in the sand."
What are you hinting at?
"I'm just saying that for the past months you come here and talk about everything aside from ""the matter""."
"- I already told you about ""the matter""."
"I told you when it was in the papers, I told about the police."
I don't sleep at night and friends is a term that doesn't exist anymore!
"Is that ""the matter"" for you?"
I understand you're talking about me.
We're talking about this whole family.
"A family with a big blemish, like cancer."
"Yitzhak is not a thief, do you understand?"
"I read the papers, they're investigating, there will be a trial, it could end badly."
And please don't smoke in the living room!
He had no choice but to write out fake invoices.
The theater wasn't paying him.
He was supposed to get percentages on ticket sales.
And it was a musical.
A grand operetta.
Who says they owe him a bonus?
He took what was coming to him!
Not honestly.
Fictitiously.
But we don't talk about that anymore.
We keep quiet here.
I don't keep quiet.
I'll tell those who need to know.
Not you.
- Just checking.
"- No doors, people."
You have no idea what it is like growing up in this house.
- I'm not saying I do.
- Know why that poster is still on the wall?
Because my life stopped when I was 12 years old and it did not start back up again until a year ago.
"Since the first time Lucy got sick, everything has been about her."
Doors!
You wanna know what's funny?
It was about her before then too.
She was the smart one.
She was the pretty one.
She was the star of the family.
"Apparently, that was not enough for her, because then she got sick."
And she dominated every moment of our lives.
- Everything else was just put on hold.
"- Okay, I can't listen anymore."
- I'm going upstairs.
"- No, Mom."
"No, I wanna hear this."
- I wanna hear the unvarnished truth.
- I like my truth with a little varnish.
Know what it's like to postpone your birthday because your sister sees giant rats running across the floor?
"Or to have your parents so distracted all the time that they can barely get through the day, let alone find the energy to come to your stupid soccer game?"
"If Lucy had a bad day my mom wouldn't get out of bed for the next two days or weeks, depending on how bad it was."
I'm really sorry you had to go through all that.
- I wish you had told me.
- On our first date?
Or second?
How about the first time we did it from behind?
- When she says that...
Just...
# Can we say we'll do desserts all round...?
#
"Oh, yes..."
# Ices in the chiller only got vanilla
# Or the sweet for which we are renowned
# In shit hole or in chateau
# They know Black Forest Gateau
# Though ours has never been too near Berlin
# It's wrong to brag
# It's just cake in drag
"# But it's ""gateau"" at the Berni Inn"
# On my grave will be chipped by a monumental mason
# There could never be a better life than Frank's
"# Had a wife had a child, had an avocado basin"
# Bath and lavatory from Armitage Shanks
# And it feels so sweet to have given you this treat
# And that is why we felt we must insist
# That we journey in to the Berni Inn
# To demonstrate the life you've missed... #
Sorry.
Can I just stop you a second?
We're leaving.
"We don't want to spend any more time with you this evening, or ever."
You're not staying for coffee?
It's Irish coffee.
After-dinner mints come with.
"No, we're going for a nice cup of tea."
Tea?
I just felt he was belittling me.
"Well, us."
"He was trying, but we shall not be belittled."
We shall fight them in the chip shop.

Did you see any pregnant lady running from here.
"""l did'nt see anyone, King"""
"""Where had you gone, swami?"""
"""T o Uma"

That widow's name is also Uma.
She is bringing up the two boys..

"""Mother will surely help, but what is the their future, Lord"""
Sometimes you talk in such a way that I feel you are mad.
"""What is my mistake, Lord?"
"-lgnorance can cause mistakes."""
Now only you said Mother Parvati will help in the...
"""...upbringing of those boys, then immediately you ask their future."""
"""When Parvati is going to help them, how will their future be?"""
"""Lord, I have been caught in my own web of words."""
"""Always you trouble others, Narad."
"You just understand that..."""
...those two boys will always get the mercy of both of us.
They will cross all hurdles and come up in life.
Their mother will also attain fame  get peace due to them.

"So, it was you."
"I have something very important to inform you, but now it is much to dangerous, I am being followed."
"I will contact you,"
Careful!
"Excuse me, miss, did I harm you?"
"No, not that much."
"Now you will tell me that you had another fight, and someone tried to kill you, right?"
"Of course, look..."
We have been waiting three minutes for you.
Excuse me .
Ms. Bristol but...
There is no time for explanations!
We will begin our business.
"Our best weapon has been and always will be, terrorism."
It has given us great results in countries that are already under our control.
But... but what has happened in the countries where you work?
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Only some skirmishes and nothing conclusive.
This is why we are meeting here.
Report to me your activities.
"I will advise you of new systems, and new weapons."
Where is that red head?
"She went out a few minutes ago, Madame."
The red head was here with us.
"Decreased activity in his left culmen, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate."
Jacob is communing with his God right now.
There's nothing that you could label as abnormal in the scans.
But we haven't got all the tests results back yet.
Something is wrong.
This makes no sense.
Jacob always rebelled against his parents' religion.
Were his parents orthodox?
"Oh, yes, hard-core."
A tendency to believe in God can be inherited.
"There's... there's even a specific gene,"
"VMAT2, linked to religiosity."
Maybe your trip to Jerusalem triggered something that was already there in him.
I always knew his parents would ruin our marriage.

"Oh, please tell me that's what I think it is."
Your very own cronut.
I had to wait an hour in line to get it.
They are officially a thing now.
Mmm!
I think I just found the key to enlightenment.
"So, has the cronut earned me a walk to my place?"
"Oh, we don't have to go that far."
"All right, if we need an elvish riddle to get through that door, I'm gonna marry you."
This is the electronic age.
Okay.
"This is, uh... most definitely enlightening."
What's up?
Reynaud's blood work came back.
We did a complete metabolic panel.

Who has been dropping Milk Duds on my carpet?
Screw this.
I'm going to Eric's.
"[Jackie Yells, Laughs]"
On Top Gear:
The driving god does a track day.
A foie gras car with a luncheon meat badge.
And we try to set a new land speed record.
Hello!
And we start tonight with some good news because I've finally found an advantage to being over 40.
"Yes, hair sprouts out of your ears and yes, hangovers last a fortnight, but all you youngsters - the only chance you get to drive a Subaru Impreza and a Mitsubishi Evo VIII is on your PlayStations."
"Whereas me, with my wise shoulders and my hairy ears,"
I'm allowed by the insurance companies to take them to the best driving country in the world.
Scotland.
You seem so different.
- We're not.
- l think you are.
"I mean, come on, Malakai's scary."
Very scary.
What you mean by scary ?
"Kai's tough, he has to be."
But he's still got a good heart. I know.
Maybe you only think you know.
"Look, Malakai may not be the boy next door, but he's still my boy."
"He does some shit that I'm not down with sometimes, but I ain't never going to cross him offand be like everybody else."
"So, you're not down with the stuff he does, but you are down with him ?"
- That makes sense. I understand.
"- He's my friend, Sara."
You don't have to understand.
You don't have to understand.
"Listen, me and him got into some shit awhile back-- some bad shit."
Broke into a liquor store and cracked open the cash register.
"Somebody peeped us and called five-0, and we barely made it out of the store."
The cops were on our asses.
We split up and ran in different directions.
"Now, I must have been going in the wrong direction, because the cops were closing in on me."
"So, Malakai, he smashed in some car windows, set off the alarms... and turned the heat from me to him."
"I kept running, and he got caught."
The DA offered him everything but a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.
"But he didn't, and he never will."
"I stole a hat once, when I was 12."
But my Mom found it and made me give it back.
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.l.
Are you gonna turn me in ?
I think I'll wait for you to surrender.
"At the end of the conversation, y'all,"
"I kid you not, he says,"
"""And I impregnated America."""
"I said, ""Worth it."""
This whole conversation was worth it to hear Kanye West say he took his penis and fornicated with the United States of America.
My life is fucking awesome.
"I said, ""Thank you, Kanye."""
It's amazing.
"He's--I'm telling you though, he's a cool dude, man."
"There's nothing bad between-- He's a very cool guy, very nice dude, you know?"
There's no beef whatsoever.
"And when I met him, I was star-struck, and that does not happen a lot."
'Cause One Direction came to SNL.
Nobody cared.
It was so funny.
We did a shoot with them.
"It was 200 extra girls, and it was One Direction."
"As soon as the girls saw One Direction, they just lost it, they lost it."
"They were like, ""Aaahh!"""
"I was like, ""Y'all are 11."
"""You shouldn't be touching yourselves like that."
"I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now."""
They got escorted out.
One Direction leaves.
I went to where the 200 girls were standing.
"I kid you not, y'all."
It smelled just like farts.
Do you know what that means?
"That means they were so excited to meet One Direction, they almost shit themselves."
"Now, that's a different type of fame for your ass."
"I know about famous, but not shit famous, right?"
"I ain't never had somebody come up to me and be like,"
And you can accommodate it.
You look jolly.
"You see girls, this is what happens when you go poor."
"You'd think that you'd get thinner but you don't, it's weird, it's the opposite."
I've got an interview!
"Oh, Jenny love you're getting to be an expert at these."
"Oh, I've got a feeling about this one."
"I put my CV in this morning, they rang me this afternoon to say that they wanted to see me!"
"What's the position, poppet?"
Practice manager at the doctor's.
"Oh, practice manager."
And presumably if you do well in that then later you'll have a go at being the actual manager.
"No, Mum."
"Mum, practice manager means running a practice."
"Yeah, NHS management."
Yeah I'm donating my skills to the public ***
I'm not Barack Obama post-Harvard.
"Oh, hat's great news, Jen."
"Still rather you than me, all that red tape."
The only person I answer to is Nick Pope.
"Nick, you're in my seat."
"Oh, sorry."
And as I'd be earning I reckon we'd be able to rent somewhere of our own.
"Mommy, what's rent?"
"Nothing you'll ever need to worry about, kitten."
"So you might be moving on then, poppet."
Well let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It could go the way of the others.
I think it's brilliant.
"Go for it, Mum."
"Thanks, Becky."
Go for it!
"The point is, the times I actually felt okay with it was when the person showed they cared and let me talk through it."
"Okay, hold on."
"So the girl just rode by and shouted,"
"""I don't want to see you anymore,"""
and kept going?
Okay.
You tried to teach me how to get the girl?
Now I'm going to teach you how to break up with the girl.
The right way.
How are you going to possibly do that?
"With my proven method, which is..."
"Hold on, give me an hour."
Overthinking!
"Are you coaching me through a breakup, or is Jason Bourne on the loose again?"
The reason I overthink things is because I care about what other people are feeling.
That's what you need to learn: empathy.
"Okay, now, we don't have the time to turn you into a fully evolved human being, so I'm going to teach you how to appear to be one with the help of..."
Please do not say role-playing.
"I am Amy, you are you."
"Hey, Jack!"
"Ugh, payroll!"
Boop!
"What are we doing tonight, sweetheart?"
"Um, I'm breaking up with you."
This isn't working.
Boop!
Very direct.
But you want to leave her feeling good.
"Well, what do you suggest?"
Maybe some light over-the-clothes stuff before I bounce?
"Oh, my God, things are a mess in payroll, my mom's sciatica is acting up, and now you are leaving me?"
[fake crying] [whispers]:
# Go with the status quo #
# Go with the status # # 'cause that's where we should go... #
It says this D.V.D. sold more copies than any D.V.D. ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out, guys."
"If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done."
I no longer have any connection to this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good-bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes,"
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it either-
- Kenny?
No fucking way I'm doing it.
"All right, we promise?"
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
- I swear.
- I swear too.
"Okay, good."
"What happened, I thought you were gonna kill yourself."
I tried.
Went to sleep in my Mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
But you didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and the democratic west side.
# East side west side #
# Whatever side that you're on #
# As long as we care about each other #
# We can still all have some fun... #
Not a stick nor a spar.
"Looks like we're on our own, then."
What happened to them?
Where are they?
They must have sailed.
"If there are no British ships, there will be French ones."
We should go.
- We will.
- Back to Gibraltar as I suggested?
"- Bring her about, Mr. Scott-Padget."
"- Yes, sir."
"Boatswain, stand by to wear ship!"
Mr. Ponsonby I want you to send Crawford into the tops for two days.
"For punishment, sir?"
Do as I tell you.
I wish to speak to the ship's company informally.
"Muster all hands, if you please."
- All hands to the after well deck!
- Come on!
Jump to it!
Are we heading back to Gibraltar?
We'll stay on this course for the time being.
"Well, lads, I've got some explaining to do."
We seemed to have lost the fleet.
I want you to know the orders for the fleet and for us which are to escort a convoy of timber ships from the far side of Italy back to England.
"Timber to build ships of the line, and frigates."
More like her.
Defiant.
We must go to the place of rendezvous and see if the convoy is there.
"If it isn't, well, we tried."
"If it is, we'll bring it back in the face of Frenchmen, Spaniards or anyone else who tries to stop us."
- Back to your duties.
- Here we are.
"- Good-looking school, doc."
"That must be the new principal, you know?"
"They really give it to you, didn't they?"
"Like everybody else, they really give it to you."
Have you been drinking?
"Work yourself to death, then they bring in an outsider to pick the plum."
You have been drinking.
"I know you keep a bottle in the basement, but I won't have you bring it into the classroom, ever."
Don't forget.
It'd do your kids good to learn how to handle liquor instead of algebra.
- You're talking like a fool.
"- Oh, be I."
I sat in this classroom four years.
I sat right here.
Everything important was learned somewheres else.
You never applied yourself.
"If you had, you might've learned something in school."
"Tell my wife, a cleaning woman."
"- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets."
- Stop it!
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
"- I said, stop it."
"If you had applied yourself, you might have learned how to live intelligently."
There ain't nobody in this here town living intelligently.
Nobody.
- I don't believe that.
- All right.
Name me one important person graduated from this here school.
Name one.
You can't.
"I'm gonna tell you something, Ms. Thornton something you can teach your class someday."
"I promised him, no plums in the basket."
Okay.
I made room for some of Mike's stuff in the hall closet.
I'm gonna take these things over to goodwill.
Don't you dare.
Those are your dad's clothes.
You can't give those away.
"Mom, he died 25 years ago, and this leisure suit passed away ten years before that."
I don't care.
You're not giving them away.
"Oh, it still smells like daddy."
Hai karate and hot sauce.
It's gonna be so weird having another man living here.
"By the way, I was wondering if you guys could clear a little space for him in the bathroom."
"Ooh, that big man in our little bathroom?"
Yipes.
Don't worry.
"All he's got is a razor and a toothbrush, and for some mysterious reason, a shower cap."
It's not about counter space.
We're worried about the beating that toilet's gonna take.
Mom.
Why don't we make him use the downstairs bathroom like we did with dad?
There you go.
"Just throw in a good, industrial-strength plunger and a big scented candle."
"Citronella, like they use at campsites."
Or we could just rent one of those porta potties and put it in the backyard.
Good idea.
Then it becomes the neighbor's problem.
"All right, this is the last of it."
We got a dreamsicle and what is either a frozen tamale or a pair of yellow dress socks.
I will have the dreamsicle.
I'll spin the wheel on that tamale.
Open this gate!
Goodness!
What's going on?
That conniving bastard!
What is the meaning of this?
!
We are looking for a criminal who not only embezzled government property but stole valuable goods intended for His Majesty's use.
Begin the search!
Don't be like that.
You can't do this to a friend.
Go to the tavern if you can move around.
He said he'd be there waiting for you.
I think you should listen to Master Bang.
What are you talking about?
We're not letting Soon-shin go anywhere.
I think Master Bang's concerns are valid.
I think he worries too much.
Kyun...
"You know what he went though to stay in the institute, and he doesn't have much time before the exam."
Who's out there?
"Soon-shin, this is you!"
What's wrong?
It's Baron Huh's doing.
I will go to the authorities at once and reveal the truth!
No.
This warrant with your sketch means that they have acquired solid evidence against you.
But still...
Haven't you seen what they have done to your friend?
They will make up a crime if you are innocent.
"But, Sung-ryong..."
You must flee for now and find a way to prove your innocence.
Darn this rotten government!
He has gone with him.
"Chun-tae, listen carefully."
"When we land, I'm going to make a run for it while Yum Moon is attacking Buryung."
"But if we get caught, we're dead."
Why would we get caught?
I just don't have a good feeling about this.
Jang Bogo will kill us at this rate.
The best plan is to run away.
Got that?
Are we going to work for Madam Jami?
We can decide that later.
- Got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Chief Jang.
Yes.
I have never disobeyed the master until now.
I know.
You would obey his orders even if they led you to your death.
I still remember the time you jumped off a cliff without a word when the master ordered you to.
"At the time, I couldn't understand why the master was so cruel to you."
"But with time, I've learned how much he cares for you."
It bothers me that I've disobeyed him.
But I am doing this for him.
We will self-destruct at this rate.
He will understand my loyalty for him when we return with provisions and weapons from our attack on Buryung.
You'd better answer my questions truthfully.
Then your life will be spared.
Yes.
Where are Yi Do-hyung and Yum Moon now?
"Master is on the ship, and the head chief is not on the island."
Then where has he gone?
He's gone to secure provisions and weapons.
"Mind your head, mr gundelach."
Arrest her!
Arrest her!
"Cornielle, arrest her!"
Sir.
Sir?
What is it?
You better come have a look.
What the hell's goin' on?
Eva's been found safe and well.
Where?
At her Uncle's.
"Kids, hey?"
All that panic for nothing.
I want to get a solicitor.
Does Christy even know I'm here?
What the hell is going on?
Are you going to charge me or what?
"The 49 year old fisherman was airlifted to cairns base hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition."
"The police investigation into the murder of 4 year old brisbane boy Thomas murnane has been reignited, with the detention of the boy's mother for questioning."
The 32 year old woman was taken from her home by homicide detectives and is assisting them with their inquiries.
"This comes after the recent release of Benjamin gundelach, who had been a figure of intense speculation after finding the boy's body in mid December."
"Lawyers for the woman insist she was not involved in her son's death, and will fight any charges."
A police spokes...
What did you get?
"Ah, massaman beef, green curry and golden parcels."
Yum.
Do you want to get started on the mortgage papers?
"We should eat first, yeah?"
Good idea.
Where's eva?
Eva?
Those cases have nothing to do with this case.
The jury will disregard.
Please disregard it.
Please disregard it because that's exactly what they do to people like you and me.
"We are disregarded because, unless we make them money,"
- unless you're putting cash in their pocket--
- Objection.
- Ms. Papagian-- - ...no value to them at all.
Sustained.
"Uh, really, one more time, and you're done."
All right.
"Well, I am done."
Here's the thing.
They're going to tell you that Ryan Larson was suicidal.
Absolutely a lie.
In no way was Ryan Larson suicidal.
Thank you for your time.
Hi.
That was interesting.
It's very impassioned.
The evidence will show that Ryan Larson left a suicide note.
"Look, Borns Tech is in the business of protecting America from terrorism."
That's what we do.
"Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Leonard Letts, my co-counsel, and Lucy Kittridge."
Lucy's brother died in the war effort.
"He went overseas, and he lost his life to enemy fire protecting this country and all the principles that we hold dear."
Lucy's brother--
- Objection.
- ...wasn't a war profiteer.
[whispering]
He was a patriot.
And so is Borns Tech.
If I'd tell you some details you surely remember me.
We'd spend the entire day talking and arguing.
About everything.
Theology and ethics...
Everything.
And suddenly I'm remembering all those conversations.
And I'd like to clarify some misunderstandings that happened back in the days.
"Father Urlieta, are you there?"
"No, It's not about any religious doubt."
"In fact, what I'd like to talk with you is about those conversations."
You were very efficient and convincing when arguing.
It was some kind of dialectics full of sophisms.
An authentic brainwashing.
I'm not trying to offend you.
"In fact, my intentions are pure."
Absolutely pure.
I just wanted to see you and talk with you.
I'm sorry but I'd like to see you.
"Yes, yes."
Any other day.
I'll call you.
"Well, thank you Father Urlieta."
Bye.
Man!
You look good with that beard!
What have you done?
You'd be surprised by the enormous amount of sounds around us.
And we don't listen to them at all.
Do you use that for your compositions?
We'll see...
I'm not sure.
You could compose some kind of horror symphony with those noises.
Time tames the strongest grief.
"My father's bitter grief, rage against the world that crushed me."
I put it all behind me and forgot about them.
And I had hoped that world would forget as well.
But the world was not so kind.
"The same shackles that tied me down have now tied you down, and I am powerless to free you from it."
Father...
That jerk.
I'm the fool for having thought of him as a friend!
What are you mumbling about?
"What are you doing here, Father?"
Didn't I tell you to stay home and rest?
I can rest when I'm dead.
I should work as much as I can when I can.
"If you keep that up, you will be dead!"
Don't worry.
It's sick men like me that live to be seventy!
I won't die until you're married-no.
I mean until your children are married!
What?
!
The people are refusing to pay their taxes?
"Sir, there are riotous protests."
Imposing another tax so soon after the last collection is...
Then are you going to pay for them?
They protest bee use they don't realize the severity of their crime.
Isn't that so?
"Yes, sir."
Then what should we do?
Pardon?
You're so dense!
Think!

"Obsolete brand, slight yellowing."
But the ink you used... the ink told us the rest.
"We extracted the ink from the note, Kevin."
"From 1969 to 1994, consumer ink was infused with a Coumarin compound."
It's a plant extract.
They're called chemical date tags.
Determine the compound and get the year the ink was manufactured.
"Once the ink's extracted, it's analyzed with thin layer chromatography."
The tags react to ultraviolet light.
"Which shows the ink on your note was made of compounds C, A, and B."
Which is unique to only one year : 1990.
"And the writing, unique to one person."
You.
Krystal Sneed's Class of '90 yearbook.
Which you signed.
We matched the handwriting to your note.
"""I know about the curve."
"You're a dead man. """
He stole the science midterm test.
Got a bogus 98.
Set the curve for the rest of us.
"Made my 91 look like a ""C""."
Kept me out of Vanderbilt.
And you waited 15 years for revenge.
What ?
I
- I didn't kill him.
Krystal told our homicide detective that she saw you and Patrick arguing right before he was killed.
Kevin.
Bro.
"Always expected you to show up at Vanderbilt, and, uh, follow through on your threat."
You kept that ?
Ah.
Here we are.
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank.
How perfectly lovely.
Ha-ha-ha!
Again?
It must be adding something.
"Wait a minute, it's sending a further message."
"- What is, darling?"
-Here.

"Batman's life in great danger?"""
"Oh, it really seems as if your criminal career is over even before it starts."
But I am certainly not going to risk your life.
Let's take the gamble.
"Batcomputer's known to be wrong when it's elected to go off on its own, right?"
"Ah, ha, ha."
"No, but I have a brilliant idea."
"Tarantula, go upstairs, get Grandpa off his rocker and bring him down here quickly."
"Batman, you wouldn't by any chance happen to have an extra Batsuit just kind of lying around, would you?"
"Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, we do."
Lovely.
Lovely.
"Now, Tarantula, I want you to bring my makeup kit and I want you to make Grandpa to look exactly like Batman and I will make myself up to look exactly like Robin."
"Now, look here, darling, I want you to call the manager of the just-opened Heritage First National Bank."
You may use my Web Phone.
Try it.
"NARRATOR""."
"While Black Widow hatches her plot, at Commissioner Gordon's office..."
I don't know what he's doing behind that mask of his but at least there haven't been any bank robberies in quite a while.
"- That's a good sign, isn't it, Chief O'Hara?"
-A very good sign.
You also missed out.
You are just drunk.
We'll see.
Let's go to sleep.
"No Ivana, it is true."
You also played and you lost.
What the devil are you saying?
Are you crazy?
"Waiting for you, I gave them security."
"Waiting for you, I gave them safety."
I am expected to do what?
You said that I am expect?
You gave the security - of me?
"By the devils, who do you think you are?"
"Unhappy cretin, miserable ruffian, traitor shit!"
"By me, they can very well wait forever to get their security."
"To the devil, with you and your friends."
"They are crazy Ivana, capable of anything."
"Only to get it straight, the problem is yours not mine."
"You and your gambling games, I am tired."
"Perhaps, because for the want of Filippo, or by the perverse... pleasure, to see him totally dependent on me,... three days later decided to go to pay this dues,... this extravagant debt of my husband."
"In addition, I confess, I was intrigued."
The blonde and the dull.
What value for the both of them?
"See, help me."
Get the dress.
Still beautiful?

-Answer me.
Love?
-Yes.

"The Escape""... at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern California."
The theme park ride is the stage... for a spectacular free-fall demonstration.
It will showwhat happens when a carfull of people... and a tennis ball fall from 415 feet in the air.
Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, my God."
The riders are shot up the 41-story-tall tower... at a hundred miles an hour.
"With their eyes open, gravity will help them see a superhero."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
I'm going to drop this ball now and--
"Oh, my God, it's floating around!"
It's floating!
It's floating!
"Oh, the wind blew the ball away that time."
"While we expect all objects to fall freely together, regardless of mass... on a windy day, results aren't always perfect."
All right.
"Oh, my God."
"At the very top of the ride, when upward motion has stopped... gravity takes over and the downward free fall begins."
I'm going to drop this ball... and it's going to float.
It's going to float.
"Oh, it's floating."
It's floating.
I'm going to release this ball now.
"And then, for a few blissful seconds... theme park thrill-seekers feel weightless... as ifthey are free of gravity, or in what scientists call zero-G."
"Oh, that one floated well."
That one floated well.
"Oh, I'm going to try dropping the ball."
But zero-G isjust an illusion.
"In reality, gravity is running this ride."
A gloomy dawn.

- Figure it out.
"- Yeah, figures it out."
Don't you tell me to figure it out.
Yous are the ones should figure it out.
"All you have to do is sit down with a matchmaker, answer a few questions, and then she sets you up on three dates with girls that she thinks you'll jive with."
Has anyone heard from Jivin' Pete lately?
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"No, Jivin' Pete's one nut got all swole up..."
I don't give a shit about Jivin' Pete's one nut.
"No, no, this is a story about Jivin' Pete's other nut."
"Yeah, Jivin' Pete's had himself a botched vasectomy a little while back, so now his one nut's there all swole up bigger than the first nut that was all swole up."
If you can believes that nonsense.
Was Jivin' showin' it to people again?
"Oh, he's showin' it to people."
I seen it.
"- You seen it, Dary?"
"- Oh, I seen it."
"- Yeah, I never seen it."
- It looks like a rambutan.
"Which is to say, this hairy fruit."
"So, not smooth like a persimmon?"
DAN:
"No, although it is about the size of a persimmons."
"Which, of course, is much like a tomatoes."
"What sort of potent peace pipe was some prick pulling off when he titled tomatoes ""fruits""?"
Well...
"Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts have a story, which I hope guarantees that I'll never have to listen to another story about Jivin' Pete's nuts."
- He's a good guy.
- He's a real good guy.
"- No, he's a great guy."

You're looking for love.
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Whenever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again"
I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice in that matter.
Come on.
Just whoever fucking controls it... just no place cold.
Do that for me.
I'm trying to...
"He's bronchial, that's why."
"If he's legitimately bronchial, we'll take it to consideration."
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that
"God forbid, something happens to my parents they get sick, I can't going see them?"
"Maybe something can be worked out, if they're sick if there's extraordinary circumstances..."
I can't do this.
"I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Excuse me, Karen, I told you before."
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
"So, you do whatever, but... that's it."
You?
You created Poopie Penguin?
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
What's Poopie Penguin?
That's right.
What's Poopie Penguin?
What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?
"Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points."
Penguins don't fly.
No.
They do in my universe.
"Let me explain something to you, my kids, Charlie and Grace, they play this game non-stop."
Must have spent $100 on it just last month.
"Yeah, that's the beauty of in-app purchases."
"Yeah, I don't think there is anything beautiful about it."
I think that it is a scam.
You're ripping off children is what you're doing.
"I mean, you give them the app for free, and then they got to pay if they want to keep playing for the power-ups and the boosts or whatever you call it."
You're like a drug dealer pushing dope.
"First taste is free, then they're hooked for life."
"Don't hate the player, hate the game."
"I hate the game, I do very much."
Would you please stop and let him focus?
He needs to focus.
This is important.
(sighs)
"I'm just curious, how do you think of something like that anyway?"
"Ah, simple."
"A, poop is funny."
I'll give you that.
"B, it's relatable, everybody poops."
"I got the report, but they're not some lowly weapons dealer at a local market."
No one knows how deeply connected they are with anyone.
"I know that you, Alpha team, have no fear, but... they have neither fear nor law."
You cannot pretend to be the UN to cross the border anymore.
"They know now, and have even dispatched the Korean army to patrol the border!"
We switched over.
Take it easy.
"If things go bad, there's only so much I can do."
"Well, you know"
I have my people in high positions.
Dead presidents.
Congratulations.
You just got promoted.
Don't forget your present.
They were smuggling arms (weaponry).
"In other words, merchants of death."
It's best not to run into them.
"Hey, you know better."
You and I both don't have much longer til we go back.
"If you go back, you will get promoted."
I will get promoted as well.
Let's avoid things that can be avoided.
Alright?
"Yes, I understand!"
Write the report with detail.
"Yes, I understand."
And take this.
There is an order for an urgent transfer.
For Master Sergeant Seo?
It's an order to report to the Special Forces by the Commander of the Special Forces.
I understand.
You may go.
The groom isn't supposed to see the bride on the wedding day.
"Well, we have a few details to work out."
"Nothing that can't wait, I hope."
-Dr.
Rasgotra's scrubbing in on this.
-l am?
Yeah.
You did that open lap in the street.
I think I can trust you in a sterile operating room.
"You're not getting cold feet, are you?"
We'll talk later.
Are his vaccinations up-to-date?
His pediatrician and I don't believe in them.
Immunizations are probably one of the most successful...
... publichealthinterventions ever developed.
"Thank you, but it's a personal decision."
Did you know the air has 21 percent oxygen in it?
He's studying the atmosphere in school.
"Well, that's very cool."
"He's sitting at 94, which is low, but nothing dangerous."
It probably has to do with the fluid I heard in his lungs.
"I'd like to get a chest x-ray, which is nothing scary."
It's just a special kind of photograph and it doesn't hurt at all.
My uncle Deaver had one of those and we got to see all his bones.
Mm-hm.
"-l don't want x-rays, if possible."
"Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty sure Stewy has pneumonia."
"Well, can't you just treat it then, and we can avoid the radiation?"
"Well, it's a small amount. lt just helps us have a look at what we're dealing with."
-Glenda's waking up.
-Thank you.
Wouldn't you go with antibiotics anyway?
One of Sam's whales won 300 grand at a private table.
And he's back at it today.
But I checked the tape and everything's on the up-and-up.
Just one of those runs.
Right.
Look.
"I don't want Monica finding out about these phony chips, all right?"
She owns the place.
Kinda hard to keep her out of the loop.
"Unless she's preoccupied with some other major crisis like, uh, this dealer who can't seem to deal a losing hand."
"I'm just afraid, Mike, that if she finds out about it, the wrong heads can roll."
You know?
Like mine?
I don't want the cops involved.
Not yet anyway.
Not until we get our money back.
- Mr. Deline.
"- How are you, Sarasvati?"
Good.
They told me you needed to see me right away.
Right.
"The, um, daily revenue reports, when are they scheduled to go out?"
"An hour or so, but if you need it sooner-"
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I'd like the distribution delayed till I tell you."
"Mr. Deline, under normal circumstances,"
"I would gladly accommodate your request, but Miss Mancuso had already requested-"
You just tell Miss Mancuso that it was my decision.
We don't want her to find out about the counterfeit chips.
Oh.
It's very hard for me to be duplicitous.
Which is why we love you.
You said it yourself.
We did it once.
No.
You helped us make a baby.
Wait.
What?
Are you serious?
I just got back from the doctor.
I'm... pregnant.
You're gonna be a father.
"You, too."
"So, even with the added ingredient of suggestion, our numbers are about the same."
"Maybe a little better, but not better enough."
"Well, a little better is not nothing."
It was a nice dream-- a cologne scientifically proven to attract women.
"First of all, it should be marketed towards women, not men."
"A perfume that a woman could put on to help her feel more sexual, perhaps even awaken a whole part of herself that's been dormant or repressed."
"You know, it is what's happening out there in the real world-- a sexual awakening."
That's exactly right.
"So, if we could tailor this research and turn it into a perfume"
- for women...
- But--
Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.
"""Do I want to feel sexy and aroused tonight?"
"Yes, I do."""
"Now, that-- that would be exciting."
"Yes, it would if it were true, but it's not."
We don't have the numbers.
"Virginia, I'm sorry."
I think my work here is done.
What are you guys talking about?
- Mrs. Tate.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the I-got-caught-cheating diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
It's a family heirloom.
"Yeah, I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half-sister over Christmas, so I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully... that she can suck it."
Okay.
I got to bounce.
Stop saying that.
This DJ from Dubai is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
"I was still young, and I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me would be a total disaster."
She's like an entirely different species.
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
"Wow, my phone has a clock."
And they subsist on a diet of pointlessly weird combinations.
Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber jalapeño egg cream."
Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
She'll bounce back.
It's not like she hasn't had any practice.
That's true.
"And even if you do quit, it's not gonna help her any."
She's still off the play.
"Oh, that's good."
I gotta write that one down.
(Opens drawer)
"You know, if you really think about it, if I'm in the play... (Pen clicks)"
Then Sue's in the play.
"Yeah, don't go with that one."
"...and then I heard the door, and then I came here."
Brick's grandparents and special people day--
Any of that ring a bell?
"Oh, well, I-I don't think that was, uh, that was actually a firm commitment."
(Scoffs) Nothing's ever a firm commitment with you.
This is what you do.
You didn't even bother to show up at my wedding.
"(Chuckles) Well, who has a wedding on a weekend?"
Everyone on Earth.
"You know, Brick was really counting on you, and... (Sighs) You know what?"
Forget it.
"I'm not gonna even bother explaining it to you, 'cause you're never gonna get it."
Hey.
Thought you could use a snack.
Now is grandma dead?
"She's fine, but speaking of grandma, well, you know, that reminds me of a funny story."
"When I was little, your grandma and I decided it would be fun to get matching mother-daughter dresses, so we went shopping all over town looking for the right ones, and finally, we found the perfect dress,"
"but they only had one, and it fit grandma, but it didn't fit me."
Ohh.
"Anyway, grandma got the dress, and I was so happy."
She bought the dress?
We're planning the registry for the most important day of our life and he just leaves.
Maybe he's just feeling a bit of...
"A bit of what, anxiety?"
Can't believe you're defending him.
What?
"No, no, no, no."
I'm not defending him.
You just don't understand.
You can't possibly comprehend what it feels like inside of me right now because you've never been here.
"That's, that's true."
"I used to think about what it'd be like to live your life, Dale."
Just walk in your shoes.
Nobody expects anything from you.
They don't.
No one expects anything from me?
Uh-uh. 'Cause you don't have parents expecting babies... and marriages and perfect husbands.
It's really hard.
"That's true, but it doesn't mean I want to end up alone."
"Tell me something, Dale."
Am I expecting too much?
"Is wanting my fiancée to be excited about our wedding, is that too much?"
"I don't know, Jill."
"Back at St. Mary's, for our first communion... the biggest deal was finding out who you were gonna get paired up with."
I dreamed of walking down the aisle with Billy Dobson hand in hand.
"But, no such luck."
"He was paired with Jill, and I ended up with what's his face who picked his nose all the time."
I wonder if I'll ever get to walk down the aisle with a Billy Dobson of my own.
"Ah, is this your parents?"
Yeah.
That's them.
And is this you with your mother?
Yeah.
"Tea, coffee...?"
"Ms Tanya, you wanted to buy my house."
"Of course, I remember"
I have still preserved this cheque
How many more zeros will you add?
Sorry
"I must sell my house, else my family will break up"
Are you still interested in buying my house?
Had you not sold it already I'd love to buy it out
Had I not sold it...?
I don't understand
"Mr Batra, your house is no longer your property"
You've sold it already
To whom...?
To my fiance
"If you're interested, you can see the papers"
Take a look...
"your signatures, aren't they?"
Yes... these are receipts I wrote out when I borrowed money from Shekhar
Yes.
"But you mortgaged your house when you took the loan, didn't you?"
How did these papers reach you?
Shekhar is my fiance.
And your house is my wedding gift
Don't tell me you want to make a singer out of Tanya
She can't sing.
All she knows is how to make money
"Shekhar, you deceived me...?"
What deception...?
I never imagined!
For the money you were grabbing my house

I first saw you at the same party where you met Ben.
"I even pointed you out to Ben, because I took one look at you and I was totally smitten."
But Ben Boykewich moved in on you before I even had a chance.
Huh.
Interesting.
Yeah.
We should go.
"No, we shouldn't."
"If you were my daughter, I wouldn't just let you walk out of the house with some guy I don't know."
Ask me anything you want.
And I will try to answer honestly and to the best of my ability.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Honestly?
Yes.
I have a real sweet tooth.
What's your favorite dessert?
Whatever you like to bake.
What does your father do?
He's a male nurse.
He works in assisted care.
He wanted to be a doctor but his dad died when he was young and he had to take care of my grandmother and that's how he got into the field.
He's very patient.
He likes older people.
Our culture is very respectful of the elderly.
What would your family say if someday you wanted to marry someone outside of your culture?
I've already asked.
"We've discussed it at length, and my parents feel that matters of the heart should be decided by the heart."

Let me get the cake.

"- Oh, come on!"
"So, what's an American doing in Dunkirk?"
"No, scrub that."

- Fighting.
"- Yeah, so what does that make him?"
- A priest?
"- No, we need a hero."

- Travel writer?

- A journalist.

You're not pinching any more action from Rose and Lily.
I'm not unpicking the entire bloody structure either.
"Will somebody give them a hand over there, please?"
All the way up.
"Of course, the irony is, they've given this to a bloody documentaries director."
"He won't want any dialogue, anyway."
"It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football, you wait."
"What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?"
"He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie."
"Self-sacrifice, that's noble."
- Only if he stands a chance.
- Maybe he does.
"Maybe she likes him, because he's the sort that'd let her fix the propeller."
"So give him a name, our journalist."

We got to get some of his money to pay for this presidential suite!

He should not be alive now sir.
I'm the one who should kill him.
Correct sir.
Kill him till you relieve your anger.

- No!
I'm happy!

"Okay, let's forget negligence."
We'll just go with wrongful act and fraud.
Excuse me?
You're willing to waive the claims of negligence against Borns Tech?
That's correct.
That's your strongest cause of action.
You open yourself up to malpractice.
"Well, instead of going with an innocent mistake, we're going to go with a conspiracy."
You're willing to waive the negligence claim?
I just did waive it.
They say he killed himself.
We say he didn't.
We say Borns Tech had him working on an illegal weapon that blew him up.
It's very simple.
"Your Honor, could I have a moment to, uh--"
- Please.
- ...speak with my... people?
"Okay, thoughts?"
"Nope, I don't like it."
What are you talking about?
There is no evidence of any intentional acts or of a cover-up.
"If he's willing to go with wrongful acts and fraud, we win."
Mm-mm.
- Ahem.
- Counsel?
Assassination of who?
- This guy?
- No.
He was delivering the gun to an assassin who is likely sitting out there right now.
"Well, then they should just shut down the terminal and question everybody."
And let it happen again somewhere else?
No dice.
"We got a locked room full of suspects out there, Inspector Poirot."
"Yeah, and if the target's out there, too, he'd probably be dead already."
It's got to be someone on an incoming flight.
"McGee's running manifests right now, but..."
Oh.
There he is.
"Well, that was fast, McGenius."
Hey.
Manifests are on their way.
"In the meantime,"
Gibbs wants to keep an extra set of eyes on you.
But security at the airport won't let us access their surveillance.
Yeah.
They're very touchy about their cameras around here.
"Yeah, so much for interagency cooperation."
"Well, uh, look, if a camera's what's needed, maybe, uh... maybe this'll do."
On three.
"One, two..."
"Rest there, Mr. Beers."
We'll get back to you shortly.
Bishop's photos from the airport.
"Yeah, let's take a look at this imposter."
Whoa.
Is that me?
Most likely the storm wreaking havoc with the power grid.
"Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction."
This man is not a prisoner of war.
Not anymore.
He's a saboteur.
He's a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
"Come now, you threw a time bomb."
How could I have had a time bomb?
They searched me when they took me prisoner.
"And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely."
All I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.
I am not.
"According to the Geneva Convention, this man-- ls there anything in the Geneva Convention that'll let a guy sleep?"
- You were saying?
-Simply this.
After the hostilities are ended there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission.
"If the man should be convicted without proper proof you will be held responsible, Oberst von Scherbach."
- Interesting.
-isn't it?
Very well.
If you insist on details I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb.
"Good day, sir."
You will forgive me for receiving you like this.
Perfectly all right.
I do not like boots.
Schulz!
I believe it.
I believe it.
Let's have your dog tags for the Christmas tree.
What's the idea?
I just started.
Oh?
Yes.
I want you to leave my crew alone.
Don't dance with him.
Did it make you angry?
"Don't accept his gifts, either."
I believe the dear captain's Jealous of me.
I don't care what you believe.
Keep your hands off her!
"How curiously human, how wonderfully barbaric."
I've had enough of your attentions to her.
Of course.
"That's the root of the matter, isn't it?"
"You fight for the attention, admiration, possession of women."
"If it's fighting that you want, you may have it."
Are you challenging me to a duel?
If you have the courage.
This is better than I'd planned.
I shall not shirk an affair of honor.
A matched set--
Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton.
"And, Captain..."
I never miss.
"Captain 's Log,"
"Stardate 2126. 1, delayed report-- the whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself Trelane."
"We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games."
"I've decided to make my move with the field-of-honor game, and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient dueling pistol."
"Oh, how fascinating."
I'm party to an actual human duel.
Ready?
"Quite ready, sir."
I don't wanna watch him.
I wasn't talking to you.
"Your girlfriend, she's very pretty."
She's a bitch.
Margaret is an uptight Wasp cunt from Connecticut.
Can I use your works?
"Yeah, It's allright."
But give me an extra four hours.
Sure.
Do me a favor...
Can't get around to get off.
Relax baby.
-Takes a lot.
-You should be happy.
Paul give us some money we can go take a lunch.
So what?
Get ready to go.
It gets this bitch two hours to get ready to go out somewhere.
In the beginning aliens were spotted in places with large amounts of heroin.
"Later, aliens appeared in specific sub cultures, punk cultures."
Still around heroin and in these punk cultures many more strange deaths have occured.
"Big fucking belly, eat your food!"
"Apple pie, shit!"
Why don't you ask something to eat some cheese some...and taste some wine...
Nothing strange about deaths in punk culture.
They kill each other by shooting too much dope.
I remember when we were...
in Cambridge there was war
I think between the Mods and Rockers.
They went on each other with bicycle chains.
I don't think your punks need help from the outside to kill themselves.
My mother used to bake five or six apple pies at once.
So do I.
I hope we can preserve it without any more Shilohs.
"They say the slaughter was so fierce on both sides, you could walk across the field on dead bodies like stepping stones."
"How would you like to put a stop to that, Pittenger?"
"Could we, with what we're doing?"
Maybe we can.
"[Pittenger] We managed to be on the Friday train, headed south."
"So far, we were lucky."

"Director Kim, I'm really sorry."
"Director Kim, I'm really sorry."
"But, today I have an important engagement."
But you've come all this way...
You didn't tell me about this trip.
You know I've never said 'no' to whatever you asked.
This is really tough.
Does it have to be today?
I wouldn't have asked unless I was having a hard time.
And I absolutely have to start writing.
Are you really having a hard time?
Think I want to go on a picnic or something?
"No, I know you have to write."
You just stay one night.
I'll stay behind and write the script.
"Let's eat some sushi, have fun, and you can come back."
Only you can do that.
This was just after you escaped from the Hunters in Afghanistan.
"You're not suicidal, Flynn."
You're angry.
The Hunters did something to you.
"And until you face it, find out what really happened, it will kill you."
So who cares?
Emme does.
You're all she has now.
"Don't let the Hunters take everything away from her, too."
How was Karp?
His shipment's arrived.
I've got everything we needed from him.
What's the status on the reversion?
One of Sterling's solutions was successful.
You've been observing Sterling.
Can you replicate the process?
Can you replicate the process without him?
- Yes.
- Then you know what comes next.
It's all here?
Something so huge contained in these notes.
Incredible.
The incredible thing is our species working together.
"In a few days, I have accomplished what no other human scientist could even dream of."
Imagine what we can learn from one another.
Humans would never accept us.
They see us as monsters.
"You're not monsters, not to me."
Not anymore.
You're just trapped in a skin that doesn't fit you.
"In a world that just doesn't understand you, but people can change."
Many ended up lying on the street covered in blood.
"In Australia, over a hundred soldiers had to..."
I don't think they'll buy it.
When do you think it'll get sold?
"It would be a miracle, it's been so long..."
Don't you get bored?
No.
Can you come tonight?
Ok...
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Ok, see you later..."
Bye.
"Good evening, and welcome to the Bombay the next song is one of my favorites I hope you like it."
Thanks... and now a song dedicated by La Loba
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is the spirit... and woman, right?"
She applies the real Ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need, you owe, you have to pay, I saw, I liked, I want, buy it and you are screwed."
You can't do anything about it.
"It's like when we ask forthe dinner, right?"
"We are tired and we ask how is it going How was your day, honey?"
And they are always grouchy.
- Do you really want to know?
No man!
"It's hard to deal with them every day but it's life's circle; in which we have to live and exist, don't you think, Miss?"

Our Emperor wishes to give you a chance to serve the Han.
"He requests you send 1 0,000 soldiers."
This is an opportunity to show your allegiance... and restore our estranged friendship.
We know what His Majesty is like.
He'll never send reinforcements.
I agree.
But he still hasn't given an answer.
He usually does immediately.
Maybe he has different plans.
"(Jinyong, Tax Minister) I doubt it."
It's probably because of the recent trade issue.
He's worried refusing the demand might lead to another salt scare.
- Chief General.
- Yes?
"Can we afford to send 1 0,000 soldiers?"
Not from the city and the borders... but there will be no problem if we send the Sachooldo soldiers.
"(Heukchi, Chief General) The King knows that."
Prime Minister.
What can we gain from sending reinforcements?
It could solve the trade issue.
We could even demand steel weapons.
Why don't we demand they arm our men and pay for their expenditures?
"(Bulgae, Court Minister) That's a great idea."
But I doubt they will comply.
We must wonder... whether the Han can win the war as Yangjung says they will.
We mustn't send men to a losing battle.
Did you check up on them?
Yes.
The subjects are still discussing whether they should comply or not.
They can discuss all they want but isn't it up to King Kumwa?
- Dongsun.
"- Yes, Governor."
Frank Gallo left a message for you a few minutes ago.
- What did he say?
"- He said you and Mike better not be trying to screw him over again, or you're gonna regret it."
"Harvey, what's he talking about?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out."
♪♪
What the hell are you doing with Frank Gallo?
Harvey...
Don't pretend like you don't know.
He just left me a message asking me to make sure that you don't fu... him over.
"I told you, I'm working on a Brooklyn Housing Authority case."
Gallo is from Brooklyn.
He knows people.
And don't tell me he's making you pay for his information.
"Yes, he is, and I'm gonna pay him."
"Mike, odds are he doesn't know jack shit and he's just using you to get money."
"No, I looked into it, all right?"
What he told me checks out.
He's on the right side of this thing.
You're telling me he's all of a sudden Mother Teresa?
- This guy tried to kill you!
- I know that.
"Look, I'm not saying he's a saint."
I'm saying that I know what I'm doing.
Don't you get it?
A guy like Gallo finds people to get revenge on.
"He thinks about it and thinks about it, and the only way to survive that is to stay out of his mind and let him find someone else."
"Maybe you're right, but I already promised him something for his information, and if I back out of that now,"
I'm gonna end up on the top of his list.
Does Rachel know about this?

- No.
"Thank you, brother Hung."
Don't mention it.

My master is really great.
Please ask the candidates for the jury to come for the election.
"Mr. Cheung Ti-sung, you are handicapped,"
I would like to dispense you from serving the jury.
Objection!
Why do you object?
It's against the spirit of law for despising handicapped people.
"Although I am blind,"
I am always a righteous and fair person.
My wish is to become a jury member.
"If you don't let me join the jury, I'll complain against you."
"Alright, I'll let you do it."
Thank you.
"We have jury and judge here, actually, who will be in-charge of the court?"
Yup.
"So, do you think that is an answer?"
Well.
Prosecutor.
Jury.
"In the coming few days,"
I'll disclose the most ugly face of human beings in front of you.
This is a terrifying and shameless homicide.
The accused Ho Foon had secret affair with the victim's wife Yuk.
"He seduced the victim's wife, and he was well-planned to possess Yuk too."
He asked Ho Chun to meet him and then killed him.
"You shouldn't feel bad about that because, people will thank you."
- H i Brian.
- What?
"You know I was thinking, this whole thing with the gun and all..."
it would really make an important article for the paper.
"So, I was thinking that you and I should do an interview sometime."
"You know, just to let people know what really happened."
Maybe sometime after school.
What do you think?
What?
See you later.
Has the threat of violence changed the quality of my life at school?
"No, not really."
What do you mean?
I just don't see the point in talking about it.
Sometimes talking itself makes people feel better.
And sometimes talking gets people into trouble.
People say things about people and it doesn't always mean it's true.
You mean about who might be carrying a gun?
- About anything.
- Any weapon?
No.
J ust about anything anybody says about people.
It's not always true.
I just think people want to believe things about people...
so they decide certain things are true and they don't even ask.
And it's not fair.
Because you have to live with it anyway.
"But if it's not true the person could always say that, couldn't they?"
I think if something is false...
people aren't going to keep on believing it.
Usually people latch on to things when there is a kernel of truth.
They will have to destroy the evidence.
"And that, I'm afraid, includes us."
I don't think I feel very well.
I hope nothing's been broken.
So do I.
It's still on the Ortega.
We've got to get back to them.
Now I know I don't feel very well.
"If we could get back onto the flight deck, how long would it take to finish repairs?"
No time at all.
It's virtually all done.
"In flight we'd stand some sort of chance, like this we're a sitting target."
We would have to burn through the flight deck door.
"And if we did, she's armed, remember."
She could still hold us off.
Then we have to get her to come out.
Well she's hardly likely to do that.
Oh yes she is.
- Visual.
- Confirmed.
"There, there she is."
How long before we're in teleport range?
23.16 minutes.
"We're getting another reading, look!"
Another ship.
It must be coming to collect the neutrotope.
"Zen, can we get there first?"
Liberator will be in teleport range 3 minutes before the unidentified ship makes contact with the Ortega.
[MUFFLED LASER BLASTS AND SCREAMING]
"You'd better get her out of here, I really rather enjoyed that."
Teleport range will be achieved in one minute.
"Come on, Vila."
"Up to now, all I really found are things."
"Wonderful things, sir?"
Yes.
But nothing written.
No papyrus.
"If I went to your house, walked through each room, how much would I actually learn about you just from looking at your possessions?"
"Not much, I think."
"But if I read your diary, came across some household bills, found letters that had been written to you, then, I think, I'd begin to understand who you really were."
"Well, I think my wife might have something to say about you wandering about her house and rummaging around, sir."
"Yes, I expect she might."
"Well, I'll say good night."
"Good night, sir."
(Operatic music playing)
"Evening, Carter."
"Sorry, door was unlocked."
Let myself in.
I thought you'd be here sooner.
- Helped myself to a drink.
Hope you don't mind.
- Of course not.
What can I do for you?
Why don't you pour yourself a drink first?
What's the problem?
I gather Hauser and Hall have resigned and are leaving?
"Yes, I believe so."
"With Gardiner, that makes a third of our team who've walked out."
So?
Gardiner's a personal friend of mine.
He's one of the finest brains in England.
He came here at his own expense as a personal favour to me.
"Hauser and Hall, as you well know, are here courtesy of the Metropolitan."
I had a call this morning from New York.
"I'm taking a piss, asshole!"
- Yeah.
- Yo!
I'm not joining the mile-high club with you.
What about the really high club?
- Are you retarded?
- No.
You brought weed on the fucking airplane?
- Yep.
- What the fuck?
Wait a second.
You were giving that security guard shit.
Yeah.
How else was I supposed to get past him?
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?
- Look--What are you doing?
What is this?
- You'll see.
"Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you to an invention of mine."
Meet the smokeless bong.
- You made this?
"- You know, I did."
When you were slaving away at work...
I was actually being a productive member of society.
"- Yeah, that's really productive."
- Let me show you how it works.
"So you take a little weed... put it in the bowl right here and light it just like a normal bong, OK?"
Now here's the truly genius part.
"Inside this mechanism, I have actually made a little tiny, tiny fan... and some disinfectant powder, OK, it works sort of like a deodorizer... so that anything it expunges smells like Lysol."
- Put it away.
"- No, dude."
Can you not wait till we get to Amsterdam?

"I know there is a glitch with my copter, too, but at least I had it under control."

I find our Chief quite competent.
There's much he can teach us about this law enforcement procedures.
The humans do have strange ways.
But that's what makes them so interesting.

You can't leave.
You're our leader.
"Then, we'll all go."

We'll never belong here.

I can't just stand back and do nothing.
"Kyle, do I detect defiance?"
Genius joins the dark side.
I've got a list of rules I've been dying for you to break.
I don't want to break any rules.
I won't have to.
I'll do exactly what Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.
"Atta boy, Kyle."
Take a stand.
Why are your feet on my bed?
There were still ways to contact Amanda without seeing or speaking to her.
* I miss
* Feeling you there by my side... *
I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom without leaving my own house.
But it seemed she could find ways to thwart me just as easily.
"If electronic messages weren't getting through, there would be no way for me to send a note or a letter without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it."
I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
The written word was no longer an option.
But there were still a few notes I could send her way.
"I hoped this message would get through, and she would at least know I was thinking about her."
I was just trying- I know what you were doing.
I think you better come in now.
What?
"You want my music now, too?"
You've already confiscated my phone and my computer.
I know this is hard for you to understand-
That you're keeping me prisoner?
"All right, I'll be right there."
What is it?
A blue vest.
Thenit's time to go.
What happened?
He was wearing military boots like the Mokra.
It was a trap.
A trap?
And you saw it?
My clever girl.
We'll be all right.
We have each other.
Thas all we'll need.
Is not that simple.
We can't just walk into the prison without weapons.
Maybe we'll have to try a different strategy.
We don't have to ask your friend any more questions if you give us the answers.
"I told you, I don't..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
I always assumed that Vulcans didn't feel pain like the rest of us;
that you were able to block it out somehow until I heard...
Was that you I heard?
Vulcans are capable of suppressing certain levels of physical pain.
"Beyond that, we must simply endure the experience."
How can you say that so calmly?
You must feel some anger at what they did to you... some desire to fight back.
"Under the circumstances, physical resistance is ineffective."
We are...fighting back by refusing to give them any information.
Get down there!
Three more hours.
There's nothing going on around here.
"It's ""maybe""."
Directive is now required.
"Jenna, stand by to feed all power through to the main drive when the force wall is down."
Ready.
"Gan, deactivate the force wall."
Deactivating.
Why?
For what reason?
Perhaps Sonheim was still trying to cover up.
Mandrian knew about him and threatened to expose him.
Or perhaps he went into the filter plant while Sonheim was sabotaging the equipment?
But why damage the filter?
What possible reason could he have for delaying the flight still further?
How bad is it?
The damage was minor.
I've got Levett working on it.
We've locked him in the storage hold.
He seems quiet enough.
Has he said anything more?
Nothing new.
"He claims he went in and found Mandrian dead, picked up the knife, that's where I came in."
He still says he didn't kill him.
I believe him.
But I saw him with a dagger in his hand!
But you didn't see him use it.
"I didn't see Mandrian die either, but I know he's dead."
I've just spent the last ten minutes in the filter plant looking for something that should be there but isn't.
The cable that was damaged carries a high energy charge.
"In order to cut it, he would need a laser knife or an insulated saw."
Neither of which were there.
"Then, somebody else was the saboteur?"
Yes.
"But you know, you know how men do."
"You know, a lot of men don't get their stuff together until they 50, you know?"
You know.
You know what I'm saying?
They go back to school.
"Now they want to get their degree and shit, and the wife's sitting there like,"
"""Now you wanna do it, nigga?"
"""You wanna do that shit now?"
"""I done been telling your ass for 20 years."
"You wanna do that shit now?"""
"My pop is cool, man."
I just think that sometimes he puts blame on other people for his shortcomings.
"Which is cool, you know?"
We all do it.
"Like, every time I go home and he has a bad day he's like,"
"""Ugh."""
"I was like, ""Dad, what's wrong?"""
"""These crackers keep holding me down, son."""
"I said, ""Daddy, the crackers ain't holding you down."""
"""That associate's degree is holding you down."
"""Maybe you need to go to school a couple more years and upgrade."""
"'Cause an associate's degree is basically like the college saying,"
"""Yeah, we associate with you."
"We just don't fuck with you,"" you know what I'm saying?"
"It's real stuff, man."
But it's about the parenting.
Okay?
"You ain't gotta whup your kids, you know?"
"Change your personality, scare the hell out of them."
That's what it's about.
"It's about scaring them, putting that fear in 'em."
You ever ran away from your damn mom or your dad in the mall?
I wanna kiss you more than anyone in the world.
I wanna kiss you 1000 times.
I never wanna stop.
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.
What would Allison say?
Why bring her name up at a time like this?
Only one kiss to a customer.
"Betty, I couldn't help it."
My father made me call you.
Wouldn't you rather be with me?
"- Oh, yes, yes."
- Tell me how much.
"In the whole world, in the whole wide world there's nobody I'd rather be with than you, Betty."
Give me another kiss.
"Oh, honey, honey."
- You want to make love to me?
"- Yes, yes, of course I want to."
Now go make love to Allison MacKenzie!
Go get the girl you brought and try it with her.

And maybe Peyton Place High School isn't a name that shakes the world but it's a part of each of you forever.
Make it great by honoring it and come back to see us whenever you can.
Now let's form a big circle everyone holding hands.
"It's an odd feeling, being in a school when it's so quiet."
"Yes, to show what I imagined to be the essence of Britain..."
A sort of orthogonality which isn't british at all...
But which could be...
It could be...
With this wall containing these trees...
With this way of...
"This very british shyness, this very british grayness..."
"This calmness, this british distance..."
"This big distance, so gentle and british."
Eminently british.
I'm quite proud of this one.
It's a break-up picture.
"It was taken in Venice, in rather dramatic circumstances."
"It's the suit, tie and shoes of a man I loved."
In an apartment in Venice where we stayed.
"My shoes nearby, not at all aligned with his."
"That still aren't aligned, even less than before."
That are the only element of disorder in the picture.
And this colored shade...
It's a picture I sent him as a break-up letter in a way.
An ironic picture also.
Don't you think so?
Ironic?
I don't know.
This one is strange...
I don't like it very much...
It's a field in Corsica with...
A superimposed man in a bed in Aix-en-Provence...
The whole thing re-worked in Paris...
Already stained by humidity and weather.
It's a juxtaposition of a man...
Here below is a man in his bed...
Not me.
Where were you on Thursday?
- On a date.
- With who?
I didn't catch her name.
But she wasn't as hot as you.
"Holt's blood is on the victim, he's got priors and his alibi is just as worthless as he is."
"In other words, Mr. Holt just became our prime suspect."
Now all we have to do is shore up motive.
I've been working on that.
"So far, I haven't been able to find a single connection between him and Nelson."
And I doubt u will.
Ribosomal analysis shows that the sample of Johnny Holt's blood that we found on our vic is at least three months old.
While he was still in Sing Sing.
Sid found the dried blood on Nelson's throat.
Said he must've been hit there with a pipe or club.
The blood must've been on the murder weapon.
Transferred onto Nelson when he was killed.
I think we just found our connection.
No.
I've never seen him.
Are you sure?
He might've been an acquaintance of your husband's?
Absolutely not.
What about this boy?
I don't recognize this child at all.
"And to save you a question, I have no idea what these pictures are doing on Vince's computer."
Ever since this e-mail thing came out the phone's been ringing nonstop.
Someone put a pile of dog feces on my doormat this morning.
"Mrs. Nelson, did your husband teach anywhe else where he might've been in contact with younger boys?"
After school program?
The local Y?
You father told you that I wrote the encryption in these documents.
"Now, the part that you can't decipher confirms the existence of a man who wanted to turn over the spies to the USSR."
There was one man responsible for having the Russians killed?
Yes.
One man behind the entire frame-up?
Who is he?
I have no idea.
Doesn't specify a name.
I'd tell you if I knew.
"(Dozer) Okay, these are the photographs that make up the collage."
But this is the one I'd say we should be interested in.
How come?
Because this is Chameleon.
(Angela) Chameleon?
The assassin?
"Yeah, I remembered what you'd said about Walker's death looking professional."
So I ran this picture through the database.
Watch.
It's a match.
She's called Chameleon because she can transform into anyone she wants.
(Angela) I've seen her.
She was at the gallery on opening night.
She must have gone there to threaten Gus into stealing his art back.
"And once she got her hands on that piece and the negatives, she killed him."
Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
"Well, she's pacing."
That can't be good.
Would Chameleon really kill Walker just for catching her on film?
You think there's something else?
There has to be.
Such as?
It's no sense feeling shitty about it...
What can i...?
You know... that doesn't change the truth to what the fuck happened.
So fuck it.
"On the Marquis outside on the first, they say the show has been cancelled."
"Then, let's get a straight story for the press so it's not turning to what it isn't."
Then I think it should be the truth.
Absolutely.
He's got the end of his fucking finger cut off...
"Yes, absolutely."
He tried to do the show and passed out backstage.
We can't do the show.
"Thank you, that's fine."
I just need to hear it one more time.
"Well, there's nothing like another stressful day."
It sucked.
Keep rolling.
We will leave.
If we don't have a show tonight in 4 hours...
Ok?
And it doesn't matter if we run it or not.
"Everyone is gonna be fired, ok?"
We run it manual or we cancel it?
A or B choice.
What does that mean?
"For the show we do this week, we have no lights at all"
"We have house lights, we'll have to do with house lights."
"Well, that's not good enough."
Why are we in this position ?
The production is always be aware of exactly where...
"Well, the 2 guys who make the decision are me and me."
I am not aware until right now that the lights are not ready to be performed.
But they took her.
-Do you know where she is?
- She's a prisoner underground at the Base of Dulce.
And they have been torturing her.
- So the telepathic link between the two of you is how they tracked you?
-Yes.
-Look... uh...
I have no idea what you must be going through right now.
You never told me her name.
-Her name is Alyssa.
And she carries my child.
- I've been an associate of Chayton's since the early 90's.
He's devoted his life to researching anomalous phenomenon has established a strong following in the UFO arena.
"He was one of the first to get hold of the secret flying disk file of the FBI and sensitive documents from the CIA, air force, army and other government agencies."
"The price he's paid for being the truth to the public are death threats, imprisonment and getting shot at."
"He is a good man, and I trust him as I would a brother."
"- Thanks a lot, Derek."
I appreciate it.
Can you give us a moment?
"You don't know how good it is to see you, my friend Chayton."
-Likewise.
You look good.
-I'm a lot better than I feel.
Uh... this is the gentleman I was telling you about.
Jaelen.
-Welcome.
-I'm gonna show him the footage.
-Why don't we start with your name?
-Jaelen.
-Jaelen?
"So, Jaelen, who are you?"
- Our task was to monitor human conditions.
You like scotch?
I do.
Here.
Cheers.
"We're both healers, you and me."
We help people end their suffering.
Give them a moment of euphoria and take away their pain.
"I thought he just wanted to sell them pain relief, you know?"
"Weed, morphine."
I guess he saw an opportunity.
To kill people?
Must be an entrepreneurial genius.
"Well, if you think about it, he... he is."
"I mean, apparently, people are willing to pay top dollar for a good death."
"You know, it's true, what you said."
You never forget your first injection.
Mine was Yvonne.
ALS.
You know what that is?
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
"You shouldn't underestimate me, Mary."
Yet you didn't... you didn't think to mention any of this when we were in this very room together.
"Okay, you see, the way I saw it, I had two options."
One was to tell the police...
tell you that I'm a drug addict.
"Two, wear the wire, and I could prove that"
Mary and I are just ordinary end-of-life counselors.
"You lose all control, limb by limb, organ by organ... until you can't breathe."
Is that where you come in?
To take back control?
Or else the monster wins.
You said that was saline.
Why did you inform him?
We didn't inform
-Kanmani  Senthil informed them
-Fortunately nothing happened to MLA
-Else it could have been a big problem
-MLA died
-What are you saying?
"When I dragged his body itself, his pulse stopped"
God is helping me in some form Nothing will happen to me
You may go
"Tirupathi, don't worry"
- I will arrange for bail through our company's advocate
- OK
"Balakrishnan, I am Ramasamy speaking"

In their caste do they bury or cremate?
They will cremate

Go home and get 40000 Rs 40000 Rs?
Whose money it is?
Am I working as a gold smith in Coimbatore..
..or printing counterfeit currencies?
Let him stay behind bars for 1 year Let us see if he reforms
Are you all dumb?
"Yes, I am."
Recognize him?
"No, I don't."
I recognize him.
He was one of those Heng-In soldiers we met during a weapons trade the last time.
Why would they want to hurt me?
"Even if it were for revenge, it's impossible for Heng-In troops to attack the fleet."
Doing so would spell disaster for diplomacy between our country and theirs.
Why are you the only one back?
We were defeated by the guards.
WHAT?
!
YOU USELESS FOOL!
Of all things...
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
I want all the troops assembled at once.
"Yes, sir."
Damn it!
Any news?
The commander who represented Heng-In during that transaction was a man called Bae-Mang.
He defied orders and tried to embezzle the gold and weaponry that was to be used in exchange for our goods.
"His act was brought to light, and he was stripped of his position."
He then gathered a group of followers and renegaded.
A renegade?
You're saying those people after Miss are outlaws?
Yes.
I should have killed them all when I had the chance.
That's not all.
"They might be outlaws, but they were also soldiers and officers trained in the Heng-In Military."
"They will be well-trained, and battle hardy."
This is bad.
We cannot match their calibre.
I don't hate you.
It's not possible to hate you.
You're...
What the hell was it that Reynolds called you the other day?
Groovy.
You're a groovy chick.
"No, what I, um, do detest is your selfishness."
I have served this nation without regard for personal income for over ten years.
You are selfish because you want to take on a job that positions you to assume... a mantle of gigantic responsibility... and you do it full well with the knowledge...
Of what?
What?
"Greatness is the orphan of urgency, Laine."
Greatness only emerges when we need it most... in times of war or calamity.
I can't ask somebody to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.
They were men created by their times.
What I can ask for is the promise of greatness.
"And that, Madam Senator... you don't have."
"Well, then..."
"I just wouldn't be using sex as leverage... if I were you, Sheldon."
Because there's one thing you don't want.
It's a woman with her finger on the button who isn't getting laid.
Will that be the argument the senator offers up before the committee?
Sir?
Can I get you something to drink?
"- Uh, no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
- You sure?
"No, great."
Thanks a lot.
"- Ah, Mr. Webster."
- Mr. President.
- Good to see you.
Or maybe it was the day before that.
"No, I didn't pick up, what for?"
"The end means the end, it's pathetic."
What were you expecting?
Just forget about it.
"Yeah, forget about it and leave me alone."
You bother me about it everyday.
"I'm going to have to change my number, not because of him but because of you."
I can't not pick up your calls.
Maybe you don't want to cut yourself off from him completely.
Right?
"Fine, I'll change it."
Has Young Soo's movie made its premiere?
I thought it was supposed to be released around this time.
It premiered about a week ago.
Really?
That bastard was born to throw my money down the drain.
What's with the 'bastard'?
What of it?
You don't call your own child a bastard.
Mothers use it to refer to their children.
Why are you picking a fight?
Even my mother called me a bastard.
Is something causing you pain?
- Me?
- Yeah.
"Why do you look so glum, as if you've eaten something rotten."
And you haven't said one word unless it was in answer to something.
"He has no reason to gossip with you at a place like this,"
- why are you being like this?
- Why are you being like this?
You look uncomfortable.
Thanks again for leaving the Earl for me.
"Oh, well, there are dozens of royals, but I only have one sister, and there'll be other men."
Please tell me sex is better than caviar.
They're both better with vodka.
"But if I could offer a piece of big sister advice, when it comes to men, be patient."
You may have to kiss a lot frogs before you find your prince.
Pardon me.
Or not.
I believe you left your boot wheel behind.
"Oh, Joy, it's like Cinderella."
"Oh, sweetie, I don't think he's here for me."
"Yes, while you're both extremely charming women..."
- you don't have to.
- Right.
"I thought it was very lovely the way you left the party early to take care of your sister, but I wanted to get to know you better."
Would you consider joining me for a drink?
I'd love to.
"Ooh, would you give me a minute?"
- I'll meet you by the car.
- Of course.
"""What a bizarre house, it even doesn't have a bell!"""

Previously on Remedy...
Come to Dallas with me.
Wish I could say the same.
Not while you're pointing a gun at me or trying to.
"Well, no, you're an invisible guy with a sword."
I think you might have the advantage over me.
My point exactly.
"So what happened to you, James?"
What happened?
"I mean, I know we had our differences"
And I know Carol... happened.
"You always had your own ideas,"
Your own objections to warehouse policy.
"But, I mean, James, James--killing people."
When did you turn into that?
"I woke up, Arthur."
Ah.
Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic's iron hand
"And your neuroses,"
I could see the world more clearly.
"Yeah, well, you know, that's a little pathetic,"
"Isn't it, James, blaming everybody else but yourself?"
I don't think you found clarity.
I don't think your ego could stand the light.
I'd love to discuss this with you at length.
You or one of your new agents.
"Lattimer and Bering, right?"
I've been observing them for some time.
"I see they have potential, but they're so raw,"
"So untrained, so corruptible."
"If you come anywhere near them, I promise you--"
"I promise you, James, that you're going to regret it."
You'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I'm alive!

Are you doing a good job?
I want the bathroom spotless.
"Yes, mistress."
Spotless!
No slacking!
"Yes, mistress."
"Thank you, mistress."
I was always very dominant.
But it's not that I try to impose my will on other people.
That's not at all who I am.
I respect other people.
"For me, it's very important to respect people."
But I enjoy it and...
I like that when I say something.
it'll be done.
I absolutely adore my love slave.
And the opposite is also true:
He worships me.
I doesn't affect our love - on the contrary.
"The point is, we have cut off their troops communications, and we've put our own troops on the ground."
"So as soon as the centurions retrieve the Eye, you can take out Galactica."
"Okay, here's the deal."
We're out of options.
"The cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party."
"So I've divided you into two teams, okay ?"
Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp.
Team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines.
"I know that's not glamorous work, but we gonna need the extra firepower in case the cylons decide to take a shot at us."
"Look, I know some of you are scared."
"And that's okay, 'cause"
I'm scared too.
"But if we keep our heads, and we do our jobs, we can do this."
We can all get out of here in one piece.
And Berley has a list of your names and your assignments.
Make sure you get with her.
See you outside.
That was good.
Honest.
You'd make a good officer.
"An officer, huh ?"
Like you.
"Someone who swears an oath, and knows how to keep it ?"
I'm not really sure
- what you think is going on...
"- Don't insult me, okay ?"
I'm not stupid.
I know my wife.
I know how she is.
We been married for a year and a half.
"What, do you think you're the first ?"
I chose to marry Kara.
I'm going to tell her we can't make it.
"Oh, no."
You have to go.
I don't understand.
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.
And we're going to use that to our advantage.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp."

Virginia on January 23rd.
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
"Anything relevant they have from that date, I want."
"Tell them it's for Stan Beeman, and I have code-word clearance for the project."
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect the call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want, and you wind up --"
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the KGB right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
!
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
- Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
- You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
You were saving that money to go to Europe.
"Oh, yes."
The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste entire regions.
An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible.
You did it didn't you?
They wants you to go for it!
"Wow, Marcus!"
"They wants you to get a hold of the ark before the Nazis do, and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it."
And the museum?
The museum gets the ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
"You know, five years ago I would have gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Will she still be with him?
Possibly.
"Marion is the least of your worries right now, believe me Indy."
What do you mean?
"Well, I mean, for nearly three thousand years, man has been searching for the lost Ark."
That's not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
"Oh, Marcus, what are you trying to do, Scare me?"
You sound like my mother.
We've known each other for a long time -
"I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus."
I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You're talking about the boogie-man.
"Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am."
It gets worse as you try to fix it.
I will absolutely fix it.
I got into college.
finally managed to get out of the examination hell.
Made up my mind.
absolutely no studying during this summer vacation.
"I've got plenty of time to fix this organ, absolutely...."
"Here we go again with Tateo's ""absolutely."" You said it three times already."
A letter from Hawaii.
Pictures are enclosed.
Let's see.
"""I hasten to inform you that we were met..."

Dad has a lei.
"""We knew that Suzujiro's deceased wife was an American..."
"""but were somewhat surprised to find..."
"""that all the family members were 100 percent Americans."""
Terrific!
This is a cadillac limousine!
"His son clark and wife, natalie... and their children michael and emily."
This michael and emily look like they are just about our age.
"And emily, she's a very beautiful girl."
"-Tateo, are you falling for her?"
-Stupid!
"""But all of them speak broken Japanese, which set our minds at ease."""
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with english.
"""After a comfortable drive of about 20 minutes..."

"""immediately we met Suzujiro, who was sick in bed."""
Is he Grandma's elder brother?
"""Suzujiro looked better than we had anticipated."
You had to wash them all by hand when you got back from the tour?
"Like, really big bugs."
We're talking 30 pounds worth.
That's how much more the costumes weighed when you came back.
See?
Here on the bills of lading.
"Uh, we bought a couple of costumes."
"Mimi, don't you think we would have checked that out before we brought you in?"
"What you did, Mimi, was you bought a few bricks of coke in South America."
"And you dissolved them in water, and then you dipped the costumes in them."
"And then when you got back, you soaked the costumes, and then you let the water evaporate, and, bingo!"
Cocaine.
"Oh, god, oh, god."
"Oh, god, oh, god, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, me and George, we've been trying to get a down payment on a place, so George had a friend who knows some people in Iman..."
"All right, yeah."
Did Laura know what you were doing?
"Oh, my god."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Nobody knew.
"Mimi, she had coke all over her hands when we found her."
She must have grabbed onto one of the costumes
- when she was hiding in the racks.
- Hiding?
"Yeah, she was hiding back there with Maestro Reinhardt, ""Fearsome Phil""."
"They were, they were having some kind of a fight about something."
What were they talking about?
"He was yelling it was his decision, he decides."
"And then he just yelled at us, and then he left."
And what about Laura?
"She came out right after that, and she looked really upset."
"- No, no, no."
"Go ahead and take him, and I'll do my best to be there, okay?"
Just come back safely.
I will.
Bye.
"Everybody, meet agent Prentiss."
The other day.
I've been filling her in on protocol.
- Derek Morgan.
- Emily Prentiss.
We can make nice later.
What do we know?
"The DEA raided what they thought was a hardened meth lab right here, in Northern Virginia, but they found this instead."
That could be a dispersal device for a chemical weapon.
- Sophisticated.
- Homeland security's thinking Al Qaeda.
"They've developed devices that span the spectrum of sophistication, some as simple as soda bottles and paint cans."
They're called al ikhteraa.
"Literally ""the invention""."
They are.
Do we know what the biological or chemical agent is yet?
"No, not yet."
The cell members bailed out through a tunnel.
The DEA recovered a nextel 2-way and managed to intercept a message.
- That's not the transcript.
It's...
"- No, it's in arabic."
Our friends surprised us and eloped.
We can no longer wait for the wedding as planned.
We can deliver our gift at the next crescent.
I lived in several middle-eastern countries

"Well, at least let me give you one of these whole-grain muffins."
"Oh, come on."
Think of chewing as an aerobic exercise.
Ugh... just holding this muffin is making me feel bloated.
Huh?
(munching)
"One man's trash, baby."
"One, two, three, four, their prices are low, but their morals are lower!"
"Well, once again, you're overreacting."
Overreacting gets results!
I am simply exercising my right to free speech.
"Uh-huh, and the rotten fruit?"
Visual aids.
"Hilda, I've made an appointment for you with the president of the Everything Emporium to sit down and discuss the matter, if you'd like to try the mature approach."
Fine.
I just hope I can return that cow manure.
What are the odds that the cafeteria would have the bacon cheeseburgers and chocolate sundaes on the same day?
"I know, it's like winning the lottery."
Did you misplace your entree?
No.
"I'm trying to lose weight, so I can fit in my new dress."
The dress that's going to make us a lock for King and Queen.
Good.
So we're both doing our part.
"What's yours, eating like Henry VIII?"
Don't pretend like you haven't noticed my mustache.
"Oh, I see it."
"No, that's just a shadow."
(low gurgling)
Does anyone else hear that strange buzzing sound?
Yes.
Like the low hum of an incoming B-52.
None of it's working.
"I had this guy leave me a voicemail at work, so I called him at home."
"And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry, and so I texted to his cell."
Then he e-mailed me to my home account and the whole thing just got out of control.
And I miss the days where you had one phone number and one answering machine.
And that one answering machine housed one cassette tape and that one cassette tape either had a message from the guy or it didn't.
And now you have to go around checking all these different portals just to get rejected by seven different technologies.
It's exhausting.
What about that MySpace guy?
- Jude.
I like him.
- Good.
"Yeah, I felt like we connected."
Great.
What if she wants you to kiss her?
"Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her."

[PHONE RINGS]
This babe has plenty of battle scars.
Hello?
"Oh, hey, you're home."
Where am I supposed to be?
"Out, maybe?"
It's Saturday night.
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me.
It's kind of limiting.
Right.
"Listen, I was just gonna leave a message."
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.
"Oh, I don't know."
Won't Conor be there?
"You are strong with the force, little one."
"Thank you, master."
"Thank you, master."
Master!
Revenge.
I must have revenge.
I can sense the darkness within you.
I will teach you the ways of the dark side.
But you must prove yourself first.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
"No, I will destroy the jedi."
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
And now you shall die.
Dooku.
[Exhales]
"You count on the salinity, the salt coming from the parmesan, or did you add additional salt?"
"I backed off the salt just a hair, because of the salt in the parmesan cheese, yes."
"(Gordon) Come on, Derrick."
(Derrick) I'm running out of time.
The only thing I can do is just keep looking at my oven and see how my souffles are doing.
"(Gordon) How long, Derrick?"
"Uh, momentarily."
One minute to go.
"(Derrick) They're rising, they look good, but they still need a little more time."
"(Gordon) Derrick, 30 seconds to go!"
(Announcer) Share the joy of cooking with your kids with cooking kits as seen on MasterChef.
These oven-ready kits are chef inspired for kids who cook by Kidsline.
One minute to go.
"(Announcer) Derrick is the only home cook to make a second batch of souffles, but with only seconds left, will his decision leave him with nothing to serve?"
Ay yi yi.
"- A neurosurgeon, one of the finest on staff."
- I want to speak to him.
"He's waiting for us, Mrs. Rickman."
I don't judge the living or the dead.
Antibus.
"I grant wishes, prayers and dreams."
Guardian of the gate.
Am I going to die?
This is Kingdom Hospital... which stands on uneasy ground.
"Here, the cold and damp have returned."
And as the gate swings open... the dead may also return.
"I'm going to give you a few moments alone with your husband now, if you'd like that."
- Would you like that?
- Yes.
"- I would like that, Doctor..."
- Hook.
"Now, you can speak to your husband, but... he will almost certainly not answer... although he may open his eyes."
Is he in a coma?
"He's not conscious or responsive now, but that is not unusual after trauma and surgery."
"Now, time may prove me wrong, but I don't expect him to be in a coma."
Is he awful?
No.
"You handled that brilliantly, Hook."
And thanks for putting him in the...
The Presidential Suite is what they call it up here.
Excuse me.
"I'll just let you handle this, then, shall I?"
Make one of the Kingdom apartments available to her... if that's appropriate.
There are lots of vacancies.
Peter?
Look at you.
Just look at you.
- Why?
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
Well... fuck you.
Next month I am going to buy the same ones but in red.
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
"I have to be with my family and besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
"I am leaving, see you next week."
Why so fast?
Let's go please.
Damn it!
- Tamales!
- What do you have?
- Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you want a sweet one?
"I don't have more money, but if you can give me credit until next time..."
Thank you.
"A ten month old baby died of an infection caused by rat bites in Colombia,"
The baby was malnourished and the authorities are questioning the mother she says that the baby's father left her alone with four kids.
The funeral of the ten year old girl murdered by a neighbor who wanted to eat her body in Oklahoma.
The victim's family and friends were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree...
Two criminals who decapitated two policemen in Mexico have not been caught yet.
"The heads were found... outside a govemment building with a note saying ""learn to respect""."
- Hey beautiful!
"- Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
Christopher!
"Cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma to the head, neck, chest."
It's consistent with an impact of over 100 miles an hour.
"Oh, it's like he never slowed down."
And the only silver lining is the death is likely instantaneous.
He didn't suffer.
PRIDE:
Possible he had a medical condition?
Heart attack?
Stroke?
He's awfully young.
"But I'll know more after the autopsy, and I'll do a tox screen for drugs and alcohol."
SEBASTIAN:
"Hey, boss."
"Oh, wait, nobody calls you ""boss,"""
do they?
It's too informal.
"I get it, it's no way to start a relationship."
"Sebastian, we're not starting a relationship, okay?"
We've known each other for years.
"Yeah, but not as employer and employee."
"That's a whole different dynamic, sir."
"""Sir"" doesn't sound right, either."
You sure about making this guy an agent?
"I find that hurtful, you know, right here."
"The case, Sebastian."
Right.
"Yeah, well, uh, it's really simple, I guess, at least on the surface."
"Car was going too fast, couldn't make the turn."
Don't really need fancy forensics to figure that part out.
Any signs of sabotage?
Not yet.
"Dude, you haven't done any of these yet."
I know!
But who cares?
I got all the time in the world.
"I mean, I'm only turning thirty."
Thirty?
No one's thirty.
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?
"So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs..."
Appendectomy?
Now that ain't right!
"Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia."
"Well, I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé instead of my wife tonight, but that ain't happening either, you know what I'm saying!"
?
"Tell you what, I'll think about it."
My appendectomy patient wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.
"Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, but that ain't gonna happen either."
Dr. Cox!
Dr. Cox!
No!
Awful!
Hypnosis is a very powerful tool.
It's helped people with depression and weight loss it helped me quit smoking.
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges.
"Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best:"
"Knock her out, and then start digging around inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel."
I think you should do it.
Knock her out and dig.
Do it.
Dig.
Do it.
Dig.
He was a good man.
He never did anything to you.
That's a dead body.
"Now, let me see."
That's an alien craft.
That's an alien craft?
Isn't it kind of small?
"The alien craft is about the size of a dinner plate,"
Who ever told you that aliens need as much space as people?
"Well, that's really quite a world that you showed me."
You're a scientist as tall as the empire state building.
and the aliens are as big as...
Jumbo shrimp.
I've available no other world to show you.
"Well, isn't it possible that that might be a child's toy?"
And not a UFO?
"Don't worry, forget it..."
"We'll leave this fucking place, baby, and we'll go to Berlin."
I wanna sing in the night clubs.
Germans love me...
We'll be happy.
What are we gonna do with this body?
Don't worry about the body...
"I know what to do, you wanna do it right now?"
Are you sure this has something to do with the UFO?
Looks like two women just killed a man.
This is not my first encounter with the aliens.
Just watch in the long run you will see what happens there.
Why don't they call the police?
Why don't we call the police?
They don't want the police to be involved.
Why?
"Same as you, admiring the bikinis."
"Well, I doubt you would have come to Quito just for that."
I also doubt you came for the same.
"You know that wherever there are beautiful women, I shall be there."
I'll buy you a drink.
Lets.
"And, tell me, Inspector, how did your ...."
You where saying?
"No, I have a prior engagement, I will see you later."
Did you have any problems?
"No, everything is rolling along, Ms. Bristol."
"Except for one thing, that girl, I have seen her somewhere else."
Which one?
The red head.
A member of the International Service?
"I do not know, but it is something we must find out."
"There is no time for that, there is but one solution."
"There is, we must not take any risks."
"Truly, I am having the best of luck."
This is my first night off.
What did you say your name was?
I didn't say.
"Well, it does not matter, a name is not that important."
It seems you do not like to waste any time.
Of course not.
Then what are you doing here?
you will accompish nothing here.
"Well, It will have to be enough to just admire the view."
I tought you would have been more daring.
"You are right, I am actually quite shy."
"Tell me, are you still free tonight?"
Of course!
"There's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy-hitter seems to be running the show."
We got them boxed in.
"Whatever it takes, I want it finished."
We have Westen.
Awaiting instructions.
Stand down and let him go.
Please confirm stand-down.
Confirmed.
All units stand down.
"I'll never stop, Westen."
I'll hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I have to.
Then I'll see you there.
"When you're a fugitive, it's tempting to flee the country and worry about the details later."
But it's also a great way to get caught.
"Since most countries now require biometric I.D.s, the first step in getting out of town is getting good documents."
You can't just go somewhere new.
You need to be someone new when you get there.
Randy Weems?
What the hell kind of name is that?
What happened to Chuck Finley?
That's my lucky name.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Weems, but my I.D. guy doesn't take requests."
"Oh, crap."
"Well, just stick with ""Sam,"" will you?"
Don't be calling me Randy until we leave.
"Speaking of leaving, shouldn't Elsa be here with the supplies already?"
Michael and Jesse are almost done with the radio.
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
I just gave her a few extra things to pick up for me.
She probably just got stuck shopping.
"""A few extra things""?"
"Mandrian came in, discovered whoever it was, and had to be silenced."
"The murderer then went out, taking the saw with him."
"Sonheim's story is true, he just happened to be the one to discover the body."
Then who did kill Mandrian?
The same person who killed Rafford and Dortmunn.
And I know who that is now.
You know?
Yes.
"I should have seen it right from the start, but my mind had conditioned itself to see the wrong thing."
As Cally has been saying all along.
You found the meaning?
Yes.
Just before he died Rafford managed to scrawl this out.
54124?
Precisely What's it mean?
Absolutely nothing.
"As a number it has no significance at all, but in the filter plant just now, I noticed one of the instruments."
"Liquid crystals show a number, then the confirmation circuit translates those numbers into the written word."
"From the start, we thought that those were numbers."
"They are not, they are letters."
Letters?
Rafford was dying.
It's difficult to be neat under those circumstances.
Let's start with the one and the two.
And the first letter.
So now you know.
"It doesn't matter, you'd have known soon enough anyway."
"Sara, why?"
I wanted the neutrotope
Or at least the money it would give me.
It's that simple.
Was Mandrian in it with you?
"Jesus Christ, Emma."
Now you listen to me.
While we were goofing around... another woman got murdered.
I am gonna get someone to take you home... and you stay there with the cop who's assigned to you.
Please don't palm me off on somebody else.
I have to talk to you.
I got to work on this full-time all the time.
Ridgely's a good cop.
He's gonna look after you.
"Is Ridgely gonna take over fucking me, too?"
Did you enjoy that?
What the hell am I to you... one of your little conquests?
I've seen your friends smirk at me.
You think I'm stupid?
What do you tell them?
You give them a full report?
Listen to me.
I'm a little bit busy right now... to be playing Romeo to your Juliet.
I have one or two minor things on my mind... not the least of which is finding this killer... before he finds you... so simmer down and stop acting... like some love-crazed teenager.
You are such a prick.
Emma...
I like you.
You're a very interesting... unusual woman.
You're so full of shit.
Don't you dare treat me like we just met in a bar.
"Well, we did, didn't we?"
Fuck!
"What do you want me to say, huh?"
You want me to say I love you?
Is that what you want?
Look at us.
You think we have some kind of future together... some kind of suburban bullshit?
"It'll be over in no time, just like your five years in college"
"Thanks to your foolishness, we've lost two chances"
Last chance!
Please give sensible suggestions
Remember!
I'm doing all this only for you.
"No one must know, okay?"
Shekhar needs cash.
Immediately.
- I'll sign up tomorrow
"What do you mean, you'll sign up?"
Aren't we going back?
But Om borrowed the money for my education
Out there you can earn lots more.
Just mail the money home
No American company will give me a loan.
"And Om wants cash, immediately"
This urgency was never the point.
The decision to borrow was his own
You knew nothing about it
And you're forgetting something.
Only a few weeks to go... before your work permit expires.
And you got to return before that
Is everything all right?
What was that about the work permit?
"It's nothing, Ma."
You haven't gone to bed yet?
Go to sleep
He must return to America before his work permit expires
"Jai, will you step outside for a minute?"
"Whatever you got to say, say it in front of Nitu"
Have you informed Om about this?
They have wounded me in such a way..
..that I wont be able to forgive them in this life!
Dont be so harsh on them!
If you wont support them in their bad times..
..then who else will support them?
And did you forget what sister-in-Iaw used to say?
The one who doesnt know how to forgive..
..even God doesnt forgive that person.
"Jyoti, even if God sends me to hell for not.."
"..forgiving them, then III happily go, but I.."
..I will not give them a place in..
..my heaven-Iike house again.
"If.. if I forgive them today, then all those brothers.."
..who take care of their younger brothers..
..like theirfatherwiII neverforgive me!
"Jyoti, its very simple."
If today these people have cried in orderto improve..
"..their bad times, then can you assure me that.."
"..in future, if the time changes.."
..these people wont change themselves?
Can you assure me about this!
?
No!
You cant assure me about this.
"Krishna, get these people out of here!"
Im feeling suffocated!
"One day, you promised me that.."
..you will never let these children cry.
"And today, when these children are.."
"..in front of you, you are feeling suffocated!"
Did you forget your promise!
?
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to Mendel's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are...
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
Although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"Suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
I always wonder about women who chase men who so obviously don't wanna get caught.
You ever ask yourself that about Gillian?
You're not being fair to her.
"Well, we heard that you hacked a statue into pieces during a rehearsal."
I don't censor myself during my creative process.
Wasn't it because Gillian got a line wrong?
I want to know why you brought me down here if I can't speak to him.
"It's been happening more often, lately, had..."
"Wait, I want to hear what my husband's saying."
"I'm afraid not, Ms. Booth."
Detective Logan's already stretching the rules having you in here at all.
But this just cruel.
And it's Mrs. Reinhardt.
"What do you say, captain?"
There's no secrets between husbands and wives.
That's correct.
No secrets.
"Actually, this is the report from the emergency room doctor who examined her."
It confirms what the police officer observed.
What doctor is she talking about?
Is this about Laura?
"No, it's the doctor who examined you in Queens."
You have no right to show him that.
No secrets.
That's what you said.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with her?
"Well, she has the same disease that killed her father and uncle."
This is a summary of their autopsies.
It describes pretty clearly the course of the disease.
How can you...
Don't show him that.
"Well, whenever i was in a fix, jim, i'd just try to figure out what you'd do."
I want to know.
"Trying to flatter me, eh?"
"Well, i was looking and listening around."
"About a year ago, i found out these smart boston bankers was swapping golr money."
Ney.
"$400 in gold was fetching $1,000 in greenbacks."
Sure.
Those bankers were on the inside track.
"They knew that when the war was over, the government would stand back of that paper money."
"Well, i says to myself, i says, ""jim fisk wouldn't stand by"
"""and watch that gold rot in that bank, would he?"
"""Of course he wouldn't."
"Why, jim fisk's smarter than any back-bay banker that ever banked!"""
"Wait a minute, wait a minute- you changed our gold to greenbacks?"
Uh-huh.
Jehoshaphat!
"Did i do right, jim?"
Did you do right?
It's more than $2 million!
$2 million?
We'll buy the stonington railroad!
2 million cartwheels!
Wait a minute- that ain't all.
Huh?
What?
"Well... when i got all this money together, it looked like an awful lot of greenbacks, so i said, ""what would jim think about this?"
"""Shucks, to a big man like him it'd look like a wad of lettuce."
"""Why, jim would say it's a sacrilegious crime to let that lettuce lay there and go to seed,"""
"so... well, i bought bonds."
Bonds?
Bonds?
We've got her!
She's coming around!
They've done it!
Let go of grappling irons.
All larboard guns to bear on the fire ship.
Fire!
The flagship's under way and into the fight.
The French are running back into port!
"Look there, sir!"
"- They're a good crew, sir."
"- Signal from the flagship, sir."
"Thank you, Defiant, for swift and honorable action."
"""Thank you for swift and honorable action."""
"No mutineers onboard this ship now, sir."
"Bring her about, Mr. Ponsonby."
- We join the squadron.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Stand by to go about!
"Thank you, Mr. Crawford."

And so I hope you'll find these estimate satisfactory.
"I personally had them prepared by our very ablest man,"
"Mister, uh, well, whoever it was."
"And as my late boss, good old Jess Devro, used to say,"
"""When you're sending in the A team with all the horses behind you..."""
"Well, you know the sort of thing he used to say, Lita."
Why do you supposed I wanted you to take this instead of just a secretary?
"Oh, who's trotting the estimates over to Phoenix?"
They ought to be there before the weekend.
"Clem Sandover, I believe."
What is she thinking?
"What are you laughing about, Lola?"
"Based on the script, Lola should now say..."
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and I accidentally laughed.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and couldn't help laughing.
That line is exactly what's in the script...
But the tone is completely different.
This jie jie is different from the script.
She's not gentle at all.
I'm sorry.
Such a murderous aura.
"The dialogue didn't change, but the mood is completely different."
She has totally overturned the character's personality concept.
Gong Xi jie is amazing.
"Next, in the script, Lola gently says,"
"""Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say... """
"Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say, you already know the answer in your heart."
"Then Lola will gently say,"
"""Daddy is human too. """
"""Sometimes he's irrational. """
Daddy is human too.
Sometimes he is irrational and unintentionally says hurtful things.
"Angel, you ought to know that parents don't resent their children."
"Angel, you ought to know that parents... do resent their children."
She changed the dialogue.
What is she doing?
Jie Jie is supposed to make Mei Mei realize that their dad loves her.
Why are you...?
Why is she pointing at me?
Why you rolling toward me?
You're in front of the door.
Uh...
Oh.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
What happened to you?
What happened was this:
The bee man was not composed of bees.
The drones nested around their queen  safe inside the bee man 's mouth.
But when he spat the queen  she signaled her drones to attack any perceived predator.
"Unlike Kentucky Fitz, Chuck kept a cool head and an open mouth."
She was not perceived as a predator  but a nest.
Look.
That's Betty Bee as a little girl.
"Well, either she was an unfortunately hairy child..."
Or Betty Bee is the terrifying bee man.
- Wasn't she with you?
- She didn't get off the elevator.
She must have come back up here to wiggity-whack you for being a spy.
Like she wiggity-whacked Kentucky.
"Well, my wiggity wasn't whacked."
And I got the bee key.
- That's a house key.
I know what house.
As Chuck followed the bee key that was key  Olive Snook followed her homesick heart to the confessional.
Congratulation ...
Sir.
Werner Heisenberg!
"Dont leave, wait for me please!"
Damn!
"370 wifes or mistresses, or anything else..."
They allways lead with that they dont lnow anything about physics.  but that it was interesting.
"""Culture and science, is Germanys great strenght"""
Then moving on to the weather and other unrelated stuff.
"For exmaple ""strategic withdraw"""
"We withdraw with success, and show ""victoriouse resistance""."
But i like you
I've allways liked you Wanted you to know that
You are not one of those that give up to easily
"Stay with me, I want to show you something."
Its not only you that have been busy!
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any ""hocus pocus"""
"Or what, It looks like this."
but we arent stopping there!
Extracted uranium.
What happens then?
look.
I had to do something easier than drop a bomb on them
Like for example put it in lube form.
A kind of cream
But it is very different.
"Effect and result, look."
For example number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
"Exposion of radiation, for several minutes."
Yeah.
Lindsay?
Thank you.
I'm sorry for disturbing you.
What's this about?
I'm afraid I've heard that you've been absent from work.
"I'm concerned that you're not coping and, if you were to get into trouble again, you'd return to prison."
- I'm never going back to prison.
- Mm.
But you can't afford to lose that job.
What did you expect for ten quid?
I was trying to help you.
20.
Don't you try making up any lies about this because it's all on video.
You can't do that!
It's illegal!
"You're saying that I can't record you without your prior knowledge, as a breach of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act?"
I'll take your Human Rights Act and I'll raise you Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and your offence under that act carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
I'll see you in court.
Where's Maneet?
"Off sick, I heard."
Some forensics I've asked her to chase up.
It'll just have to wait.
"Oh, Kate's got a postmortem report for you, if you're interested."
Thanks.
"Yeah, if you just get a couple of..."
You've got a new PM on Oliver Stephens-Lloyd?
Yeah.
Are you going to get round to telling me?
Yeah.
The new autopsy found significant differences from the original.
Both arms were broken and there was a severe skull fracture.
Ready.
Fire.
What the hell's going on?
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
They were opening a vortex.
They would've escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could've kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
"If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might've avoided a firefight."
"With all due respect, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
Archer to Major Hayes.
"Go ahead, Captain."
"Report to my ready room, on the double."
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as tactical officer.
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain...
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
Understood.
There's nothing more important than the success of this mission.
"-Do you agree, Major?"
"- Of course, ser."
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off the Supreme Court.
Laine Hanson is attractive.
She's a looker.
The mere fact that she was a Republican means that she can't be too far to the left.
It's a perfect pedigree.
We can't get you in by convincing him you're the right man for the job.
We have to convince him that she's wrong.
"Once we do that, you're in."
"And Toliver, he's as much as told me..."
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.
You won't have to.
We have to go after her.
We have to make her wade in her own blood.
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.
- Makerowitz.
- I'm sorry.
That doesn't mean much to me.
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive bill of Mr. Makerowitz.
Private citizen wants to do their own investigation...
What exactly are you trying to find out?
"Campaign irregularities, bribes?"
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
"- Yes, it is."
But the FBI would not find anything.
All of her money is tied up in blind trusts.
"The kind of improprieties you're talking about, I think that only helps her."
"Personally, I think the nation would be relieved to know that just because she's a woman..."
It's been a Iong time.
I can't remember all of it.
Do you understand the Iyrics?
"No, I simply learned it by heart."
I think it's a childrens song.
A lullaby...
My sister and I used to sing a song.
We had two versions.
One we sang to our mother.
About the countryside and flowers.
The other I made up with my sister.
We only sang it when we were alone.
It went something like:
"""My slut mother fucked a bishop... in Heaven, they ate a piano and two children..."""
It rhymed in Hungarian.
It was funny.
Why tell me about your childhood?
To entertain you.
"When he was told of his impending execution, he accepted it with resignation."
Like sort of a relief.
From confessing to all the crimes.
"The real ones, as well as those"
I think were products of his fantasy.
He was taken to the firing squad at dawn.
Among those present:
"his defense lawyer, the judge who sentenced him, a priest... although he didn't ask for one... and a firing squad of 10 soldiers."
Only half of them fired real bullets.
The others shot blanks.
"That way, no one knew who fired the fatal shot."
I was present at the firing of the rifles.
He collapsed onto the ground.
The squad leader approached him.
Who's got to come here.
He only wants to go to bed with you.
"Nobody, nobody fucks at the club, everybody's gay."
It's you who thinks about fucking all the time.
"Your vocabulary is punctuated to two words ""Shit"" and ""Fuck""."
What do you say I should say making love instead of fucking?
So what do you think?
Is that better professor?
I think you look like a hooker.
And you act like a hooker.
You'll end up in a hospital with some horrible sexual disease.
"You don't understand, so I look like a hooker?"
So what?
You like it...
I know that you like it.
So why should I live these lies?
The way you want me to dress and behave is as a sweet housewife slave of her husband's will.
A hooker at least is independant ...nobody's victim.
"It's the only fair that I warn them, this pussy has teeth."
You're my best student.
I invested a lot of time in you.
What do you say?
We've spent most possible time in bed.
"You know, Adrian has turned you into a real mean bitch."
Every body says so.
Try to be nice.
What do you think?
Do you like this professor?
I think you look better in jeans that in a turtleneck.
"Yes, professor."
May I help you?
Yes...what side of the building do your windows face?
"Good luck, 'cause it was here when I moved in."
"So, what are you doing with this sofa?"
"I tried to give it to goodwill, but apparently, they have a too many stains policy."
I'm surprised they took your shirts.
"Samuel, it's yours if you want it."
"Uh, thank you, but my roommates and I have more of a southwestern motif."
"You know, now that you're moving in with Molly, we won't be able to hang out like this anymore."
What are you talking about?
You guys can come over there.
It's gonna be my place as much as it is hers.
Hmm.
"Yeah, that's what those Indians thought when they waved at that first boatload of pilgrims."
Exactly.
No more spearing fish and peeing in the woods.
It's tea cakes and Bible lessons for you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Those women are gonna civilize you.
"No more fingers up your nose, no hands down your pants, and forget about sitting on the couch, drinking from a can of pork and beans."
"Please, Carl, I'm not an animal."
I've lived indoors before.
Really?
"You want to lift these couch cushions and play food, filth or fungi?"
Tamale?
Frozen plantain.
I'll eat that.
See?
"Doesn't take up a lot of space, and it fits in with all your Asian decor."
Samsung.
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do with this?
Good question.
Where do you keep your bobbleheads?
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
Is there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
Not that I can think of.
Miss Lau has answered your questions.
I'd like to draw this to a close.
"Miss Lau, I did know your father well."
And you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't a man that scared easily but someone had him on the run.
"If you say so, Harry."
"Yet you - you seem completely unaffected through all of this, cool as a cucumber."
- Why is that?
- I don't like the direction you're taking this.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
"- Unless you charge my client, we are leaving."
- What did they promise you?
Miss Lau?
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
- What's that?
- What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
And you were there in the casino the night it happened.
He was just leaving.
"Do you ever make a decision that at the time seems sound, but quickly reveals itself to be empty?"
"Good-bye, Philip."
I don't like you.
He's kind of an asshole.
What a strange feeling.
"So off... it's like my head is a car, but I can't drive fast because there's too much traffic."
"So instead I'm just moving very, very slowly."
"It's so hard, what I do."
"I mean, it's not at all, and that is the joke, right?"
"- (SIGHS) God, this is so boring."
- A big joke.
Ashley's so bored right now.
Just go back where you came from.
"I'm getting angry at myself, do you understand?"
Because it doesn't even upset me to see you like this.
I want you to leave and leave me alone.
"I don't know why you are here, but I'm not interested, so don't tell me."
"God, do you remember there was a time when we just..."
"We wanted to go to sleep together and wake up together, every day, indefinitely."
Now I don't even give a shit if I ever see you again.
"I want you to leave, and just don't come back and stop hurting me."
I got asked to write a short story about photography.
By who?
"Oh, God, you'd be so mad if I told you."
Isn't that what you want?
I don't know what you want me to say.
You used to be so exciting.
Now you're just pitiful.
"(CLICKS TONGUE) I'm afraid you've seen the last of me for a long, long time."
(ASHLEY CHUCKLES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
"Others will come like ballerinas and I... lt's not that bad, honestly!"
Why would I say so?
It can be done!
"We'll take it in here, alter this..."
"Anyway, we must add another colour."
I don't know why I always want blue.
"We'll take it in here a bit, shorten it there, you can make it a bit wider here."
I'll buy something for you here.
I probably won't go anywhere.
"I was looking forward to it, but I'm worked up about it."
I don't know why you're so sceptical and you keep doubting.
"It's not so bad, it can be put right."
Then I'll buy you a lovely dress.
I don't know what you want to alter.
I'll go in this...
"This is pretty, it's ... pique."
But it will look awful on me.
"A pleat here, blue there, elsewhere taken in, let out... I shall look ... awful."
It'll be just as I dreaded.
"Not only will I sit out, but what will I look like?"
I'm sorry.
But it's not as bad as you make out.
You always talk like that.
We're not so badly off that I can't even buy you... lt'll be better now.
It's terrible.
Pretty well the whole day.
"Once we played a bit in the morning, a bit in the afternoon..."
"Wait, we'll share it out."
"Well, okay."
"- You're wonderful, I'm waiting."
- All right.
- Where is it?
Go.
"Well, Juliet..."
I will lie with you tonight.
"As to the means, I will not wonder long."
I do remember an apothecary who lives not far from here... if it is life... where there is neither gold... nor food... nor rest.
"Hey, there!"
Apothecary!
Who calls so loud?
Come over here.
I see that you're poor.
There is no crime in that.
"Nor pleasure, neither."
"Now, listen, I seek a kind of poison so powerful that swallowed in one dram, it stops a man and drops him in his tracks before he may but mark the consequence."
"If this be murder, the answer's no."
The victim's one I have right to kill.
I have such mortal drugs.
But Mantua's law brings death to any man who issues them.
"Are you so thin and full of wretchedness, yet scared to die?"
Famine is in your cheeks.
The world is not your friend.
"You will not find that cherishing the law makes you rich, be not poor, and break the law for this."
"My poverty, not my will, consents."
I pay your poverty and not your will.
I'm looking for Lord Romeo.
He is gone.
Gone?
And in great haste.
Back to Verona.
What purpose had you with him?
Nothing now.
You've had a wasted journey.
Who can say?
"Okay, we're all gonna get through this, okay, mom?"
"And i gotta go, all right?"
"Mama, what's wrong?"
You don't look good.
"Marcus, what really happened between you and regina?"
- Oh.
"- I know you let her go to make a point,"
But couldn't you have held onto her
And made your point in another way?
"Your family has fallen apart, son."
I did what i thought was best at the time.
Regina knows how i feel about her.
But our marriage wasn't important enough
For her to make the compromises she had to for the family.
It was all about her career and not about us.
"She wanted more, so i let her go and find it."
How long and how hard can you hold onto someone
Who is selfish and wants to be free?
"She's a grown woman, mom."
I can't hold onto her against her will.
"I understand, marcus."
"But whatever you do, don't let her divorce you."
Try and hold onto her for all of our sakes.
The ball is in her court and she knows it.
She's always known that i'd take her back.
She just has to say the word and i'll act as if none of this ever happened.
"I hate seeing her this way, but i can't make her want me"
Or want a life with me.
"I love her with all my heart,"
But i can't stand in her way if she wants to be free.
Okay?
"But really, i gotta go, mom."
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say, bro-in-law!"
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, you big crazy!"
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers, but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see, and I see her brighter and more clearly than anything else in this world."
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
I'd like to start the service with a passage from Ted's dream journal.
"""Drowning."
"""Gasping for air."
"No escape."""
"Wait, is that about Vietnam?"
It's about Whole Foods.
Barney.
We are not getting married.
And those aisles are too narrow!
"But you two have to get married-- otherwise, it's just a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand."
"Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?"
Yes.
Barney... don't you see?
Your detox is done!
You're over one-night stands!
"And if it happens, I will say that it has been by love to ltalia."
"You stop, Moroni."
"By the way, one does not take advantage during the visits to touch to me..."
It does not say that.
"Itself I sound with you, with caressing the Alps to him..."
"With seeing that wonderful Sicily, Calabria and Campania..."
With putting my head on those rich and prosperous Romans.
"And then, by the breach of Pia Porthole, to penetrate triumphally in Rome."
"Bravo, Moroni, honour degree in Geography."
What has been believed?
The university is not a gymnasium for its erotic exercises.
Shame on you!
"And you learn to respect the nurses, those celestial beings who sacrifice all their life by the patients."
They do not have to be used like vulgar prostitutes.!
Get out!
"-pardons, Professor..."
-Outside!
-Italia.
Italy.
Land of poets...
-Professor.
"-Of saints, navigators."
-What does?
Now?
-You already know that here you excites more to me.
-If we are in the operating room.
"Indeed, wanted."
"As I announced to you, today you will see the recording of a apencicectomía realised by Prof. Ciotti the past times."
I will be in charge personally of comentároslaa measured that...
Moroni!
"Good morning, Professor."
"Please, you continue."
But your servant said you were meeting with the king.
So?
It was very late.
"If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake."
I know the chÃ¢teau you claim to stay at in angers
Where you ran into francis.
It burned down last year.
I don't know what happened
"Between the two of you, but I can guess,"
So please don't counsel me on mistakes.
"Come along, girls, be of service to your queen."
Girl:
"oh, my sweetest child god's smile behind your eyes in his hand, in our arms you will find no harm."
Who are you?
Why are you singing that song?
I was told to sing it near you.
By who?
I was paid by another who was paid by a girl...
I don't know who.
She's dead.
That girl is dead.
It's impossible.
The messenger who delivered the news
Of the english queen's death isn't here.
I suppose he knew he'd served his purpose
"And that your invitation was a mere courtesy,"
A thanks for giving us both what we want.
You bribed him to bear false news.
"To get the job done,"
As you failed in that task completely.
You can thank me later.
"the power of love a force from above cleaning my soul flame on, burn desire love with tongues of fire purge the soul make love your goal"
What did you find out about Kim Yang?
"Lord Dangje, the regent's father, is looking after the new governor."
Is there a reason why?
"Kim Yang is a very competent man, who has risen in the ranks very rapidly."
He was revered by the people under his rule.
Some have even built a monument in his honor.
He seems to be an extraordinary man.
It would be wise to make an ally of him.
"Captain, it is I, Tae-bong."
Come in.
What is it?
The new governor is headed for Chunghae.
Why is he going to Chunghae?
I haven't found that out yet.
The scout ship is ready to set sail.
Search the waters near Yongeum Island.
You will be able to find Yum Moon's hideout.
He could attack any minute.
Be very careful during your mission.
"Yes, sir."
Set sail!
What division do the troops belong to?
"That's the flag of the Sajageum division, the Mujinju governor's guards."
My lord.
What brings you out in this cold weather?
The new governor is here to pay his respects to you.
What brings you to Chunghae?
I have been appointed governor of Mujinju by your grace.
I came to pay my respects.
You came all this way just to pay your respects?
"If you have the time, you should use it to carry out your duty."
You didn't seem very friendly to the governor.
-No.
He didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
"I mean, what if a person came to you, you know, that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
Would you have to turn them in?
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
"And, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
"First, I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 1 6th century."
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
"Oh, yes?"
Since when?
"Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"To begin with, it could make things worse."
"Kaman, you gotta let me go."
"Please, let me go."
What do you want?
I'll give you anything you want.
You want money?
You want a job?
"Just don't do anything stupid, man, all right?"
Damn it!
"Come on, man!"
"[Garcia] Okay, from the look of Kaman Scott's early years, he was on a fast track to be some kind of hoodlum, bad boy, super convict, but something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune"
"'cause then there's no arrests, there's no suspicions."
"There's no sign of rehab, but he totally cleaned up."
Maybe that's when he met someone.
Has he ever been arrested with a man named Tommy Proctor?
"Yeah, once."
"Uh, 2002."
Yikes.
And then they collided again in 2005.
"Like, literally collided."
"Kaman was in an accident, and his car blew up."
"Well, there's your gas accelerant."
"[Garcia] He was hit by that guy, Tommy Proctor."
And there's your revenge.
Twist of fate.
The life he left behind came back to haunt him.
"So Tommy walks away without a scratch, and Kaman suffers a ton of third-degree burns, had a boatload of skin grafts, was in a coma for a couple of months, lost his apartment..."
"Oh, and then there's that guy."
His landlord was Tony Torrell.
So we were right.
He does have a revenge list.
"What about family, friends, acquaintances?"
"No, that Kaman is a lone wolf."
Is our solar ray still functional?
"In fact, it's operating at an efficiency rate of 12,000%."
Transfer all available power to the time drive.
"Get ready to eject the meteor, and pray that we have enough power for one last jump."
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Our time will remain intact.
"The world, not so much."
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We'd never get it
- far enough away.
- Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
where's Rip?
And the meteorite?
Will somebody please tell me what just happened?
Rip?
Sorry if I gave you all a fright.
What happened to the meteor?
"Uh, I flew it into the heart of the sun."
"Well, I angled the ship to eject the meteorite before impact, and then, uh... time jumped away."
- You could have been killed.
- Should have been.
You're a moron.
"Now, who fancies a return trip to 2016?"
- I can't believe it's over.
"- Well, for some of you, yes."
"My journey, it seems, is only just beginning."
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.
"The Time Masters are no longer of growing concern, due to our destruction of the Oculus."
Someone needs to be responsible for protecting the timeline.
What happened to you?
"I did try, Clark."
"In fact, when we first met, you inspired me."
"All I wanted was to be your friend, but... you turned your back on me."
So you're the person you are today because of me.
I tried to be your friend.
But all you care about is power and control.
This is Smallville!
"Meteor freaks, alien ships, cryptic symbols!"
These threats are real.
Someone had to take control.
Someone has to protect the world.
Listen to yourself.
"You're so caught up in your own delusions, you've lost track of reality."
Have I?
Then let's talk about something you can't deny.
"After years of pleading with my father to show me some compassion, he turned to you, with open arms."
"What would a worldly billionaire have in common, with a simple farm boy?"
Maybe he just knew he could trust me.
Of course.
Everyone can trust Clark Kent.
You're the perfect son.
So why did Jonathan Kent always seem so stressed?
Was raising the perfect son really that much work?
I wonder how much of a strain it put on his heart.
Are you blaming me for my father's death?
Are you?
!
"You're the guilty one, not me."
"And this time, you're gonna own up to what you've done."
I know you killed Lionel.
- Who's delusional now?
Are they affiliated with anybody up here?
They seem to have good relations with a Latino street gang that moved up here from L.A. about 3 years ago.
"That gang was originally from Guatemala, very tight, impossible to penetrate."
Half of them were in the army.
"These are the guys who are gonna take Reardon's place, much nastier."
Let's talk about what might happen if Reardon left the dope scene.
- You predict chaos.
- Mayhem.
You can already smell it.
"Now with the Americans in the picture, it could get even uglier."
They bring a lot of guns along.
It gets exponentially crazier.
We should be proactive on this and pursue your idea of trying to encourage an alliance.
That might avoid all that.
Can you speak to Dante about that?
See if you can plant that in his ear?
Thanks for listening to me.
"How are you, honey?"
You want some more juice?
- What are you doing today?
- I'm gonna take Sweet shopping and look for a crib.
"I thought after, I'd take them to see the house we're looking at."
That's a good idea.
"Let me know what you think, besides the fact they're asking ten-times too much."
Have fun.
Did Ronnie tell you two we wanted you
- to be godparents?
- I'd be so proud.
Thank you.
Really?
Thank you.
What an honour.
Your money?
"My five thousand, that you owe me."
You probably mean this here.
You glue money to the wall?
Is that five thousand?
Yes.
You owe me money and glue it to the wall?
Are you insane?
"Toni, look at it like this."
"My office is your place of pilgrimage,"
You can always come here and beg forgiveness for your greed.
Stop this bullshit!
Euro-Basilica!
"From now on, we'll call it Euro-Basilica!"
I'll have you sent to the insane asylum.
You along with your loony sister and the other idiots too.
Should I explain how I really see it?
"So my dear Franz, I'll give you untill the end of the week to get these bills off the wall."
"Otherwise I'll call the police, and I'll call the press."
"That way the whole world can see the idiots, with whom I have to co-exist."
I also have to co-exist with you... with your America fetish and the stench of your bar... and the constantly changing waitresses bitching to us that you won't pay them.
"Actually, I should bash your face in for all this."
But my father and your father are brothers.
"Well, I'll come up with a plan."
Think up something.
"And you darling, come up with a plan as well."
I already have.
Try getting them off with steam.
Max the Hunter
Max the Hunter
- Excuse me.
What?
You are now looking at the new colonel of the ninth regiment.
"And this time, the uniform is going to be the genuine article."
"Where'd you get it, jim?"
Are they selling commissions now?
"No, of course not."
I just paid the regiment's deficit and told the militia boys i'd get them a job on the railroad.
"Work is the crying need of today, luke."
"And besides, they're a nice, tough bunch of boys to have around in case of trouble."
Now you go out and get them a job on the erie.
The whole regiment?
Yeah.
"Go ahead, go ahead."
"You know, i feel just like an actor having my uniform made in theater."
What's the matter with this waistline?
"It sticks out a bit, don't it?"
"Only sticks out where you stick out, boss."
"Say, what goes with these suits?"
A bass drum or a bugle?
"Say, i want a shiny sword, too."
"But you only carry a sword while on parade, mr."
Fisk.
It doesn't make any difference.
"Even if it don't cut cheese, i'm not gonna fight with it, anyway."
One shiny sword.
"- Yes, sir."
And put a big hunk of gold on the handle.
"Yes, sir."
"You know, i always did like a uniform."
"Me, too."
You could make me a dozen uniforms like this.
"Here's josephine, napoleon."
"Well, do i pass inspection?"
I want a complete record of this.
Mr. Spock.
What do we have on this general area?
"Virtually nothing, captain."
No records of any explorations.
There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.
"However, none has ever been recorded."
Anything on intelligent life forms?
"Nothing specific, captain."
Unscientific rumours only.
More like space legends.
"Security control, this is bridge."
Status report.
"Mr. Sulu, status, alien vessel."
"They must be aware we're after them, sir."
They've gone to warp 6 also.
Warp factor 7.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Something the matter, Mr. Spock?"
"A sustained warp-7 speed will be dangerous, captain."
"Thank you, Mr. Spock."
I mean to catch them.
"We'll either catch them, or we'll blow up, captain."
They may be faster than we are.
They'll have to prove it.
"Yes, Mr. Spock?"
"You mean to destroy the alien ship, captain?"
Of course.
I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
Destruction may be unnecessary.
"Colony Cestus III has been obliterated, Mr. Spock."
"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim."
This is awkward.
"Bad career move, in fact."
"Hey, forget it."
What?
I don't need the new shift commander PO'd at me.
It's a woman to woman thing.
- Is this about Beau?
- Yeah.
How does that go?
"Sleep with a cop, sleep with his partner."
I'm the only one who knows.
I'm the only one he told and I made him tell.
And you don't approve?
See it from my end.
"I'm still on the street, closing my cases 100%... because Beau and I are in tune, in sync."
I got Beau covering my back.
"You two can't be a secret forever, it will come out."
"There'll be jokes, snide remarks, bitching about favouritism, and one of you'll be transferred."
"And it's not gonna be the new female shift commander, so that'll leave me solo, with no one except maybe his wife and I to cry on each others shoulders."
What's she like?
"Caucasian, 5"" 6', 105Ibs, no distinguishing marks."
"Nothing distinguishing at all, except a husband who made it out of South Baltimore to become a homicide detective."
It's a world she doesn't understand and can't compete with.
I'm not competing.
That's what winners always say.
She wants him back?
"With all the upstanding, eligible bachelors craving a mother with three small children, what's she need Beau for?"
Frank?
- We may have a witness.
- Witness?
"Yes, she said she saw who killed Marilyn Callisto."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Everyone seems to be leaving me.
Home was my haven.
Now everything there just reminds me of everything not there.
Chuck.
"I mean, Charlotte."
Her room is how she left it.
"Clothes in the closet, her books on the shelves."
"Her special pillow, still at the head of the bed."
I didn't know she had a special pillow.
It was her father's.
"I'm sure it's teeming with fungus and microscopic bugs that feed on flakes of human skin, but she was fond of it."
"I know you loved having Charlotte safe at home smiling on the other side of the room, but she's gone."
She's moved out.
Hm?
I mean on.
She's moved on.
Maybe it's time for you to move on and get rid of that pillow.
As the Pie-Maker considered Chuck's worldly belongings  and how Vivian clinged to them  Olive was clinging to her own.
"Uh, excuse me."
Mother Superior.
Hi.
I have been here for a day and was told the porter would come for my things.
- Do I need to tell him what room I'm in?
"- The poor, sister."
The poor will come for your belongings.
Part of your vow of poverty?
I thought that was a temporary vow since I'm only gonna be a temporary nun.
Don't you have some kind of storage facility?
This is your home for as long as you're here.
"And as long as you're here, you will live as a nun."
But I like my belongings.
That's why they belong to me.
"Michael, you might want to double-check your head count."
"Hey, Sam."
Everything all right?
"You know, Mike, uh..."
"The last time I kissed my lady, she was crying."
I left her to be interrogated by the CIA so we could escape.
I'm sorry.
We're getting the passports.
We need to know if you're coming.
"Yeah, well, I got to think about that, Mike."
I'll let you know.
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
I can't believe you're going to build a mosque.
I know.
It's surreal.
"So, what's your first step going to be?"
"You know, I got so caught up in the excitement,"
I didn't actually think how we're going to do it.
"OK, well, you're going to need a location and permit,"
- So why don't you talk to Ann?
"- Oh, that's a good idea."
"I will explain to her how the idea came about, hmm..."
"Through an unlikely friendship with a chicken,"
I was given a sign that told me I should build a mosque.
Maybe leave out the part about the chicken 'cause it's a little weird.
"You know, I'm going to go see Ann now and see if she's got a few minutes to spare."
So you're probably wondering why I'm here.
I'm wondering what's taking you so long to get to the point of why you're here.
- I want to build a mosque in Mercy.
- Uh-huh.
"Technically, I know we have a mosque in the church already, but you know that was supposed to be temporary anyway."
She would get very frustrated.
"Anne, you know, lives two blocks from my home."
I see.
And Harriet too would call.
"Yes, and Harriet would call."
"- And so, what would you do?"
"- I mean, he would be, like, MIA."
And sometimes I didn't know where he was or what he was doing.
"But he'd just say, ""I'm not in the office,"
"""so tell them such and such,"
"""or tell them you don't know where I am."
"So, you know, whatever."
"He would tell me what to do, and I just did it."
"So you... you remember, then, the day that Lou left for India the last time?"
"Oh, yes, yes."
You were here to see Lou off with your mother.
Yeah.
How did you know that?
"Well, I was in the office with you, because we couldn't push him out the door."
I came to the office because
I knew he wouldn't...
he'd miss his plane.
And he did the same thing.
He changed his clothes in the room where the Xerox machine was and came walking out all disheveled and left money... foreign currency from another country... all over the place.
And you and your mother literally had to push him into the taxicab.
"And once he got in the cab, then I could go home."
My own memory of that night is somewhat different.
He was working on the model for the Capital of Bangladesh.
We left him at the office at around 10:00.
He waved down to me from the top of the stairs.
The last thing I saw of him was his hand.
"""Dearest boy o' mine,"
I don't want such a husband.
Whose hands are bloodied.
I don't want such a love.
Whose basis is on someone else's shoulder.
This bloodied war had orphaned me when I was young.
"If it is in my destiny to part away from you,"
"Then, I accept that."
"""Holding on to the dreams, we shall walk ahead""."
"""If ever you are lost, I shall find you out""."
"""To be lost and found, and lost again""."
"""To laugh and cry, in love""."
"""Let the victory be of both of us and the loss be only mine""."
"""Let the victory belong to you and I loose""."
I could have crushed you under the vehicle.
- Not scared?
- Scared for what?
Scared of losing what?
Everything has been lost now.
You think I have won.
"But for the first time in life, I lost even after winning."
Sheen shall marry me.
Her body shall be with me.
But her heart will remain with you.
"Till now, I have got what I wanted, completely."
"Sheen became mine, but only half."
And I don't accept half victory.
Shadab!
"Even if you were to bury me... alive, yet the flowers on my grave would be of Sheen's name."
"""In this game of love, in this union of two hearts""."
"""Let the victory be of both of us and the loss be only mine""."
"""A palm of yours and the other be mine""."
"""A palm of yours and the other be mine""."
"What about if she comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's son Jasper?
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney,get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come after you?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebody needs to go to my mom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinner yet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up for you, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe it would be okay if I, uh, crashed here for the night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell me what's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and give you some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
Enough with the complicated stuff.
Just tell me whether or not you can save him... as a doctor.
You bastard!
What are you doing right now?
Answer me.
I can save him.
Then save him.

There's about to be a war!
I'm going to kill you all for mutiny!
His blood pressure is dropping too much too suddenly.
There's too much bleeding.
What are we going to do?
"If something bad happens to this patient, aren't we all going to die?"
"Dismiss Captain Yoo Si Jin of his duties for disobeying command, and... get ready to place him under detention."
"So then, why did you do something that useless?"
Useless?
!
"Because of me, one person's life--I haven't seen Captain Yoo around..."
Did he go somewhere?
"According to military code, he'll go to prison for disobeying command."
"How could you not know this, when you're the one who argued to proceed with the surgery that everyone was against doing?"
FERON:
She's mad.
She saw us together last night.
I'll talk to her.
Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night.
You okay?
You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over.
"He had just told me about this horrid job he's taken in New Zealand, so he's gonna be gone for like ever now."
"Well, did you tell him not to?"
"When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person."
"Yes, and I changed my mind."
I-I spoke to her over the phone.
About what?
About Kelly's disappearance.
I asked her if she would check Alan's cell phone and see if there were any recently made calls.
And?
She wouldn't do it.
"You don't take no for an answer, Sherry."
What aren't you telling me?
"Nothing, David, I swear."
What have you been up to since we last talked if you weren't at Milliken's?
Making calls.
You could have made them from here.
"Yes, but I didn't."
"I parked on the side of the road,"
I started making calls because I didn't want to wait.
I told you we have a small window of opportunity here.
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
I have other things to attend to.
Okay.
Is there anything else?
That's it.
This should be a good show.
"Yeah, it's just like Morgan, going out with style."
"S-s-so, Annie was a doll."
Glad you two had fun.
We had some interesting conversations.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Mm-hmm, about the business model."
"What we've been doing right, wrong, how to expand, where to get more pento."
I had a feeling you'd get her back onside.
I can be very convincing.
Mmm.
I love funerals.
Nothing like staring death in the face to make you feel alive.
"Watch the Series Premiere of The Blacklist Redemption, Thursday on Global."
Scottie Hargrave is in charge of a global intelligence gathering operation.
"You should know, I have anger issues."
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Take it easy.
You're hired.
You want me to work for you?
We could do incredible things together.
You really know how to push my buttons.
Welcome to the family.
"Your sister's response is a typical consequence of loss, numbness that follows a period of intense grief."
"Losing one's parents, especially so suddenly, can be deeply disorienting."
Rest is what she needs.
"At Rosewood, she will have the benefit of time and privacy to recuperate."
"I don't see why, if rest and recuperation is what you prescribe, we couldn't simply repair to the coast as usual."
"Or if warmer weather is what she needs, we could go to Italy."
This place is tiny!
And I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hangin' all over the bathroom.
"They're called boxers, Carla."
"They're satin, J.D.?"
With a breathable cotton crotch panel!
King me!
"Ugh, I need to find someone to split the rent at my place."
I thought you were getting good money at your new fellowship?
"So first, my fellowship gets canceled because some jackass cures the disease, and now the only job I can get is working at this crappy free clinic for eight bucks an hour."
No one's life could be worse than mine!
Uh...the...fellowship's great!
Heh!
"Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them"
I'm working at a free clinic!
I sense she doesn't want me to tell them.
Women have an unspoken connection men can't even fathom!
"Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here, but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secrets commercial."
I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!
You know... you--you two could solve both of your problems if you just moved in together.
- Whooooooa.
Hold your horses!
- Whoa!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, and whoa-ho!"
We have a very complicated past.
"Yeah, I hurt her, and I'm not proud."
I'm a little proud.
"We've managed to restore our friendship, though, by staying away from dangerous topics."
"Yeah, relationships, and things of that nature."
J.D. and I keep it superficial.
Love the superficial.
Dynamite teeth today!
"Oh, thanks, buddy!"
"Then Doug turned on him, and I wasn't gonna let that happen."
- I'm sure you made the right decision.
- He took him.
"He just picked him up early at school one day, and he disappeared."
Did you call the police?
Yeah.
Every day.
"But technically, we're still married, and he is Jasper's father... so without a custody order, they can't do anything."
"Oh, please."
I cannot wait for the courts to sort this out.
Do you have any idea where he might have taken him?
None.
"I have no idea, 'cause I've hardly spoken to him in months."
Do you have pictures?
Yeah.
That's Jasper.
Please.
Lucy said you could find him.
"I need to know that he's okay, and I want him back."
I'm gonna find him.
One of the things you learn in training... is to avoid situations that cut too close.
If you had a rough childhood... a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid is gonna make you angry.
"That can be motivating, but it can also be dangerous."
"Well, she's a looker."
What's the story?
- Husband ran off with her kid.
"- You all right, Mike?"
I'm gonna find this guy.
Facts are the hallmark of a good false identity.
It's harder to create history than it is to alter it.
"Plus, the more truth to your lie... the easier it is to remember."
"I don't see you for weeks,and you start going through the closets?"
"$2 million is the price, and they're worth 3."
I'll have to see my board of directors.
But i can't hold out much hope.
"I'm sorry, uncle daniel, but the deal fell through."
"They won't go a penny higher than $1,500,000."
It's downright sinful.
Let's draw up a contract.
"Oh, sit down right here, uncle daniel."
"Boys, i got it!"
"What, 500,000 for us?"
And out of the tightest pocketbook in new york.
And everybody is satisfied.
"Stonington gets their boats, drew makes a profit, and we're on the road to future glory!"
"What do we do to celebrate, jim?"
We're gonna have some fun.
Follow me.
I've been looking at that sign all day.
"""Mademoiselle fleurique and her dimpled darlings in playtime in paris."
"50 girls 50."""
"Say, i got to meet them 50 girls 50, and they got to meet me!"
I'll take fleurique.
You high-flyers can fight over the 50 girls 50.
"Hey, i got dibs on fleurique."
We better let her know we're coming.
Take all those flowers over to her.
"They worked with drew, maybe they'll be lucky with her."
"Oh, luke-stick a french flag in that flower boat."
"Ooh, la, la, la, la as we tour in gay paris 'cause it's gay and it's fun and it's done ooh, la, la"
"It's a naughty, naughty place but it's what we call chichi say it once, say it twice, and it's nice ooh, la, la"
"When you're walking in the dark in the so-romantic park and he steals a kiss or two just say ooh la, la, la, la, la, la it's naive and it's blase what it means i cannot say"
"but it's fun and it's done and it's gay ooh, la, la"
she's what i call a lalapalooza.
But it was over.
"That I explained everything to you, and you believed it."
Did Drew believe it?
"I think so, yes."
What if he told someone else?
I think we should wait until we're sure.
You need to finish mixing the explosive.
My brother says we could be activated at any time.
"If we get the code, we must be ready to go."
Are you there?
I got to go.
Carter this is crazy.
You'll never get out of there alive.
"Just tell me if the money is at the police station, Rebecca."
Your source is right.
"Metro pd made a drug bust in southeast d.C., recovered a little over $4.6 million in cash."
Can you tell me where the evidence lockers are?
"Yes, first floor, next to dispatch, but they're covered by two surveillance cameras."
"But I'll hack in and put them in a loop, create a blind spot."
You can do that?
Welcome to our world.
"Before you do anything, give us some time"
To see if we can find the leak.
How long is that going to take?
"20 minutes, 30 tops."
"No, no, it's too long, okay."
Grimes is expecting this money in half an hour.
Then we'll bring CTU into this.
Take our chances Mullins isn't the leak.
We can't take that chance rebe...
"Listen... everything that's happening, it's on me."
"Eric, that's not true."
"Billy, did you steal something from the hotel?"
"Yeah, well, I wish I could tell you more, but that's all I know."
"Well, you helped a lot."
At least now I know when that outfit was in Gold mine Canyon.
"Yeah, that's good."
"Sheriff, I saw that RV today."
I know you did.
"Listen, I told him all about it already."
"No, you didn't."
"Sheriff,"
I stole something from that RV.
"And now I want to turn myself in, even if it means 99 years."
"Well, why don't you just give me back what you stole and maybe we can skip the 99 years."
"On the other hand, stealing is a pretty serious matter."
maybe you and me ought to have a little private talk about it.
"Sheriff, it's you and I, not you and me."
"Well, whatever."
"Listen, I want you to tell me everything you know about this medallion."
There was this man at the hotel.
He's a waiter.
He was wearing one just like it.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
"And by the van, there was this long old car with bullets in the front."
It was following us [stutters] and then I saw it there.
"Well, now that is something."
Will I be called as a witness in the trial?
"Well, it's a possibility."
"But right now, I want you to do me a favor, okay?"
I want you and your folks to go right on down there and have a real good time at that frontier town.
Will you do that?
How did you know we were going there?
"It's hardly the style for you, dear."
I asked the chauffeur to bring the car around.
I do have a cab waiting.
Howard can take care of that.
I would prefer it if Corbett drove you.
As you like.
"- Merle, we'll be late if--"
"- Goodbye, Aunt Olivia,"
- Uncle Howard--
- Enjoy yourselves.
"But be back by 5:00, remember?"
"You need your rest, Merle."
We'll remember.
"Come on, Merle, let's go."
Bye-bye.
"She's quite beautiful, isn't she, Howard?"
Miss Gilbert?
"Yes, I suppose she is."
"Still, on the whole, I think you'd prefer Margo Stevens-- [chuckle]-- if you had your pick, that is."
Must we go through this every time--
"Oh, don't flatter yourself that I'm jealous, Howard, of Margo or any of the other silly young creatures that you mentally pursue."
It's the effect of your behavior on Merle that I'm thinking of.
"Oh, good heavens."
Merle will be 21 next week.
"And as her trusted trustee, can you honestly say that Merle is mature enough to even pick out her own movies, let alone watch her uncle make a fool of himself?"
"Oh, Olivia, for heaven's--"
"Howard, I think you'd better pay off that cab driver, hadn't you?"
I wish Aunt Olivia would let me buy dresses like that.
I wish I could afford dresses like that.
"Good afternoon, ladies."
"If I'm in time for lunch, I think I'll have a watercress sandwich and a little bowl of fruit."
"Oh, aren't we funny."
"Promise you won't mention it again, or even think about it!"
- Promise me!
- Why?
"If you say that to anyone else, you'll be in big trouble, and I won't be there to help you."
"If it'll make you happier, I promise."
- However much we like her...
- Do you like her too?
"Of course, how couldn't I?"
She likes you too.
"Benigno, Alicia is practically dead!"
"She can't feel anything for anybody, not for you, not for me, not even for herself!"
Get that into your head!
Our patient Alicia Roncero has been raped and is pregnant.
I haven't told her father yet because first you're going to tell me what bastard did that in my clinic.
"Sir, we all feel extremely concerned."
You should be feeling responsible.
Alicia was on your floor.
Then let me be the one to explain the situation.
"Rosa, please..."
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
"He's a racist and a little shady, maybe, but a murderer?"
"It may be just a feeling, but I know he's in this."
We just need to figure out how.
Iayudame!
Iayudame!
Shot execution style just like all the others.
Why put him in there?
There must be something symbolically important.
There's something inconsistent about the staging.
"It's not remorse, and it's not a forensic countermeasure either."
Each of these families were registered gun owners.
That must be how he's selecting his victims.
He wants them to fight back.
It's propaganda for his race war.
He's turning the families into martyrs.
And the fall guy takes the blame.
"But now he's lost control because his fall guy got away, and he's devolving."
His name's Ramon Gomez.
He's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico City.
And he's pretty freaked out.
"Well, that's understandable."
Was he able to give a description of the unsub?
Just of the vehicle.
His English is not good.
We put an APB out.
Hola.
Mi nombre es Emily Prentiss.
Preston campaign headquarters.
This is...
And please tell everybody that I appreciate all of their help.
"Sometimes I don't have a chance to do it personally, so it's really great what they do."
"Hey, uh, Clark, you got a second?"
People from the production crew are really harsh too.
"Even if she is a temporary worker, it shouldn't be like, ""We're about to take a chance to have you fired."""
Look at just what they are doing!
How come those people are so cruel?
"No matter how weak or fragile, you can't just treat a person recklessly."
I will be talking until here.
I'm sorry for blabbering.
Call the director.
"If it's not PD No Eul, I won't shoot a cut be it a documentary or what."
If they don't want the representative actor of the agency then they should put back PD No Eul to her usual place.
"Ahjussi, eat one."
"Okay, I'll stop."
Proposal cancelled.
You should just tell me that you don't want me to be your wife.
Why are you drinking strong soju when you can't even handle alcohol well.
Hey... 'it's not like that No Eul.'
'Why would I reject such a lovely like No Eul?
'
'I just like it so much that I don't know what to do right now.'
You're not saying those.
You still won't say it.
I don't really like it as well!
♬  Just one last night here  ♬
♬  Remembering what we gave up  ♬
♬  This golden love  ♬
"♬  Oh, we were destined  ♬"
He won't even come after me.
He is not that great at all.
Why is he stubborn?
"Ah, this is so embarrassing!"
"Rejected from my job, and rejected from my proposal, nothing went well."
That's because I am the third party!
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.
"I mean, he's treating me like I'm a fuckin' half-a- fag or something."
I'm gonna wind up a lammist. I gotta go on the fuckin' lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
"If you tell him, he'll stop."
I'll wind up being declared M.l.A.
"They're gonna find me in the back of a car somewhere, in the weeds?"
You've known this fuckin' Tommy all your life.
Who knows better than you?
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
"When I leave my house in the morning, before I get to the car, I'm lookin' over both shoulders."
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.
"-Tell me what I gotta do, whatever the fuck I gotta do I'm gonna do, no?"
-What could I do?
"If there was something I could do, don't you think I would do it?"
"You know me, I'd like to help you out."
Sonny...tell him what we talked about.
"Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this fuckin' joint. it'd be good."
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this fuckin' joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
"I don't mean any disrespect, but that's the way it is."
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
But he's capable of driving a getaway car.
It's funny.
A lot of stuff gets stolen from howard stark...
"Cars, bombs, death rays."
"Actually, the death ray's accounted for."
"It's in nevada, I believe."
Hmm.
You know these men?
Take a good look.
We have reliable information that says
That both of these men were in possession
"Of some of your boss' misdoings,"
And now they're dead.
"Oh, what a pity."
Sounds like you found our thieves.
"Unless, of course, they were working for your boss."
Would you look at that?
"Five minutes in,"
And thompson hasn't knocked out a single tooth.
"Well, don't let this guy fool you."
He may be a butler...
butlers know powerful people.
"If we don't play this just right,"
He'll have a dozen lawyers down here by lunch.
What about the stolen-car report?
Currently lost in the system.
"But if the car was actually stolen,"
We got nothing to use on him.
"Eh, we got something that'll rattle this limey's cage good."
"I'll tell you, you know what I would do"
If the bumper fell off my car while I was committing a crime?
I'd file a stolen-car report.
- For what?
For snatching bodies and selling the pieces.
"Look, I didn't steal anything."
I work in the mortuary as st.
Mark's medical center.
I oversee the anatomical procurement services.
"Yeah, they confirmed that."
Okay.
So we provide specimens to schools and researchers.
It's illegal to profit from the sale of body parts.
"Look, we only charge for their transportation, storage, and processing."
"It is a vital, legal service."
And it's all above board.
"As long as the bodies are donated, not paid for."
Who donated the body in the back of your van?
"I don't know, but I can get you the paperwork."
You have any paperwork on Manette Combs?
/ Who?
Manette wasn't an organ donor.
She never willed her body to science.
And you bought her corpse from Mark Mogan at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office.
"Chopped her up, sold her parts."
And then dumped what you couldn't sell.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not what you told me before.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call."
"What, you set me up?"
Her face ring a bell?
"We found her head, her arm, and a leg."
Where's the rest of her?
Ask my lawyer.
Then you cook on her.
You ass.
From how long is this going on?
- Why are you hitting her unjustly?
Why are you feeling when I am hitting her?
Why are you talking so with such a great man?
What ?
He is shown concern on you at the hospital and now you are showing on him.
Are you both planning to show me a movie now?
"Hubby, it is ₹ 5 lakhs."
You liked it and bought it at Germany.
I do not care..
"Tukaram sir, you are unnecessarily imagining whatever."
He is a public figure.
But my wife is a private figure.
- You are misunderstanding.
"I am telling as a wife, he is a very great man."
And has also got Padmasri in recognition to that.
Opposition people used this photo to showcase him bad.
"Though your husband looks cunning, you look very genuine."
What do you want me to do?
You should have a press meet and say publicly.
"You want me to make all public, that happened in private till now?"
"Not that he has a relation, but you should say there is no relation."
"Still, what are these issues on our marriage day?"
Your marriage day?
- It is so in the script.
Script?
- In the script written by Lord Brahma.
I will think tonight in my drink whether to come tomorrow or not.
"Karthik, he is over acting a lot."
"- True, sir!"
- I'd rather not.
It's late for Buddy and I ought to finish these socks.
"Come on, Frank, you and Ruth can chaperon us."
Lay off.
I told you I don't wanna go.
What are you gonna do?
Stay and make faces at yourself all night?
Will you go on to the movies and let me alone?
Come on.
No job's worth eating your heart out.
"But it was my job, wasn't it?"
You said so.
"I said so, but the company didn't."
They got their own ideas.
Where did they get the idea Dombrowski was so hot?
"Well, he invented that oiling system that they're using now."
He's saving them dough.
They figure that a guy who could do that could save them in other ways.
He's got his nose in a book and going to school while we lay around and listen to radio.
You gotta hand it to him.
"They've already handed it to him, ain't they?"
I suppose if I went around showing off reading books they'd make me president of the company.
"If you wanna be a sorehead, forget it."
Sorehead?
Sure I'm a sorehead.
Ain't I got a right to be?
How would you like it if you'd been counting on a break sure you was gonna get it and all you got was laughed at just because some guy's been sucking around the boss?
- Yeah?
"- Hello, Mr. Taylor."
This is Jenkins of the Zenith Auto Sales Company.
I showed you the car this afternoon.
"Well, forget it."
My savior.
"I send you out to find more evidence against Reinhardt, and this is what you bring back?"
We supposed to apologize?
"Dental resin or no, Reinhardt is still the most viable suspect."
And that bite is the most damning piece of evidence.
I don't know what to do with this.
And I don't want it falling in the wrong hands.
"I'll put it in my bottom drawer, counselor."
"You want it, you let me know."
I don't relish the day.
Fake teeth.
Isn't that a little theatrical?
Gillian Booth is theatrical.
A mother killing her grown daughter is hard to take.
I agree.
But the evidence is pointing that way.
Laura was trying to get the love of her mother's life fired.
Philip's next job was gonna be out of state.
Gillian might have freaked out that he'd be gone for good.
"Ah, sure."
Angry enough at her daughter to lose control?
"Yeah, if her adrenaline was pumping in anger."
Anger or panic.
Panic?
/ She's not someone who handles surprises well.
Take these subway maps we found in her dressing room.
She marked her route from the opera to her apartment with a highlighter.
And she used a different color to mark the route to her daughter's house.
And she did the same thing on every single map.
She's afraid of getting lost.
Marking all these maps?
That's not afraid.
"Well, there are worse things."
Don't make this your whole life.
Trust me.
It's not worth it.
Go home.
Get some rest.
Now.
And that is an order.
"Yes, sir."
"Now, not too many people realise this but the White House is actually three buildings:"
"The East Wing where you guys came in the West Wing, which houses the Oval and Executive Offices and we're about to enter the residence, which is the famous building that..."
-...got blown up in Independence Day.
- What's in there?
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.
"Right this way through the double doors, please."
There's still lots more to see.
You got a visitor.
Hey.
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
The White House is big.
"Including below-ground levels, it's six storeys tall with 132 rooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces and 35 bathrooms."
"The grounds contain a tennis court, a basketball court a putting green, a jogging track and a swimming pool."
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?
"She's referring to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre which is this really cool bunker behind 10 feet of concrete and steel that's capable of surviving a nuclear blast, plus for your information, miss, it's the one room in the house that no one knows the location of."
WikiLeaks says it's under the East Wing.
"Who wants to see the bowling alley, huh?"
"- Oh, my God."
"- How we doing, folks?"
He's going!
Take them away.
"Sister Renata, we have forced your foes to forsake the bodies of your sisters."
But we have discovered you are in a sinful pact with the devil.
"Confess your sin, apostate!"
I am not guilty of the sin which you have named.
Woe is us!
Get away from us!
"Sisters, come to your senses!"
Holy Sister Renata!
Holy Sister Renata!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
"- Back, insidious spirit!"
"You are the pure, innocent bride of a celestial angel."
"Pray for us, save us, deliver us from the Devil."
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
From this sister came all misfortunes.
From this sister came all devilish intrigues.
"Malign spirits, condemned and prohibited, banished, exiled,"
"I command and charge you, in the blinking of an eye, depart all of you who purvey iniquity..."
"You are holy and without sin, you save us sinners."
Sisters!
Sister Renata!
- Get away from me!

"Have pity, base one!"

Have pity!

You think we're being bugged?
[Beeping stops]
"We aren't sure exactly what or who we're looking for out here, so I figured, we can't be sure who's looking for us."
"So, what tripped the alarm?"
Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.
"[Beeps, whirring]"
"[Beeping] Ah, ha ha ha."
I'll be damned.
Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.
Mm.
[Sighs]
Hello.
Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter to the watch's battery.
"You think it's CIA, left over from my Thailand mission?"
Possible.
Doubt we'll ever know for sure.
Can't we track down where it was purchased?
No.
"I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible."
"But we have to try, right?"
"I mean, it's why we're here."
[Knock on door]
Kendall.
Wow.
You certainly have baited the hook.
"I had to, especially considering it's gonna be two against one tonight."
What are you talking about?
"Come on, Rick."
I know you're gonna sneak into Austin's house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him.
"I'm no fool, but you are if you think your little plan will work without these."
Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.
Where'd you get those?
"Hey, hey, look at this."
You won a prize.
Yeah.
What is that?
Homework.
They're assigning Cosmopolitan as homework?
"No, they assigned this, but I'm getting nowhere with it."
You can't relate that to the real world.
Like how?
"Like, was Mom a virgin when you married her?"
"What are you studying, religion?"
Sex.
Are you going to tell me about Mom or not?
No.
"Boy, that's good coffee."
Fresh brewed?
Instant.
"Now, how 'bout if you love someone?"
Do you have to have sex with them?
This can't be instant.
We ran out of beans.
"And if you kiss a girl, what base is that, and where's the birth canal?"
I have a chart.
"You never have to have sex if you don't want to, kissing a girl's first base, the birth canal's right there, and you shouldn't have sex unless you're in love and probably married."
Why not?
I don't remember-- it has something to do with not wanting to have babies with people you don't know.
It says in this magazine that there's a spot on a woman you can touch to drive her completely insane.
I don't think the magazine's a good idea.
"And in my experience, there is no such place."
Dad.
What?
"When I grow up, do I have to have hair all over my body?"
"-Yes, I do know."
"-First, you talk about a beating... and then we find out all you're discussing is a single blow."
Would you say that the arguments in the Lucas Cross house... were more or less violent than any other family arguments?
-Objection!
-What's the purpose of that question?
The witness must define her terms if the jury and this court... are to clearly understand what she means.
"A beating becomes one blow, a blow becomes a slap?"
Perhaps the slap will become something else.
Objection overruled.
-I have no further questions.
"-No questions, your Honor."
You may step down.
The prosecution would like to call Mrs. Constance MacKenzie.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Constance MacKenzie.
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've known the defendant a long time."
"Yes, since she was a baby."
Did Selena ever complained that her stepfather had beaten her... at any time?
-What?
-Did Selena ever complained...
"Oh, no."
No.
"Did you ever see any marks on her, injuries?"
No.
"You knew the defendant 's mother well, did you not?"
Nellie worked for me as a house maid.
Did she ever mentioned Lucas' brutality or... described any beating he had ministered?
"No, she said he was drunk and and lazy, and he deserted her..."
- Good day.
- Good day.
How can I help you?
I'm collecting for the local children's hospital.
"Would you care to make a donation, however modest?"
"Well, cabinet makers don't make much, but I think I could contribute a little something."
- (coins clinking)
- Every penny counts.
- Do you have children?
"- No, I don't."
It's a shame.
"There was a time when I thought I'd pass my skills on to a son, or a daughter for that matter."
But it wasn't to be.
"50 cents,"
- would that be enough?
- Absolutely.
"You know, you might have more luck in another part of town."
People around here are barely putting food on the table.
"It's not they don't have good hearts, you understand?"
I just don't want my neighbours feeling badly for having to say no to you.
"Of course, it's very thoughtful."
- Thank you for your time.
- Have a good day.

"I started when the poor boy's body was found, and I'm working backwards from there."
I'm down to 1890.
"It's very illuminating, sir, once you drop into the minutiae of it."
Here's a story about a sow that gave birth to 13 piglets.
Now that's a North Kawartha township record.
Very interesting.
"Sir, come look at this."
A farmer reports two British Home Children ran away from his employ:
Now that might be another way to go.
She knows the maestro's innocent because she knows who killed Laura.
Doesn't explain the bite mark.
I still think the teeth looked a little big.
Know what I mean?
The teeth marks could look larger because of the swelling of the wound.
I didn't say it was the only explanation.
"Well, what's option B?"
"According to Laura's dentist, she started a teeth whitening program four months ago."
He took a mold of her teeth... to make her a dental tray for the bleach.
"Listen, Rodgers... what if someone made a mold using Laura's dental tray?"
It would be an exact match of her bite.
Except the teeth would come out a little bigger.
"Thank you, Rodgers."
"DRESSING ROOM OF GILLIAN BOOTH OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28"
What is it with showbiz people and freebies?
She's got a subway map for every day of the year.
"Well, some people can never be too prepared."
"Detectives, in here."
"No dental tray or mold, but..."
dental resin.
That's what makeup people use to make fake teeth.
"25 years onstage, Gillian's got a few tricks up her sleeve, huh?"
She wore prosthetic teeth to leave a bite on Philip to match Laura.
She set him up.
That's how she's getting him to the altar.
"And by the power vested in me by the state of New York,"
I pronounce you husband and wife.
"Mr. Reinhardt, you may kiss your bride."
"You'll never regret this, Philip."
I promise.
My Siegfried.
Get up!
Can you handle this?
Henry.
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
I love how protective you are of me.
- You owe me an apology.
- For?
Doubting me.
- I did have certain apprehensions.
- Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
Is everybody dead?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
"We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
You... little... pussy.
That's what my old man called me.
It's like it was my name.
And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.
"I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide... are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?"
The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
"- No, that offer has expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
"Just tell me what you need, all right?"
I'm easy.
I'm gonna keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA.
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead."
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the attorney."
You go grab a fly swatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?"
"- We're not killing Badger, yo!"
"- Then you got real problems, okay."
Because the DEA will come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but, hey, he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognise your cough.
"Take that mask off, you know."
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a sh guy.
His clothes were dockers from sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large,the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear,gibbs."
"You're fishin',abs."
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer,have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes,doctor."
"Well,let's plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
"Agent gibbs will be here soon and he will ask... how'd the lance corporal die,doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try,""when did he die?"
""" That's my next question."
"That,I can answer."
It's a tricky calcution.
"One has to factor in temperature,soil acidity, and the variety and volume of insects who now call lance corporal finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days,with a three-rcent margin of error."
"It would appear you deserted before you die gibbs,lance corporal finn's fianc?"
's upstairs.
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"W,doctor?"
"As soon as I know,you'll know."
"Her name is siri albert.She's 25, lives in manassas,and works a physical therapist."
Finn's fianc?
I have Pyrellic poisoning.
Sleer's doing.
There is an antidote that prevents the poison's spreading.
"As long as I take it daily I get no worse, but Sleer, of course, controls my supply."
- So long as you manufacture Pylene-50.
- That is the threat always over my head.
To work for Sleer or to die in agony.
"But, from time to time,"
"Commissioner Sleer comes in here to taunt me, to gloat."
"Now, thanks to my outdated nitroglycerine, Dayna,"
I am ready.
I hope Leitz comes as well.
He usually does.
- Leitz.
- Almost as vile a sadist as Sleer.
"Yes, I should like Leitz to be here."
Is something wrong?
But Leitz told us he worked for the resistance.
"But he didn't tell us about that booby-trap door, did he?"
"And he must have set Hunda up, too."
"That story about the monorail tunnel, it's all a trap."
We've got to tell Hunda and warn him.
"Forbus, we came here to get a sample of Pylene-50 in the hope that someone can devise..."
"Somebody already has, Tarrant."
"These block the effects of Pylene-50, but unfortunately can't reverse them."
And this is the written formula.
- Forbus...
"- Don't waste time thanking me, my friends."
You must hurry.
"- Flight commander wants clearance to launch, sir."
"- All right, go ahead."
"Strike leader, this is Control."
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
And no more car privileges.
Come in.
You look positively orange with loneliness.
"No, I don't see that catching on at all."
What are you doing?
I'm working on my three-person chess game.
"Oh, cool."
Can I play?
It's three-person chess.
Did you bring a friend?
No.
Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess.
Can you believe this guy?
"Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
"No, thank you."
I'm fine.
It's not optional.
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece."
How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey-- the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
"I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me."
"I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself."
"Sheldon, listen to me."
"I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared."
Yellow.
Go ahead.
A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing.
He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Fascinating.
What's in it?
But I'm sure you've got it all.
"Then who did, sir?"
Who else touched the briefcase?
"Sandy, for gosh sakes, if you'd stop worrying about things that aren't important, you wouldn't overlook the things that are."
"Yes, sir."
"I didn't mean to make you angry, sir."
You've already wrecked my evening with that deposit money you forgot.
There was a message waiting for me when I got home.
You should have sent that money to the bank the minute it came in.
"You know our insurance doesn't cover leaving a wad like $45,000 around the office all night."
"But about that $45,000, sir--"
I know you're sorry.
"Well, skip it."
The bank's sending an armored truck to meet me downtown.
They'll take the money off our hands.
"Oh, what are you doing, sir?"
I'm on my way down to the office to turn the money over to them.
"Now goodbye, Sandover."
Go to Phoenix.
[door opens]
[panting]
[sighs]
[footsteps approach]
"Okay, boys, that's it."
Be right with you.
"Hello, I was given this number to reach Miss Krail tonight."
"Oh, Lita, is that you?"
"Lita, I tried to reach you before to tell you I got your message about double checking that cash that came in today."
"No no no, you don't need to do anything about it."
I'll handle it.
Just wanted to say thanks for calling it to my attention.
That's all.
"All along I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return, as your Major Sinclair can confirm."
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shootout."
The shootout?
"No, no, no, no, no."
Although there is still a fatal traffic incident about which we must question Mr Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes."
But complications do occur.
"- Hmm, may I visit him?"
"- Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
"As for Mr Stonebridge and Mr Crawford, tomorrow we will send troops into the desert."
I only pray we find them before the bandits who have his daughter.
"It would be deeply regrettable if all my men brought back, were their two corpses."
"Rest assured, Minister, that if none of them make it back, then the photographs they took at the exchange"
will tell a story that I think most of us would rather keep private.
"Thank you, Minister."
Major.
"Yeah, I've got your back."
Move.
- What is it?
- Arakee.
Drink.
And then we shall eat.
"Come on, get it together."
Do you wish to know how much your father thinks you are worth?
I have no father.
You are all of his world.
He destroys worlds.
Like all men of violence.
Am I that easy to you?
Then...
I think I've really gone crazy.
It's good that things turned out this way.
Don't do celebrity documentaries.
"Just do what you like, investigative programs."
I'll find a job for you.
You're unemployed too.
Who's looking for whose job?
I'm going to get a job too!
"If you get a job, should I sign myself up to you too?"
I don't want to see this and that.
What?
You wouldn't starve me and Jik at least.
"Ahjussi, can't you hire me as you wife?"
What did you just say?
"Starting tomorrow instead of plate-of-water unni, another PD would come and film."
"When you threw the ad-lib today, asking her to date you?"
Everyone knows that you did that to chase her away.
"Our chairman is so furious, saying, 'The goby is jumping and the squid is jumping too!"
What kind of PD is she?
'
He said we can't trust our Sin Joon Young to a psycho PD like that.
I gave them the notice.
"Are you fully satisfied with this now, Joon Young?"
And so in that situation what would plate-of-water unni say?
"'Hey you, cockroach of a guy!"
Are you in your right mind or not!
'
While saying that did she have to just accept it then?
"If so, a mere PD would approach a star that would probably be a bigger mess."
Think about it.
"Whenever you've got anything to sell, whether it's a carriage, a steamboat, or an actress, you've got to spruce it up."
Give it sparkle.
I really believe that this is going to help make our corporation look successful.
I'll wear it.
"Wait a minute- gentlemen, please!"
"Now, mr."
Fisk is a busy man.
He'll see you when he gets time.
He sees everybody.
Now will you hoot owls sit down and stop hooting?
"A man gets rich, and it spreads like the itch."
"Now wait, first- all you inventors, please sit over on that side."
All the inventors.
"Sit down, neighbor, please."
"Hey, what are you?"
I'm just plain hungry.
Hungry?
"Well, everybody that's hungry, you sit on that side, please."
Sit down.
Wait a minute- are you an inventor or are you hungry?
Yes.
"Listen, you inventors, hungry or not, you got to sit over there in the patent office, that's on that side."
"Would you mind sitting down, neighbor, please?"
I trusted mr.
"Fisk, and he sat right there and told me an almighty lie."
"Oh, now, uncle daniel, do you think jim fisk would lie to you for $500,000?"
"Yes, i do."
"Yeah, well, so do i."
"What have you got, son?"
I've got an invention that will save you the bother of carrying around matches.
"It's good for pipes, cigars, almost anything."

RACHEL ROBINSON:
"EARLY ON, THEY LIKED JACK,"
BECAUSE HE WAS BEING A GOOD BOY
AND HE WAS DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO
AND HE WAS KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT.
"AND THE MINUTE HE DECIDED TO DEFEND HIMSELF,"
THEY WOULD CALL HIM UPPITY;
THEY WOULD CALL HIM A LOUD MOUTH TO DISCREDIT HIM.
NARRATOR:
"AFTER BASEBALL, HE WOULD SPEAK OUT TIRELESSLY,"
USING HIS IMMENSE FAME TO PROMOTE EQUALITY
AND CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EVERYWHERE.
BUT IN AN AGE OF PROFOUND SOCIAL UPHEAVAL
"AS HIS INFLUENCE DIMINISHED AND HIS HEALTH DECLINED,"
HE WOULD SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO FIND HIS PLACE
IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
HE HAD ONCE SYMBOLIZED.
"AND HIS HOME, ONCE A HAVEN FROM THE FIGHT OUTSIDE,"
WOULD SEE UNIMAGINABLE SORROW.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK NEVER TALKED ABOUT CARRYING
THE ASPIRATIONS OF OUR RACE AS A BURDEN.
HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT AS...
AS KIND OF OPPORTUNITY.
"AND HE WAS PROUD, VERY PROUD, WHEN HE SUCCEEDED IN SOME WAY"
AND DEVASTATED WHEN HE DIDN'T.
BUT HE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE RACIAL EQUALITY IN AMERICA.
"AND IF WE DIDN'T, IF HE DIDN'T DO HIS PART"
"AND DIDN'T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THEIR PART,"
NO CHANGE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

- In accounting.
"You know, that Mr. Sandover whose dumpy little wife used to be Mr. Devro's boss lady."
- In accounting?
- He's been with us almost 20 years.
Mr. Sellers says he's the only man in the company who's never had an expense-account trip.
"All right, all right."
"You're the #1 spark plug now, so spin the wheels, roll 'em down the runway."
"Your necktie is crooked, Mr. Banks."

"All right, never mind."
"Here, Sandy, you won't need this."
I'm having a briefcase loaded with all the estimates.
"Yes, I expected that, sir."
"I'm taking along some work of my own, that's all."
Oh.
"Well, if you're a little overweight on the plane..."
"I plan to travel by rail, sir."
It's ok.
Well?
"He's gone, sir."

"There, there's a lot..."
"They're the best fuckin thing that happened to music, alright ?"
Show them the rat bit you.
Rat bit me.
What are you guys gonna do with that picture ?
"Well, this is gonna be plaqued and put up in the cracker barrel."
"What we're gonna do, we're gonna have the picture there with like the rest of the groups autographs around there."
It's gonna go up with Gallagher's above the fireplace.
Only with total devotion and love can something like this work.
If I don't have absolute trust in this person.
"And similarly if he doesn't have trust in me, his mistress."
He can't let go completely and can't serve me 100%.
It's a huge sign of trust.
Of course I'm aware that I'm responsible for everything here.
And that can only work if it's based on absolute love.
"Pig, come here."
Make sure you do a good job.
That's enough.
"Thank you, mistress."
I used to be in sales.
"But now, I don't know."
I don't like retail anymore.
You're expected to be.
"like, a machine."
You have to be friendly.
no matter how rude people are.
They can insult you and you go.
"""I don't need this, I don't have to take this."""
"And in sales, work hours keep getting longer."
I don't like that.
So I thought I'd look around and maybe change fields.
I realized I seem to really get along with prostitutes.
"Because, as funny as it may sound, they like me."
"I don't know why, but... with most of them I don't have to pay."
Which is of course very nice.
And I learned from a prostitute pretty much everything I know today to make other women happy.
"So, sit down."
"Yes, master."
"So, let me see."
It's a lovely view.
He already told you he doesn't know anything.
No.
You're the one that said that.
He hasn't asked a damn question.
"Look, I know it doesn't look good, but there's not a law against having a dead snitch in your trunk."
So that's why you killed him?
Because he was a snitch?
"Yeah, that's it."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I killed him, I threw him in my trunk, and then I called you guys."
God damn.
"Be real, man."
"Look, he has an alibi."
All right?
All you have to do is call Donald Cooperman.
That's it.
"We called, and his assistant says he doesn't want to get involved."
"Great, but you still have the photos that show that he was serving Cooperman a subpoena at the exact time that this guy was getting stabbed and put in my client's trunk."
- This guy.
- That's right.
What time was that?
Uh--
You said you knew the exact time.
- Did I?
- We don't know the exact time that this guy was stabbed.
Cool.
Neither do I.
But I would like to know why are there people sticking dead bodies in your client's trunk.
"To frame him, obviously."
We have motive.
Karl Stoltz was investigating two of your clients on a drug deal.
You want me to give you some more motive?
We want to keep it a good school.
Do you know what I mean?
- Yes sir.
"- No, you don't, son."
"You see, I've got these officers here, the school board, the newspapers..."
"the television and a whole lot of nasty, angry parents."
They all want to know something about what happened.
And you're the person who knows that something.
Right now you are standing between...
"me and my ability to keep this good school and I don't like that, son."
I don't like it when people do things to my school.
You get my meaning?
"So, why don't you tell us what was the noise that caused you..."
to come out of the bathroom?
"- Hey, Brian."
How are you doing?
- You actually know my name.
Of course I know your name.
How are they treating you Bri?
Baseball bats?
Electrodes attached to various parts of your anatomy?
Excuse me. I have a class.
J ust remember what happens to snitches.
"- Hey, Brian."
Are you okay?
"- Yes, sure."
I'm really sorry you're the person that has to deal with this.
- lt's no problem.
- Because you know...
"if you saw something, like somebody had a gun, then you should tell them."
"If you don't, you would be part of it and people are really scared, Brian."
"So, you should tell them if you saw anything."
- That's why they stopped and searched me on the road.
- They told me all about you.
- That must have been most interesting.
Most instructive.
I saw the same two in your room when you were having lunch.
- You did?
Why didn't you stop them?
- I thought it over.
One can't monkey about with Scotland Yard men.
I tried to tell you while you were having lunch but you fortunately stopped me.
Why was that fortunate?
Because the man you were having lunch with was another government chap.
He threatened to shoot me if I so much as look at you.
Thank you for telling me this.
"And, now, if you'll excuse me, I won't keep you any longer."
I'm in no hurry.
I haven't come to the most important thing yet.
Don't tell me there are more detectives on my trail.
"There probably are, hundreds."
"Black with them, for all I know."
I must give you one word of advice.
Will you give back those plans?
Get whatever it is you've stolen... and we'll trickle down together and just see those detectives.
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm not.
"I just love you, that's all."
"In fact, if you'll reform, I'll willingly consider marrying you."
- I suppose I should feel flattered.
- You certainly should.
I don't propose to every girl I meet.
Now put on your coat.
- Please leave my coat alone.
Gocha told us to be alert and to shoot everyone and not let anyone escape.
It has only smelt only blood.
But this has smelt our sweat too.
Do you know what will happen if I hack you with this?
Come  hack us now.
Kill us.
Come.
Idiot.
You shot the groom.
Shot them all dead.
They are not your policemen.
"Very honest policemen, as a wonded man if you can do so many things,"
"I wounded you, I can do many things."
"The day I saw your laptop,"
I sent information through the net.
That's why top officers are here.
I know.
"Even if we had planned this operation, this would have been the end."
"In a war, people will die."
We can handle this in the inquiry.
Mind your business.
You go.
"Since your son sent information through the net, we were able to catch a big criminal."
He has done good.
Feel proud of him.
Great job.
I really appreciate you.
"C'mon boys, search the place."
Those who mined diamonds against the law were arrested  punished.
Velu who helped us in this operation was felicitated by the government.
"Moreover, his crimes were pardoned and freed by the court."
Nothing wrong in doing this for a son like you.
I can't sign it.
"Louis, I know this isn't what you wanted, but in my professional opinion, this is the best you're going to do."

"Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a..."
a German communiqué that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
"-Now, to Cairo..."
"-See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts."
Hitler's a nut on the subject.
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.
"And, right now, apparently, there's some kind of German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo."
"Now, we've got some information here, but we can't make anything out of it, and maybe you can."
"""Tanis development proceeding."

"Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?"
"Well, it.."
The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
The Lost Ark?
"Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant."
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
"What do you mean, ""commandments""?"
You talking about the Ten Commandments?
"Yes, the actual Ten Commandments."
"The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing."

"When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon."
In Jerusalem.
Where it stayed for many years.
"Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone."
But why would Betty wanna kill Kentucky?
Maybe she didn't kill Kentucky.
Woolsey handpicked Kentucky to be the new face of Betty's Bees and then she betrayed him.
"Yep, she sabotaged his company and stole his bees."
She played him like Boo Boo the fool.
Boo Boo had it coming.
Woolsey tells me I'm too old and slaps my name on an inferior product.
"Did you know there's now 60 percent less honey in all Betty's Bees honey-based products, including honey?"
"He wants the company, have it, but I'll be damned if he can have my bees."
"Hello, Kitty."
And you.
You're not a temp.
Who are you people?
We're investigators hired by Kentucky's husband to find her killer.
There is no killer.
That's what the police told me.
Can't prosecute a swarm of bees for murder.
You can prosecute Woolsey Nicholls.
I loved Kentucky like a sister.
But if I told the police Woolsey killed her because we sabotaged his company I would go to jail longer than Woolsey would for murder.
Jail might be a safer place.
I was attacked in your office by a swarm of bees.
- I think those were meant for you.
If you loved Kentucky tell the police.
You can't let Woolsey get away.
Woolsey is gonna get away with murder.
Unless you can pull his DNA off those bees.
Oh.
"Please, don't get up."
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Emerson Cod.
I'd like to ask you questions about the murder of Kentucky Fitz.
You're neither and I don't think I like it.
Another drink?
"You pride yourself on it, don't you?"
It's important to you.
Very important.
What?
Being brave all the time.
Loads of physical courage.
"What is this, truth or consequences?"
"You're quite right, let it pass."
I didn't know you were interested.
"It's purely academic, I assure you."
You don't look academic to me.
"Mr McKendrick, it may interest you to know that a great many women are not partial to the superman type."
They prefer a little human weakness.
A little humility.
Look everybody's scared of something.
That coming from you could be quite an admission.
I gather you two gentlemen know each other.
"Pinky, this is Mr McKendrick."
Pleased to meet you.
"Sit down, McKendrick."
Here is the news.
It was announced from Washington today that President Roosevelt has transferred 50 American destroyers to His Majesty's government as part of a Lend Lease grant.
Lend Lease.
"In exchange, leases have been to the United States for the construction of airfields and naval bases in British Commonwealth Territory as part of America's Defence Programme."
Defence.
What are the Yanks defending?
Who's shooting at them?
That's right.
50 stinking tin cans.
Lousy old tubs that ain't been at sea since WW1.
Could I have been swarmed?
In my underwear too.
I could've been swarmed in my underwear.
Hey.
You don't get to put them pictures in my head.
- That's an assault on my imagination.
- What a horrible way to die.
Thousands of stingers stinging you.
Like secrets that don't sting once they keep stinging you until you're bloated and full of pus.
- Who wanted à la mode?
- Ah.
"Well, Kentucky was bloated and full of pus because she was sabotaging Betty's Bees."
"Kentucky had it in for Betty, but who had it in for Kentucky?"
The terrifying bee man.
What if he was made of bees?
That's why she couldn't see his face.
He didn't have one.
What if there's a whole bee-folk society who walk like people?
- You're thinking about how you can train bees to walk in people shapes?
- Yeah.
Ain't no bees walking around in no people shapes.
Kentucky was wiggity-wiggity-whacked.
- With a swarm of bees.
- Smells like an inside job.
Kentucky was talking to someone when Dusty was dropping eaves.
Someone who knew what she was doing and would wanna kill her for it.
"If it is an inside job, we gonna need an inside bee girl."
- No.
- We gotta tap this honey at the source.
Uh-huh.

Officials now confirm she was registered at the Biltmore Hotel on the night of the current Mrs. Collins' disappearance.
Officials urge anyone with information to contact the Sara Collins hotline immediately.
"Thanks, Jeff."
"All right, thank you, Judy."
That was Judy Nash...
"Cap, forget about it."
It's not her.

"And if the answer to my question was,"
"""What are the names of this week's teams?"", you'd be looking for..."
"And as you can see, answers use adjoining cells, can go in any direction."
And no cell is used more than once.
"In round one, as you are looking for answers, after two seconds, letters start to disappear, and as they do, the points go down."
"So the faster you answer, the more you score."
"Be careful - we've laid a few false trails, we've set a few traps."
"So, Lutrophiles, here's your first question."
Buzz in when you think you've found the answer.
Reveal the hive.
Grimsby.
Or...
Is Grimsby there?
"Ooh, I'm not sure it is."
No.
What else is there?
Why should I wait for that?
- Did you find anything?
- Searching the containers takes time.
- Then hire more people.
- It's not people we need.
We're still negotiating with a few less-than-cooperative shipping companies.
- Just solve the problem.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
I've spoken to the Board.
"Everyone wishes you the best, but we have no managing director, prices are dropping, rumours are rife."
"They can voice their complaints to me, otherwise, just do as I ask."
"I'm paying you to do as I ask, so, do it!"
That wasn't necessary.
- Here's the TV script.
- Thank you.
Neither the nanny nor Cart and Emilie's teachers have heard of the gap.
Isn't it just a game they've made up?
- Are they ready'?
- Yes.
The police called.
They advise against doing it.
No.
Come.
You can help save Emilie's life.
- I'm sure your voters will forgive you.
- I've already answered questions.
"As you know, Emilie's kidnapping is closely tied to an old murder case, which your friend, Assistant Public Prosecutor Schuitz was responsible for."
"I was appalled by the whole story, but I have explained our meeting."
- According to a witness...
- The meeting was about Louise Hjelby.
Seifert is totally unreliable.
Is he really the cause of this meeting?
Here´s the situation.
We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus.
We believe he is headed to Los Angeles or is here already.
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area.
"Our only lead is Nina Myers, who´s being brought back to CTU right now."
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers.
Adam´s done a workup on him.
"We have some background, but nothing places him definitively in Los Angeles today."
That´s it?
What about Interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?
"Our data tracking´s a little behind, so we weren´t able to access that report."
Why are we behind?
We didn´t update the European contact logs while I was down.
"- Michelle, you were the ranking agent."
- l didn´t think Europe was a priority.
- Obviously it was.
- There was a lot going on at the time.
All right.
Let´s get back to work.
"Let´s try to ease up on the mistakes, as there are millions of lives depending on us."
Michelle.
- (knocking)
- Come.
I just got off with CTU.
- What´s the status on the virus?
- lt´s not good.
The limited intelligence they have supports their suspicion.
- lt´s on its way to Los Angeles?
"- David, it may already be here."
We should prepare in case they target other cities.
Our people in the security envelope have been alerted. lt´s being handled.
- Have you had a fight?
Scum!

I told him the store is shut.

But I won't get a chance like this ever again.
I don't even know whether I'll ever come back... whether I will have these friends later on

"I mean, whose house do we stay over at?"
"You don't need to have a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
Have a one-night stand.
Get one under you belt.
Do you know that you are the second person to use that expression.
Ever?
"No, not ever."
"God, a one-night stand."
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
"I mean, where would I go, what would I do, go to a singles bar?"
You could.
But that would mean hopping in a time machine and going back to when singles bars existed.
"Well, I mean, where do you go?"
I get most of my action at the grocery store.
Really?
God. 'Cause I go to the Ralph's on Pico and it's all skateboarders and lesbians.
That Ralph's is dead.

I can't remember the last time I left that place alone.
"I have to say, I feel really uncomfortable about this."
"Well, I need company."
It would seem too whorey if I came to a grocery store to pick up a guy alone.
And bringing your brother along makes it seem wholesome?
And why are you even doing this?
I just want to feel like a woman again.
"Help me be a woman again, Matthew."
You're on.
May the best lawyer win.
I still can't believe he got fired.
"I mean, the whole time I was covering for him,"
I never thought Larissa would actually... do it.
What is it you're not saying?
Why can't you just admit it?
Admit what?
You knew Bennet was on shaky ground.
What'd you think was gonna happen when you took his story?
That she'd yell at him or something?
"And I'm sorry, but Bennet was never actually going to that party, which means he would have been fired anyway."
I just seized an opportunity.
Anyone would have.
No.
A lot of people wouldn't.
I wouldn't.
"Come on, Carrie."
Admit it.
You went for the jugular.
"You wanted something so bad, you didn't care someone else might get hurt in the process."
It's not that simple.
I didn't mean for Bennet to get hurt.
But he did.
I don't expect you to understand.
You never had to claw your way to get something.
"But if I'm going to be a writer,"
I'm gonna have to work my butt off
- and fight for it.
"- Oh, come on."
"It's not like you're some poor, struggling artist."
You're an intern at a magazine who lives with her father and doesn't have to worry about money or a roof over her head.
"From what I understand, the Left Cholla Navy has researched and developed various ways to fight the enemy at sea."
Then...
Silence!
"Sir, this is not something you should be angry about."
Yi Soon-shin is not our enemy.
We should learn from each other and work together to make the navy stronger.
"Silence, I said!"
Go back to your camps and build some decent galleys for now.
"Whether we fight on land or at sea, we do not need any help from Yi Soon-shin!"
I will fight my own way!
What's the most important thing for an oarsmen?
Teamwork!
You must work together to make the ship glide forward!
Is that clear!
Cadence and rhythm!
Do you hear me!
I... have a difficult request.
"I hate to do this, but..."
I'll do it.
I'll get on board with my men.
It's only right that I should row the new Turtle Ship.
Young-gap...!
"That's your request, isn't it?"
Don't worry.
I was going to volunteer if you didn't ask.
The other guys will refuse to do it no matter how safe you say it is.
And there's another reason why I have to do this.
Those poor boys that died out there...
I have to see them off to the peaceful place.
"Once they see the Turtle Ship zipping through the waves, they will finally feel peace."
I should be the on the see them off.
Tomorrow?
- An elderly man blowing his hands.
Fore!
It landed near hole 6.
- Did I hit that family?
- They shouldn't bring the pram here.
"Go, go, go!"
We're in for it.
Take it easy.
- So Davis was wrong after all?
"- Well, I never did believe him."
And only a few yards from where he thought the tomb was.
- That's right.
"- Well, you deserve it, Monsieur Carter."
I shall come and inspect the tomb tomorrow.
This is a most excellent day for our department and for the country.
I shall arrange storage facilities at the Cairo Museum.
No.
It's far too early to involve the museum.
"Whatever we do, nothing must be rushed."
These things are precious.
I understand.
All care will be taken.
I'm putting together a team of experts.
I've already contacted the Metropolitan Museum as well as our own British specialists.
This is a huge task.
Please do not forget there are national interests to be considered.
That may be so but this must be preserved for all posterity.
That is far more important than the concerns of any single nation.
"And as His Lordship's field director, I intend to ensure that the correct procedures are followed at all times."
I hope that's clear.
"This is an Egyptian tomb, Monsieur Carter."
No more mozzarella mama...
Since I moved to LA I haven't really had a substantial boyfriend.
I seem to gravitate towards casual relationships of convenience.
Sometimes though I do wish for something more meaningful.
In Los Angeles most people feel like they've never actually arrived.
There's always this chase for something bigger and better.
Consequently no one puts down roots.
No one settles down.
It's like living in this state of perpetual vagrancy.
I want some roots... at least I think I do.
Oh my God did you... did you hear?
Maybe.
"2012, there is this huge planet that is going to crash into earth and kill... everyone!"
Oh you mean like the movie?
"No, I don't mean like the movie."
This is real Dale!
The movie is based on the facts.
The planet... is called Nadie!
"I don't know how he got his name and why it isn't six or eight, but"
Seven is my colleague... roommate...
and closest confidant.
And I don't think I'm outing him by saying
Seven won't be taking any girls home.
It's all over the internet I'm obsessed with it.
I can't stop reading.
It's kind of scary don't you think?
I mean the end of the world Dale.
I don't know if I can sleep tonight?
Bowie... you wanna snuggle with me?
Huh?
Come here.
I'm taking your dog.
And she doesn't let him get away with anything.
She was his wife when he met her.
They're the blue stabilizers.
Ugh!
See?
"Yeah, well, it's just boring now, isn't it?"
They're boringers.
They're blue...
Boringers.
"Doctor, how come she can fly the TARDIS?"
You call that flying the TARDIS?
Ha!
"River Song is better at operating the TARDIS than the Doctor is and, for the first time, you see the Doctor actually being quite put out by that."
Charted the ship to its destination and...
Parked us right alongside.
"""Parked"" us?"
You haven't landed.
Of course we've landed.
I just landed her.
But...
It didn't make the noise.
What noise?
"You know, the --"
It's not supposed to make that noise -- you leave the brakes on.
"Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise."
I love that noise.
"I like that the classic noise that we all associate with the TARDIS, the fact that my ringtone is that noise, turns out that it's a mistake."
I imagine that that was just a nice little Steven Moffat gem for people who have watched the show for so long.
[ Wheeze
"What's great about river is that she's this mysterious character and, generally, when the mystery is taken away from a character, they become less interesting."
River becomes more interesting.
"A lovely twist is when River Song is about to be shot by Amy Pond and, suddenly, River Song says,"
"We got Bossman in the cabana getting his balls rubbed, and you're out here asking for the fucking tartare?"
You know the surgeon general just said that stress is more dangerous than smoking?
Maybe you should think about that.
"We miss Wayne, we're fucked."
"Oh, there he is."
It's about fucking time.
Look at him saunter.
"God, that must have been some release, huh?"
"Oh, all right here we go."
"( chuckling ) Long way from home, Dorothys."
I'm gonna need you to reconsider cutting Vernon.
"I've been spending far too much time and getting far too little in returns, Spencer."
"I know I said this before, but this time, it's guaranteed."
Vernon's out of the weed business.
Nothing like getting a guarantee for the second time.
"Ah, no, that first time was a promise."
This is a guarantee.
Totally different thing.
"Bossman, come on, he's a good kid."
"Hell, I know he is."
I'm actually quite fond of him.
Do you gentlemen have any idea how difficult it is to operate the greatest brand in sports?
"You own the New England Patriots, too?"
I'm totally kidding.
"No, we don't."
People are always looking for new ways to knock us down.
"( chuckles ) Yeah, I can relate to that one."
"Hmm, some would say you have it coming, though."
Word is you've been sniffing in the tall weeds with a short snout.
I'm not quite too sure what that even means.
Me either.
"I've never heard that one, no."
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
I'm sure of it.
Why's that?
"Grandma doesn't like America, and it's only natural."
"After all, Grandpa was killed by the atomic bomb."
I think he's right.
"You see, none of us and none of our parents know about war."
As for the atomic bomb...
"Sure, we've all heard about it."
But it meant nothing more than a sort of little scary fairy tale.
We never really understood the feelings of the people... who had the atom bomb dropped over their heads.
We never stopped to think.
Look at my mother.
"Just by being told that there's a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited."
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.
Big Sis!
"Here, eat these."
I'm really pleased... that you are so concerned about me.
I'm very grateful.
"But then, it was a long time ago when I felt bitter about America."
It's been more than 45 years since Grandpa died.
"Now, I don't particularly like... or dislike America."
It's all because of war.
War is to blame.
During the war many Japanese died... and many Americans also died.
Listen... because of a man called Suzujiro or whatever...
I don't think it's right for you to talk badly about your parents.
-He is again threatening me
"You are alright, you have no cardiac problems"
"I also know that But if I go out, I will be killed"
I will lie here for 10 days Say I have a cardiac attack
This was a ruse done by me Is he showing me the same trick?
"No point in trusting you guys, who fear death"
- Call up Palayamkottai Kasilingam

Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
Yeah.
That isn't true!
"Okay, that's totally true."

Mr. Gueermo?
What?
!
We're from child-protective services.
There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child.
What?
!
Who the hell's been saying that?
!
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
His name is Stan Marsh.
You better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car 'cause there's a world of hurt about to come your way.
Mr. Gueermo we need to come in and have a word with your son.
"Oh, by all means."
"You got the balls to come in here, do it."
Do it.
"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly."
"We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes, if that's okay, and just maybe--"
"Yeah, there it is!"
"Now I know you're looking at me like that's a punk move, but I ain't a punk, I'm a survivor."
"It's a difference, okay?"
"""'Cause if I see a 7'16"" nigga come in here right now, talking about he robbing us..."
I'm switching sides.
I'm just letting you know.
"He gonna be like, ""Everybody, get on the ground."""
"I'm gonna be like, ""Yeah, everybody get on the ground."""
"This is a stickup, bitch."""
'Cause I ain't no punk.
"I'm a survivor, you feel me?"
Even in my woman selection.
That's why I can never mess with somebody like Serena Williams.
Mm-mm.
"That's a big woman, ain't it?"
"She look like the type, as soon as you put your thing in her, she will clinch up every muscle in her body and just detach your penis, right?"
"Somehow suck it up all the way through her body and then spit it out in her hand like,"
"""Pfft, take your little dick back, nigga."""
And would have to sit there and then pick it up and walk off with it.
'Cause you ain't gonna fight her.
Look at her.
She's bigger than an Avatar.
She's humungous.
Mutombo wouldn't sleep with her.
He'd be like...
"""No, no, no, no."
"That bitch, not in my house, no, no, no, no."""
"Speaking of big stuff, I'm sorry, y'all."
I gotta get this out of my pocket.
Look at this big-ass phone.
This don't make no sense.
Y'all remember when phones--
I got ear cancer right now.
Can't save the world.
Not trying to.
How long have you known rosie?
"2 years,give or take a fight or three."
What is he claiming?
That mrs.
Neuwirth could have been saved.
There's a chance of settlement.
I don't want to settle if it's going to leave a cloud of doubt over this hospital.
"Code zero,possible hijacking,assailants unknown."
You've got to move your belongings and find a permanent residence.
You don't have to respond to everything they throw at you.
"Yes,I do."
Maybe you can defend every action you've ever taken.
Some day you must tell me what that's like.

"We start with ""el paseo,"" the stroll."
No other dance connects 2 people more closely than the tango.
Emotionally as well as physically.
"There is skill, communication, and intimacy like none other."
Thought tennis was a gentleman's game.
"Hey,too bad you didn't break your arm before the match."
"Why don't you piss off,you dick!"
"Or would you like another forehead across the head, 'cause you broke the wrong arm."
Hold still.
That's the only shot you made today.
That's it.
Don't move.
I'm outta here.
You promised.
"No,I promised I'd get physical therapy not public humiliation."
T urned away and ran.
I followed him
"He kept on running, and I kept on chasing"
T o where?
I was after him for more than a mile
Then he got on a horse and went east
And you lost him?
"Y es, it's all true"
Every word is so true!
Boss!
The one you met at the pharmacy is Fan San
He's one of the Three Devils.
Very bad tempered
Very skillful with his duel blades
His way of sword is mean and nasty!
"The second one is Zhou Sanzhao, a womanizer"
Very good with dart and secret weapons
Never misses a target!
The leader of the three is Y an Qingwang
"Ruthless and insidious, most skillful of the three"
"His Leopard boxing is marvelous, his plait can kill"
They're the parasites of the martial arts field
One of these days...

"Brother Jin, you mentioned that 3 years ago"
You've broken my Master's rib bones
Is it true?
You can ask him yourself
According to my Master's way of boxing
There're 3 stances that can protect the chest
How did you break his rib bones?
Which three stances?
What do you mean?
The instrument for your ship's destruction has already been placed aboard her: : :
And by a member of your own crew:
[Laughs]
"Discover him in time, and you will have won all:"
Reardon:
"The man we picked up here was a fake, wasn't he?"
And Wilma... the real Wilma...
took him on board the Searcher:
And it was he who was able to tell this creature how to duplicate our ship:
[Laughs] You are indeed worthy of admittance to my masters' planet!
Such intuition is a rare thing:
"We are sick and tired of playing your stupid game, old man:"
"I want some answers from you, and I want them now!"
How is Reardon going to destroy the ship?
How's he gonna do it?
"Oh, perhaps not so intelligent after all:"
Anger and violence do not provide solutions:
"Tell me, old man:"
I overestimated you:
[Clicking Tongue]
What a pity:
[Explosion]
Gone like the others:
We gotta get back to the ship:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Yes, Buck:"
What have you found?
"We're returning to the ship, Admiral:"
You've got a saboteur on board:
Even with a family.
Now I'm just filling in time.
"What have you got, Jack?"
A medal in a drawer.
I should think hard before you hold your hand up for the sacrificial lamb.
You know where I live.
"Always keep your door locked, George."
People get mugged this way.
"Jack, you know I'm not allowed to talk to you."
I don't want to be landed in it.
"Well, neither did I, did I?"
"But I am, right up to my neck."
I didn't ask to work with them.
"No, but I'm bloody glad you are."
"Come on, what's green mean, green, green...."
Sheridan's adamant that he wasn't at the hotel that day.
He was at home with the wife.
A very handy missus for alibis.
So how was Superintendent Bailey?
"Well, I'd like to be able to say that she's every sort of cow under the sun, but unfortunately I think she's quite a good copper."
"Now that Mrs. Sheridan gave quite a good performance as a woman scorned, and she's his only alibi."
She was dodgy once you'd better check the hotel.
I have.
I've been on the phone.
The manager clearly knew
"Mrs. Barr, and Sheridan by sight."
"The description of the man she was with that day is a bit hazy, but it wasn't Sheridan."
What about the bill?
"I've got it here somewhere, I think."
Here we are.
"It's for a meal, and a double room for the night, he thinks they left by six that evening."
"Oh well, thank you very much George, well done."
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
Stop worrying.
She'll recover her mood pretty quick.
"Still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"If she starts to say that she won't go again, it'll be a serious problem."
"""I received your telegram."
"""Clark will come right away, Suzujiro. """
I knew that telegram would mess things up.
Americans do resent being reminded of the atom bomb.
Japanese-Americans are especially sensitive about it.
I think they feel embarrassed by the Americans.
I wonder why Clark is coming here?
"Well, that's..."
He's probably coming... to wind up this matter once and for all.
I see.
To tell us to forget the whole thing.
"By the way, I guess I must be going, now."
Is that how I seemed?
Yes.
"Kim Yang is a descendant of Kim Heon-chang, who led the uprising in Mujinju."
"Kim Heon-chang tried to overthrow the imperial household, and ascend to the throne."
But the punishment for treason is death of all family members.
My father saved Kim Yang.
He learned to survive even after going from being a Jingol noble to the descendant of a treasonous criminal.
He would do anything to survive.
I do not wish to keep him near me.
Did you find out?
"Yes, the man at the harbor was the new Mujinju governor."
What is the new governor doing in Chunghae?
He came to pay his respects to the regent.
Did you call for me?
I need to go to Mujinju.
It would be too dangerous.
Why would you want to go to Mujinju?
I must meet with Madam Jami and seek her help.
It will be useless.
She coldly turned the master down when he asked her for help.
I won't leave her alone if she refuses to help us.
Who's there?
It has been a long time.
What do you think you are doing?
How could you show up in Mujinju under the circumstances?
Do you plan to harm me?
This was the only way to see you.
Do not worry.
I don't mean to harm you.
It upset me very much when I heard that Master Yi was killed at the hands of Jang Bogo.
Why did you come to see me?
I need you to help me.
Ears boxed.
"Punished with everlasting destruction,"""
"Thessalonians, 1:9."
Joke.
"And, obviously, playing the gramophone when you'd said he wasn't to needs a punishment."
He's getting a punishment.
"""Correct thy son and he shall give thee rest,"" Proverbs, 28:17."
We're on the same tram tracks here.
I don't believe in God.
"It's just that he had this surprise for you, and I was going to take him out to tea, possibly the Kardomah, because he's been a help to me."
I've got this leg.
Lack of.
What surprise?
It's a photograph of Baker.
I took a little snap of him.
I borrowed a Box Brownie from a chap in my digs.
He didn't want you to think you had to buy the...
The big one because that's going to be sizeable.
"So I thought, after the recording, with it being your day off, we could get the photo, and then maybe go somewhere, as I say, like the Kardomah."
Have egg on toast or beans on toast or toast.
Make a day of it.
He's a good little lad.
You know he's saving up to buy you the record.
I don't suppose you want a cup of tea with a nonbeliever.
"Well, you believe in tea, and, to me, that's only just outside the Holy Trinity."
"Our Lord, Holy Spirit, Jesus, Tea."
Go left and cut through.
It saves you five minutes.
Much appreciated.
So we'll see him tomorrow on his correct tram at the correct time.
You will.
I'll see him off before work.
Very good.
- What's he done?
"(Stephen) Peter, explain."
"Well, I think this is what it is."
"When a director directs a film, and, like, say if the studio interfere and they re-edit it and the director disowns the film, they can choose to put Alan Smithee instead of their real name."
- Absolutely right.
Absolutely right.
Yes.
- (applause)
"Alan Smithee is the name used when directors disown a film, either because they've lost control of the final cut, or it's simply too awful to admit to."
"Smithee's oeuvre include such classics as Hobgoblins II,"
"Boggy Creek III, Hellraiser IV and, most famously, Dune, where he codirected with David Lynch."
"So, very well done."
How did you know about that?
You just knew?
I...
"Well, Tony Kaye did that - tried to do that."
- (Stephen) With American History X.
- Yeah.
"And I never saw American History X because I didn't see any of the first nine, you know, so..."
"Oh, you literate fellow."
"Now, The Boy on a Dolphin isn't a Smithee film,"
- but it did star the very short matinee idol...
- (elephant trumpets)
- Alan Ladd.
- (Stephen) Yes.
Another half point to take you up to a full one point for your two splendid intrusions.
- Sophia Loren was in it.
I've actually seen it.
- Very good.
And what can you tell me about the making of the film that's quite interesting?
(laughter)
# Rock you #
# Sing it #
# We will we will... #
"Hey, Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
I joined the basketball team.
I gave up singing and dancing forever.
I'm just not into it.
You gave it up?
That's right.
"You know, sometimes you just have to go with what your heart tells you."
There's things we're all good at and we can't just keep them bottled up inside.
# 'Cause you got to do what you wanna do #
# Don't let nothin' get in your way #

# He was unhappy #
# 'Cause he just wanted to play ball #
# But he finally got the courage #
# To answer his heart's call #
# Just like me all I ever wanted #
# Was to sing and dance #
# And now that I stood up for my dream #
# I finally have the chance #
# You gotta do what you wanna do #
# Even if other people #
# Don't really want you to #
# True girl you know it's true #
# That the thing you want to do #
# Is the thing that you should do #
# Some kids think I'm strange # # 'cause I like studying for an exam #
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
People who cared for you all your life.
They always seem to come in the time when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
"I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there."
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up to the restaurant.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fucking phone."
Now you understand?
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.
You know that kid from the city we were talking about?
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody."
I know where he is.
He's hiding now.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
That way they got nothing.
Go ahead.
Ahem.
You say that the parlors and the dining saloons will be done in solid mahogany?
"Then, mr."
"Howard, all our furniture will be covered with empire plush an inch thick."
"That's right, gentlemen."
"Oh, excuse me, uncle."
Admiring our doorknobs?
No.
I was just coming to ask you if that thimble - rigging vanderbilt's got a hand in this.
The names of our directors will be announced shortly.
Are you in cahoots with that stonington crowd?
Hand and glove.
They've given us all their trade.
I heard you call me your enemy.
"Why, that there just stabbed me to the core."
I'm a pious man.
There ain't an ounce of hatred in my whole carcass.
"Why, mr."
"Fisk, i love my neighbor just as i love myself."
"In that case, uncle daniel, you won't harbor any grudge if we run you out of business."
I forgive you for the harsh words.
"The golden rule brought me to your door, and i'd feel like a heathen if i didn't try to open your eyes to the bottomless pit that's yawning for your fool's gold."
Ahem.
"Good day, mr."
Fisk.
"Good day, sir."
"Ahem, good day."
"You can't run boats no cheaper than me, because i'm losing money every day!"
My steamboats ain't making a cent!
I'm going to give you a chance to save money.
You can buy my boats.
"Matt, please listen to me."
No!
"No, I should've known you'd go behind my back."
"Okay, but I have a long list of people seriously considering adopting them."
- I ain't interested!
- Why not?
"Because, quite frankly, I can save time and money sending them to auction."
"Matt, please, I don't believe you!"
"Look, these horses, they could have great homes."
There are people willing to pay for them.
The end result is the same.
There's still money in your pocket.
"Okay, here's the deal."
I'm a reasonable man.
- Okay...
- Do whatever you want with them...
"But... tomorrow morning, they go to the highest bidder, be it the glue factory or someone who wants to adopt."
"So... go ahead and rally your troops, but I'll be the one making the final decision."
All right.
I understand your husband works in Vancouver.
"- Um, how often is he home?"
"- He travels for work, but that doesn't put a strain on the relationship."
A strain?
Why do you use that word?
"No, no."
I said there isn't... a strain.
Moving on.
"Um, let's discuss Georgie's recent injury."
Can you take me through how that actually happened?
Georgie takes trick riding lessons and she was practicing in our ring.
"You know, I'm surprised someone as young as Georgie's"
- doing such a dangerous sport.
you used to work for my team.
You were helping round up all those old mutes.
What changed?
You got religion?
I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys and track one more special mute for me.
I'm not helping you.
you'd say that.
But I got a theory that people don't really change.
Beware of the light.
I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.
Beware of the light.

"Next time you miss a payment, ladies, we'II bury you alive in matching wicker coffins."
Am I dreaming this?
"What do you think, hilary?"
Is Joyce dreaming?
"Were you on the receiving end of cunnilingus from Robert KiIroy silk, Joyce?"
You...you just blew up The Wicker Barn.
"technically, Joyce, it was actually you who blew it up."
"I, I..."
"That's it, Joyce."
Let it all out.
Those women could have been killed.
"Goodness me, no."
LiIIian can blow the door off a Smeg fridge without so much as damaging an organic vine tomato.
Why?
Why did you do it?
"Let me ask you a simple question, Joyce."
Why did you move to little Stempington?
"Jeremy was posted here and, can't quite believe I'm saying this now, but..."
Yes?
"When we came to look around, I fell in love with the place."
Oh.
Because it's clean?
Because there's no graffiti?
Because there are no delinquent teenagers sniffing toilet Duck in the arcade?
And how d'you think it stays that way?
"Ooh, hello, Wendy, love."
Is that a My little Pony lunch box?
"Pop in the back and sit next to Auntie MiIIie, darling."
"You see, now your fingerprints are all over this little box, Joyce, you're the prime..."
"No, you're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn."
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, gosh, you don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the cIick-cIink for the next ten years, do you?"
"I don't know why the second, I was a bit taken aback."
He probably meant some comedy role.
"In the end, he made the film without me."
He's a laureate and I don't know what else.
I remembered him once when I was in a bad situation.
"Without money and without hope, and then I realised all the things I could have been, all I could have done."
"That time I noticed a newspaper on the ground, I just pushed it open with my foot and read:"
Krej¨¨¨ªk has become a laureate.
I thought:
"He got twenty thousand, and I'm just rushing around here."
"Mrs Gerta, tune that G!"
is that G alright by you?
Can you hear it?
"- l can't tune it, how am I...?"
- lt must be possible to tune it.
"Yes, but not straight away!"
You should do it before rehearsals.
"Get ready... slacken it... slacken it more, more... lt's okay now."
"That's enough, thank you!"
"If we'd had the kettledrums last time, it'd go better today."
But you have to come to rehearsals occasionally.
"I'm not cross, but I have to remind you."
Once again!
Slightly quicker tempo.
I'll set the tempo.
"One, two, three!"
"- Are you listening, Mi?"
ko?
- l'm listening.
When did you get to know Gerta?
"She used to play, that was long ago... I always had a feeling for music."
A girls' orchestra was playing in a coffee house in Prague.
"Oh, then you approve?"
"Yes, but... you can do better than that."
There's still not enough sport in killing me with a sword.
I know.
That will be dull.
We'll have to have something more fanciful.
"Let me see... a hunt, a royal hunt-- predator against predator."
"Now, you may go hide in the forest-- anywhere you like-- and I shall seek."
"How does that strike you, Captain?"
"It strikes me... very well... but you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane."
Why not up the stakes?
The stakes?
Yes.
"While we're playing our game, free my ship."
Let it continue on its way.
"In return,"
I'll give you a contest you'll remember.
Always back to your ship.
"Oh, well... if it will add spice to the pursuit..."
"I accept your terms, Captain."
"[ Trelane ] Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly."
Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
At your convenience.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, this is Kirk."
Can you hear me?
[ Static ]
Get the ship away as fast as you can.
I'll try and give you the time you need.
Can you hear me?
Aha!
Enterprise...
I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth.
Then you've been looking in on the doings 900 years past.
"Oh, really?"
Have I made an error in time?
How fallible of me.
"Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home."
I'm quite proud ofthe detail.
General Trelane--
"Retired, sir."
Just Squire Trelane now.
And you may call me squire.
"Yes, I rather fancy that."
For what purpose... have you imprisoned us here?
Imprisoned?
Nonsense.
You're my guests.
"You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society."
You came by at the most propitious moment.
"I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest."
"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest."
"When we do battle, it's because we have no choice."
"That's the official story, eh?"
I must ask you to let us go back.
I wouldn't hear of it.
You shall join me in a repast.
"I want to learn all about your feelings on war, killing, and conquest."
Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?
Not yet.
"Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle."
"DeSalle, did you say?"
Un vrai Francais?
"My ancestry is French, yes."
"After Everett had abused me,"
"Carrington sang me this really, really beautiful tune, and everybody... everybody just went just deadly silent and I sat there going, ""Oh."""
"Oh, my God, I think he likes you."
"I do, seriously."
I don't think he does.
"No, I don't think he does, no."
"Oh, chaperone at 12:00."
"Next time, there's trouble in paradise."
A beautiful stranger arrives.
"I am a bit flirtatious, but, hey, rules are made to be broken."
A handsome rival returns.
And I think Mr. Carrington will break my heart.
"There are fisticuffs galore, and finally the gloves come off."
The thing with very good girls is that when they're bad...
They're very bad.
They're very bad.

"Prize student at Courtaulds, several major exhibitions, two paintings in the National Gallery."
"He was knocking on the door big-time, then he disappeared."
I thought he was dead.
Maybe.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I used to deny that I was sick.
"I would go off my meds, not work my program, try and white-knuckle it."
And I thought I was gonna spend the best years of my life in a psych hospital.
But I committed myself to recovery.
"And, no, I don't always like going to group."
And I hate that I have to check in with my psychiatrist all the time.
And I certainly don't like the side effects of the meds.
But it works.
And it is so worth it.

I assumed that Sebastian came to you before he came to me.
"Truth is, I'd offered the position to Gregorio first."
And she turned you down?
"Wasn't the right fit for her, I guess."
"So when Sebastian surprised me, said he wanted to become an agent, I..."
"Dwayne, I'm not mad at you or Sebastian."
I always knew he'd come out of his shell sooner or later.
"The truth is,"
I think you need to worry more about
"Sebastian driving you crazy in the field, if I were you."
(laughs) Good possibility of that.
"Come on, go."
You got your hands full.
"You don't have to worry about me, too."
"I always got time for that, Loretta."
(sighs)
"There must be over $100,000 in here, huh?"
Then you'll see a smaller passageway.
"Captain, what are you doing?"
There's one more person I have to find.
Guards!
"After all that time I spent looking for you, all I had to do was wait here."
Shields down to 23 percent.
We've got to get out of their weapons range.
Scan one more time for the away team.
There's no sign of them.
Prepare to break orbit.
Wait!
Set a course bearing 219 mark 47.
"Where are you taking us, Mr. Kim?"
There's a large electrical storm over the northern magnetic pole.
Is giving our sensors some trouble.
It should do the same for theirs.
- A blind spot.
- Exactly.
"If we maintain our position directly above the storm, their sensor net may not be able to keep an accurate lock on our position."
How long do you think this'll work?
The storm's already dissipating.
A few more minutes?
I'll take every second I can get.
"I must say I'm impressed, Caylem."
You never made it this far before.
"Every so often, he goes on one of his missions... to rescue his wife."
She's been dead for 12 years.
Lies.
Lies...
lies!
Sometimes...he gets all the way up to the front gate.
We send him on his way and allow him to serve as a reminder of just how futile it is to challenge us.
I don't think I ever closed my mouth in this movie.
It's hard not to laugh when you're standing next to me with your mouth open like that.
It's such a good choice though.
"This is the first thing we shot on the movie, this performance."
- That's right.
- The second thing was this scene...
And then Rafi normally comes down and kisses a guy.
It just cuts away right when it happens.
And that guy was so excited.
He had to kiss that guy and it didn't make it in.
- They kissed a lot.
- That guy was so excited when...
We couldn't stop them from kissing after a certain point.
"Mike, I love your face when you do that."
Your were so pissed.
I like the Jerk Offs sign in the back.
That's Lite-Brites.
Those were some of my favorite things.
"Dave Doernberg, our production designer, dug out the Lite-Brite."
- I love Lite-Brite.
- He doesn't do that for every motion picture he works on.
This is the first thing of our friendship that we ever filmed.
Yeah.
"Watching this scene, like, this is where we all got to know each other."
This is where l...
I hadn't ever met Jonny or seen him in anything.
And he didn't say a word in this sequence.
"He's standing in the crowd staring at Rafi, but I learned so much about him just watching him from the stage."
"- But you met him at rehearsals, right?"
"Yeah, I mean..."
"But still, you know, it was kind of..."
We were just acquainted.
Mother... you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?
"Tonight's dinner was quite a spread, but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?"
Because the grownups' chatter wasn't enjoyable.
Let's eat their souvenir.
Tateo... don't you find it strange?
Why do they hide everything about Grandpa?
"To put it nicely, they do that out of consideration for Suzujiro and Clark."
"And to put it not nicely, it's sort of a diplomatic tactic and calculation."
"To put it straight, they don't want to ruin the relationship... with that rich family that they've suddenly got."
Hold on.
You mean that Grandma is just being used as an excuse?
That's terrible.
That's the reality of being a grownup.
"Still, I hate it."
Can you take it?
Me?
Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.
"At any rate, the pineapple farm is tremendously vast."
It has eight thousand and some hundred acres.
There are six huge chimneys soaring up from the canning factory.
There is this huge swimming pool in the patio of the house.
Clark's wife got a swimsuit out for me to use.
"But you see, I can't swim."
"And Clark took us on a tour of the factory, too."
Did you know the factory's agency is in Tokyo?
I know that.
They've got agencies in every big city in the world.
"Tell me, what is Clark's wife like?"
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.
"He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York."
"The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport."
"They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days."
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
[soft dramatic music]
?
?
"For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life I'd been allowed to see."
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
"I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there."
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
[violin music]
?
?
"My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues."
I figured I'd start at the top:
the guy with the glasses.
?
?
[dog barking] [chuckles] Mr. Johnson.
Good to meet you.
"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you."
You're Lou's son?
Yes.
"Generations go by quickl y, don't they?"
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
Really?
"Yell, think of anybody else."
and there was coverage on the troops in Afghanistan.
She swears to me that she saw me.
"After that point, she became obsessed with politics."
And that's when she first saw you.
The man that was gonna bring Daddy home.
"And when I finally did come home, I realised that.."
I'm not her hero anymore.
So I guess I just figured that I'd try to help protect the man that is.
"Well, if she saw you today, Cale, she'd be proud of you."
You know how when they're young and they come running up to you..
"and they hug you and they're shouting ""Daddy"".."
"and all of a sudden, one day, that just stops?"
Yeah.
I'd give anything for that hug just one more time.
"You know, my daughter, she's 15 years old, her name is Amber."
You know what she wants for her birthday?
A belly button ring.
Belly button ring.
What parent is equipped for that?
Daughters.
What'shappening?
"Attention, attention."
"Everyone below Calico T11, please clear the ﬂoor immediately."
Put the president onscreen.
"Mr. President, Delta Force entered Washington airspace."
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron on the line.
"You're online, sir!"
"What do you have for us, colonel?"
We developed this plan independent of the Secret Service.
We'll use the superstructure of the city to mask our approach.
What if they start killing hostages?
They're dead anyway if this fails.
♪ He's dead ♪
"Coming up, a cat fight over a parking spot, [struggles] Get off of me!"
- And...
- I'm gonna kill you all!
A criminal gets his slate wiped clean.
[Screams]
What is your problem?
Bitch!
"You know, there are some things that just aren't worth fighting for."
- Don't touch me!
"- Right, that's it!"
Like a parking spot.
But don't tell that to Brenda.
"When it came to the road, she was a ticking time bomb."
"The whole parking lot, and there's not one frickin' spot!"
"For people who truly experience intermittent explosive disorder, there usually is an escalation of events, so someone cutting you off in traffic, or taking your parking spot, may not seem like a big deal to you or me,"
"but for someone with this disorder, uh, it flips them into a state that they can't control."
[Sighs]
[Growls]
Then Amy slipped into a spot she'd been patiently waiting for.
"Oh, hell no!"
And Brenda went off.
"Well, are you gonna move your car?"
What the hell?
What are gonna do?
"This is my boss' car, you crazy lady!"
Maybe you should tell your boss why you didn't move your car.
What is your problem?
- Ah!
- I said get-- get off of me!
That's how two chicks start fighting over a parking spot.
[Struggling]
"Just a little fucked-up jumble of misdirected, immature, poly-sexuality and pure, arrogant, impotent rage."
So...
"What you got, big boy?"
Get off me.
"You don't know a fucking thing about me, you sanctimonious cunt."
"But since we're playing the guessing game, let's make a few assumptions."
"A divorced, lonely, middle-aged lecturer, who lives alone"
- and gets his rocks off...
- You're really fucking...
Gets his fucking rocks off trying to sleep with fucking first years.
Other hobbies include intimidation and furtive masturbation.
I bet you thought you'd died and gone to heaven when you got here.
Your own office and all the students you could eat.
- Let go of me.
- Animus.
"It means spirit, courage, passion,"
wrath.
This is mine.
Who the fucking hell do you think you are?
"I'm a bad dream, mate."
I'm you before you shrivelled and died.
And I don't wanna go where you've been.
"So in answer to your earlier question, you should've given me a place here."
I'd have been the best student you'd ever had.
Here he comes.
"Welcome back, Tony."
"Congratulations, Tony."
"Good work, sir."
Enjoy.
"The pleasure is all yours, sir."
The pleasure is all yours.
You're not coming?
"What are you talking about, for Christ's sake?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"There haven't been more than 1 00 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there.
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.
In other words: normal.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
I mean to L.A.
"No, I...."
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
"When I touch your forehead, open your eyes."
"Are you comfortable, Regan?"
Hello?
"To the people in The Dark Knight shooting, my heart goes out to them."
"Anybody that's lost their life to gun violence or any artillery, my heart goes out to them."
It's not a good thing.
But I be thinking... about that Dark Knight thing.
"And, uh, there couldn't have been no hood Black people there, right?"
"'Cause they would've had they guns ready, right?"
"Like, as soon as he pulled his thing out, they'd be like,"
"""What's your problem, dog?"
"""You better go somewhere with that bull, bro."
"""We've been waiting two months to see this movie, all right?"
"You better go shoot up Ice Age 4."""
"And then in the Boston bombing, they couldn't even get no Black people 'cause we was already finished with the race, so..."
"We was at IHOP just eating a short stack, looking at the damn-- Like, ""What?"""
"""When in the hell did this happen?"""
"""This Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity good as a bitch though, I'll tell you that."""
And people always say the same thing when bad things happen.
"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God!"""
This is my impression of a concerned white woman.
"""Oh, my God!"
"""Why do people do such things?"
"Oh, my God, Karen!"""
It's always a Karen.
"""Oh, my God, Karen!"""
"Yo, I learned something."
"You want to go to a white people's party, say you know Karen."
They will take care of your ass the whole day.
"""You know Karen?"
"""Well, come on, sit down."
"Have a pumpkin spice latte."""
"Now, I'm gonna tell you why these bad things happen."
Rajinikanth took it?
Why would he take it?
How would I know sir?
May be he's starting a new party?
Oh God!
He has robbed me clean.
I earned that money by every mean I could in all these years of public life.
"I beg you, please tell me, where's my money?"
"I don't know anything sir, I'll fall at your feet sir."
Hey Officer!
"You took charge with a promise to catch him,"
"I lost crores of rupees, do something I say."
"No expression on face, do something I say."
"Thank God, he plucked few strands of hair only sir."
Wait my partner...wait...
I was expecting your call.
How are you?
Partner?
Who is your partner?
"You helped me in robbing, right?"
Actually I knew that Minister's money is with the peon.
"After I made you my partner in the plan and you caught him,"
"I came to know where's the money, it means I made you also my partner in the crime, right?"
"Want me to send your share of the booty, partner?"
I like you...
You're making a grave mistake by making me your partner.
You became my partner the day you shot a bullet into me.
If I had been your partner I would've shot the bullet into your heart.
Wantonly I shot 6.4 inches away from your heart.
"You're terrific, partner, but you don't know about me."
"Stealing isn't your profession, you're doing it for fun."
You like challenges.
Anyone will go bonkers or finished if he sees me...
"If I allow him to touch me, anyone would become my slave..."
"If I give little liberty on me, anyone will go mad..."
Anyone would die in the fire of my desire...
It's run into the wilderness...
It's fire of passion of fans...
This attack is fatal...
Nobody can stop this stealing of hearts...
"If you make a request, you'll enjoy the fun..."
"If you tease with romance, I'll take you to the bliss..."
It seems he's a latest thief.
"Without any discrimination, he's robbing every one."
The doors remain closed but the money inside vanishes.
That's the magic!
"Forget all this, I'm giving you full powers as the Home Minister."
Close down his file swiftly.
- First theft...
- July 5th.
It happened on 5th.
12 thefts in 10 months.
"According to you, it's Rs.75 crores."
Much more according to me.
He didn't spare anyone.
"Before robbing doctor, his name appeared on newspaper a day earlier."
Lawyer appeared on TV a day earlier before he was robbed.
He robbed Minister's home a day after he commented on the thief.
All his victims were news makers before getting robbed by him.
He's leaving clues to us and enjoying our inability.
He's not a regular thief.
Hey you!
Did you read the files already?
I read him well.
"Well, not to be impolite, but, you know, sometimes a gal will be kissin' around on, like, the area near your genitals, but not quite on your genitals."
Makes me ticklish and insecure.
"You know, not to be impolite, but sometimes a gal will do some kissin' on the ears, which makes me uncomfortable, because even though I clean my ears, sometimes a tater will just roll out of there unexpected."
(CHUCKLES)
I kind of likes both those things.
"Yeah, it's why you're called ""Squirrely Dan."""
"Yeah, reason fuckin' five million."
"Well, nots to be impolite, but..."
This gal suggested that maybe I should have some attentions paid
to my butts hole.
That ever...
Ever happen to you guys?
Did you ever have a gal suggest that you need some attentions paid
to your butts holes?
"I'll take that as a hard no, I guess?"
She put a couple of fingers up there and...
It turns out you got a...
An erogenous zone up there.
Found...
Found the hot button and...
"Gaves it a tickle and, uh..."
Yeah.
"Feels, uh..."
"It feels pretty good, you guys, okay?"
- Pop fly.
- I really liked it.
It felt...
Felt very natural.
Nice.
That's how you get the body in front of it.
- Get the body in front of it.
"- They call it ""milking the prostate."""
"Well, what..."
"Minor illnesses, minor infections..."
Completely minor things   that could be cured for tiny sums if one only had the will.
We've developed a sort of priority list...
You're an angry man.
That's good.
It gives you a lot of drive.
"The educational supplies we need include books, tables, chairs, beds   but what we need most urgently is medicine."
Eventually we'd like to...
"Yes, yes."
We'd like to take twice as many off the streets.
- Would you like one?
"- No, thanks."
We'd like to take in twice as many and vaccinate them   which could be done all for less than five kroner a day.
And we'd like to change our food program...
- Do they all sleep in the same room?
- We have 45 at the moment.
"We go to an area, and in two minutes, 40-50 kids gather, who we then feed."
"But after five minutes, there are 500 kids."
- I don't need to see more.
- The new kids...
It's an extremely impressive project you have established.
Very impressive.
I've looked at different ways I might be able to help.
Thank you very much.
"In all, I found five different projects."
Yours is one of the most interesting.
Thank you.
We're glad to hear it.
But may I ask you why?
Like I said...
It's a good project.
"Oh, Carl, it is, believe me."
"I want the UV with the triple foam protectorant, and the car nouveau waxed."
The good stuff.
You just don't even worry about it.
"Just sit back on that gurney, and, you know, suck from that mask, and relax."
"All right, then."
This is very comfortable here.
"Wearing a paper gown is a little off-putting, but, you know, I'll go with it."
"When we do the interior, we like to enhance it with an aroma."
Do you have a favorite aroma you'd like to pick?
We'd love to facilitate that.
You got Pina Colada?
"Nah, I'm afraid not, sir."
No Pina Colada.
"Okay, how about Strawberry Boobs?"
"Nah, we ain't got that, neither."
"What we do have is Athlete's Foot,"
"Bloated Beach Cod, and Stank Breath."
Go through the list again.
"Oh, here we go."
This is the first part of our patented three-step treatment.
That kinda looks like you're just sorta flinging dirt on it.
What it actually is is Dumpster Juice.
Which is a combination of rain water and garbage.
"Very acetic, very harsh on your paint job."
And why are we doing this again?
It's just a pre-coat.
"I mean, obviously we need to prep the outer coat for, you know, the cat urine."
"And, of course, the hammers."
What the frick are you doing?
"Hey, Carl, let's lay back down and relax, okay?"
Just allow the mystery gas to do its work.
You were really there to meet this traveler that veritas wanted to protect.
"I remember everything, dad."
those are the memories of a small boy in shock trying to cope with the trauma of a meteor shower.
A trauma brought on by my own father!
My life changed forever that day.
You sacrificed me for the traveler.
why?
"Who is it, dad?"
Who is it?
What if I told you now that you are you traveler?
You're right.
Your life truly changed that day.
I told you in the helicopter that you were destined for a great future.
"That's why I've been so hard on you, trained you so relentlessly."
"Think, lex."
Think.
You have survived mortal injuries so many times.
How else can you explain it?
Because I was trained never to accept defeat.
"When I get my hands on that box in zurich,"
I have a feeling all my questions will be answered.
I know how strong it is...
The attraction of the dark power.
But it will destroy you.
I can't let you go down that terrible path.
You must not open that box.
I can't open it...
Because I need a second key.
Give it to me.
I've swept every possible place you could have hidden it.
And I finally realized there's only person you would trust it with.
Yourself.
"But you said, that you will get from me and sale it with 5°/° commision oh God, i was talking about the design which you were about to show me."
Which design?
The red one.
That's car's photo.
Then why you are showing inside space from outside?
"That means you are not the Laxmi N., who was coming to get car?"
"No... so you thought, that i am other Laxmi Narayan."
"You did this to me, what have you done... if you are not that Laxmi Narayan, then where is he?"
"That would be him, but this is i am."
"Sir, your Son is here who?"
Your Father.
That not my dad.
He is yours...
"Sir, you are not his Father?"
"I am not even married, how could i have son?"
"And now i think, i wont marry ever."
"Sir, everyone has there own taste."
We have one more Laxmi Narayan in spare.
Let me show...
"Sir, i have told you there is one more Laxmi Narayan in this hotel."
"And now even Manager has confirm too, i you will let me go?"
"Sir... shut up, i am stuck here and you want to leave?"
Just listen to me... now what has done is done.
Now listen to me... you... now you have to but the car.
Its worth is 1000000/- you can give 900000/-.
900000/-?
Madam i look stupid from face but i am not.
Why i buy the car?
"You know, in 5 days if i didn't pay the bank installments."
"Then they will my showroom, and just because of that i... otherwise i am not that type of girl."
"I am also not that type of person, do i look like Khurana's?"
"I have the reputation too, you can ask anyone at Chandni Chok if my Son find out that in hotel in one room... with one girl... shame... shame..."

"And in two days, when the planets align, we must offer up the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages and reveal the treasure."
And that is why it is essential we find the--
The Torch.
"But if the cult took the Torch from the Ark, where did they put it?"
"Well, they probably hid it in the safest place they knew."
The caves of Exeter.
The cult made these paintings of Atlantis based on descriptions from the platinum book itself.
It must have been paradise.
Yes.
"Torch of Truth, I presume."
"Yes, that's right."
Yes.
It doesn't tell us much.
What does it look like?
"Well, nobody knows exactly."
"I mean, these are the only visual representations that I've seen."
"Well, how can we find the Torch if we don't know what it looks like?"
"Well, Solon says that it's the mirror of the world, reflecting the past, present, and future."
"Professor, you said the cult was driven out by the Romans."
"Yes, the ones that weren't killed uh, fled with the Ark."
But they thought Solon was coming back for the Torch someday.
"Yes, that's right."
"That's right, yes."
"Well, maybe they hid it where they figured only he could find it."
Maybe.
Is this the same writing that's on the Ark?
"Yes, yes, this is the, uh, riddle of Solon."
These streaks look like rust.
Iron ore.
The altar's magnetic.
Let's check it out.
Wow.
I got accepted to Florida University.
"You mean to tell me, that you got in without hacking into the computer system... and making it all happen like you usually do?"
"All by myself, just like a big boy."
I see you guys later.
Where are you going?
What's wrong man?
Time to celebrate!
Touchy subject.
"""What are we all doing tonight?"""
Katie.
"Katie, you work at Hybra Tech don't you?"
I bet you see all sorts of examples of these scientific processes.
"Actually, I work in the monitoring station in security."
Hybra Tech is a classic example of a company... whose goods and services constantly udelices... the scientific discovery processes.
"They create almost everything, from processed cheese to napalm."
A very unfortunate part in the scientific processes is failure.
"In simple terms, you can not make a omelette without breaking a few eggs"
Where are you going?
Get back to your seat please.
What is going on here?
Julian parents was 2 of the volunteers that died last year at Hybra Tech... they where in a car-wreck.
Julian!
wait.
She didn't know.
It's cool...
They been on my mind a lot lately.
It's been really hard on my brother too.
I am so sorry.
Thanks...
I'll be alright.
"Well, well, well..."
What have we here?
"- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe."
"It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham."
"I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too."
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee.
"That's what it is, Mitchell."
"What's Thuggee, sir?"
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed 50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
"There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year."
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
"The order was religious and worshipped Kali, the goddess of blood."
"The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?"
Stranglers.
They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
"Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately."
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
"- What do we do, sir?"
"- You're dismissed, Ballantine."
"MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger..."
"Ballantine, you're dismissed."
"You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work."
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
"Ballantine would be a great help, sir."
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
"Yes, sir."
He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
"However, I see you have no such doubts."
"I shall miss you, my dear boy."
But do not hurry back on my account.
Fear worked like yeast in my thoughts.
"And the fermentation brought to the surface in great gobs of scum, the images of disaster."
"A loaded gun, held carelessly at a stile... a horse rearing and rolling over... a shaded pool with a submerged stake a car at a blind corner."
All the catalogue of threats to civilised life rose and haunted me.
I even pictured a homicidal maniac mouthing in the shadows swinging a length of lead pipe.
"Tickets, please, sir."
"- Brideshead, sir?"
- Yes.
Lady Julia's waiting in the yard.
Thank you.
- You're Mr Ryder?
- Yes.
Jump in.
- How is he?
"- Oh, he's fine."
- Have you had dinner?
"- Yes, on the train."
"Well, I expect it was beastly."
There's some more at home.
Sebastian and I are alone so we thought we'd wait for you.
- But what happened to him?
- Didn't he say?
I expect he thought you wouldn't come if you knew.
He cracked a bone in his foot so tiny that it hasn't a name.
But they X-rayed it yesterday and told him to keep it up for a month.
"It's a great bore to him, putting out all his plans."
He's been making the most enormous fuss.
Everybody else has gone.
At first he tried to make me... stay back with him.
- Just stop.
"Nobody's doing this job, okay?"
Not even Uncle Eddie.
[alarm sounds] [radio announcer] ...
many consider Cezanne to be the bridge between Post-Impressionism and Cubism.
"In fact, both Matisse and Picasso called him ""the father of us all."""
He was a remarkable innovator...  [grunting]
Little-known fact:
Cezanne was rejected by the Paris Salon for 18 years.
"But he never gave up, until 1882, when they finally exhibited his 1866"
"""Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cezanne,"""
"the father of the artist, reading L'Évenement, his first and last successful submission."
"[Eddie] What the fuck you mean, it won't play?"
"I'm telling you, it won't play."
"It won't play, or you won't play with your brother?"
Ah!
Thought you guys were supposed to eat about it.
"Can you not yell, please?"
"What, do I gotta sit you two punks down again"
- and talk about family values?
"- Eddie,"
I cannot work with him.
And I will not work with that psycho girlfriend of his.
"- For Chrissake, she attacked Sonja."
- So what?
"A couple broads, they get handsy with each other and you wanna call the whole goddamn thing off with all that money just sittin' there waitin' for us."
Listen to me.
It's not.
"These people that you're tryin' to rob, they're not just some banditos from down South."
Okay?
They're degenerate killers.
"Yeah, well, they ain't never met Eddie Cruickshank."
"Come on, snap!"

"-Yes, I was."
"So wake up and I say, that is a school or am I dreaming?"
You're dreaming.
-Wonderful!
-Is it edible?
Do not miss those millions of tiny?
I do not have any condition create as many children.
-Just as a birthday present ...
neat and tidy.
"But I never knew, until now, who kept them that way: me""!"
"Yeah, the boys are certainly getting around these days."
I've had a V-mail letter just the other day from Norman Page.
-You remember Norman?
"-Oh, sure!"
He said something about...
He dug a foxhole so deep it was just short of desertion.
And then the seasons spun by so fast they've seen to become one.
The war news was too big to grasp and too unhappy to understand.
Selena wrote me often about Peyton Place.
and I treasured her letters.
She always tried to mention my mother... and tell me what people were saying to each other.
Orwere not saying.
"Eventually,I broke the ice of my intentions... and subscribed to the ""Peyton Place Times""."
"Iwas hungry for names that meant something to me... but among them,unhappily,came the names of those gone forever."
Betty...
Rodney asked me to take care of you.
-I don't need your help.
-But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years-old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought of anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but..."
"Rodney liked flashy girls, so that's the way I was going to be."
Funny thing is Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him.
But you taught him appearance was worth more than feelings.
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's...
Let's keep of what's left of the family together.
"No, a little brighter one, please."
"Nowhere at all, gunfighter."
You done killed yourself a set of perfectly good saddlebags that cost me eight Yankee dollars in gold.
And if you didn't kill my last pint of... of water between me and the angels.
Where did you ever learn to shoot?
"In a better school than you did, fortunately."
"I don't usually miss, friend."
"Neither do I, and I better straighten you out on one thing."
I am no friend of yours.
Here.
Just here.
"That'll be dry, too."
"Worth one, but it's gonna be dry, too."
I gotta admire you for finding them at all.
You must have some Apache blood in you.
"That Silmser, he was from my own part of west Texas."
I liked the man.
I'll bet you did.
I bet you cried when you staked him out on the ground.
Here.
"Well, Tyree..."
I just don't have the inclination or the breath to offer you the water a second time.
"Friend, I could say I don't want any."
"I could say that I don't want any because if I'd have shot straight,"
I wouldn't have these...
these chains on my wrist.
Or your company.
"Just my own pleasant solitude to die in, huh?"
I could say that.
"Or I could say that... that I don't want it, because I'm too proud to be given something that, in reality,"
I'm gonna take!
You have a bad disposition... and a big mouth.
"Like I told you, I am no friend of yours."
I have to get out of this as soon as possible.
My kids are still young...
They would be shocked if they knew their dad was suspected of murder.
"I just remembered, it's my oldest daughter's birthday today."
And it's just going to pass by like this.
Even though us meeting at Chung Gye Plan was an ill-fated relationship...
What was an ill-fated relationship?
We... got along like blood brothers.
We did?
- When?
"- Wow, seriously..."
"But I was thankful that you gave me 150,000 won more than the others..."
So I will repay you with this favor.
Hey...
Thanks.
"For us, as a life mentor and his apprentice..."
"We shared a lot with each other, don't you think?"
- When?
"- Oh, seriously..."
There will be moments when you suddenly remember these things...
I will go with Chan Gyu tomorrow morning.
We've been working together all along.
The remaining one percent that's crawling out...
I have that too.
"Anything I'm doing with Jung Yeon, I know I can do to the best of my ability."
What?
How should we understand this relationship?
What is there to understand?
We're friends.
"Well, more than friends..."
"I guess we should say, best friends?"
Aren't we all friends now?
I'll take care of it my Paşa.
Don't you worry
"But Sümbül Ağa, in silence.."
Right?
Mustafa go to your room.
It is late
We have things to discuss with your mother
"Mahidevran, I'm very pleased of how you raise Mustafa"
Your effort on raising him as a prince is great
"I'm doing my best, your Majesty"
I'll keep the honory of being graced by you all my life
About the things I want to discuss with you ...
I'm all ears your Majesty
"As a Haseki and mother of a prince, I am granting you a plenty of spending money to do charity anywhere in any way you want"
You make me happy your Majesty
Thanks to you I'll get countless of prayers
It is like you have given me the paradise
May God bless you
I'm going.
Have a good night
"What is it, Nasuh Efendi?"
You seem so troubled
It is nothing my Bey.
We are having fun
"Come on, welcome"
Is it that you are in love?
How can I fall in love My Bey?
I'd recognise a man in love even if I see him in the darkness
Obviously you have a heartache
"Diamond cut diamond, Nasuh Efendi"
Wine won't heal your wound
A human can heal
Just a minute.

That's right.
Like that.
Stop blowing now and drink it.
Do you really have nowhere to go?
Whether a house or dorm or a contact person or the cell phone number of someone you know?
A guardian or a friend or something like that...
Who am I talking to right now?
I should have just left.
I think that I've been caught right well and good.
I'll go and wash up so go change into this for now at least.
Hotel
What the...?
"Seriously, Hey!"
Turn on the light!
Give it.
Give it here!
"Are you, by any chance, being coy?"
Don't!
Don't do that!
Don't be coy!
My ideal type is an intellectual woman.
A complete opposite of you!
Don't look at me lubriciously like that.
"Just in case you misunderstand, I am telling you clearly."
"The reason I brought you here is because the day is almost over, it's raining, and your screw is a bit loose, so, ""I'll let her stay just for one night."" That was all!"
"So, ""Oh, my!"
"Is this man interested in me?"""
"""Should I use the opportunity to hook up with him somehow?"""
Let go of this kind of futile expectation or hope.
"Wake up from your dream, I tell you!"
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must have made a nice change for her.
She noshed me off for free so that tells you something.
"Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
"Problem is, isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?"
"Entrances, lobbies."
"Exit to runways, manager's office."
There's a blind spot in the toilets which could be a good thing.
It's the one thing everyone does before they get on a plane.
Didn't you say the front entrance was covered?
"Yeah, I can get you in a different way."
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course on my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"Spider, right?"
Not the nickname I heard.
Grantham Hill Private Airfield
We're done.
I'm gonna go and stay with my sister now.
I assume that we never meet again which is a tragedy I'll just have to learn to live with.
Here are the keys to the flat.
We're not finished yet.
"We had an agreement, Lenny."
"Yeah, but I think you overestimated your ability to insist on dealbreakers though."
You gave me an undertaking
To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"Send me back to prison, then, please."
We can do that.
It is feasible.
I know that wasp venom has a pheromone in it that signals other members of the hive to attack.
Of course one question still stands.
"If this is a pheromone, then how did it get into their bloodstreams?"
Are you kidding me?
People will try anything if they think it's going to get them high.
"Remember a few years ago, people were licking the backs of cane toads?"
Do I!
Awful things.
"So, this substance, it could ostensibly be attracting the insects."
"It is possible, but to be sure"
I need to be able to run some tests with a pure sample.
"All right, I'll get on it."
"Oh, hey, did you have any luck with that thing you were working on the other day?"
What thing?
"The Jane Doe, you and Mike."
"Yes, we were able to get an ID off her dental records."
You going to tell me or what?
Why wouldn't I tell you?
"It's, uh..."
Gabriel Claremont.
"Oh, okay."
The thing I'm not supposed to tell you is that this may have something to do with Henry Fitzroy.
"Oh, trust me."
"According to her agent, Miss Claremont had a photo shoot three days ago."
Nobody's heard from her since.
So the last person to see her would be the photographer.
I'm still working on that.
I did however find the address to the studio.
Do you want to go check it out?
- I'll get my coat.
- Okay.
Stop worrying.
She'II recover her mood pretty quick.
"still, what if she starts to say she won't go to Hawaii again?"
You know how stubborn she is.
I've got an idea.
"Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?"
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service... and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.
Why not?
You've still got some summer vacation left.
"And besides... if the circumstances require, there's a road open to the canning company, right?"
But I've got to get passports for Grandma and the children.
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.
Keeping Grandma in a good mood is our first priority.
"No, but I telephoned him last night."
Most extraordinary.
Are you quite certain that you haven't a gentleman named Edward McDermott stopping here?
- Absolutely.
- Then how could I have spoken to him?
"- It's beyond me, miss."
- I'm certain there's nothing to worry about.
Go up to your room and make yourself comfortable.
"And meanwhile, I'll scout around and see if I can find your Mr. McDermott."
- You must think this very stupid of me.
"- Not at all, not at all."
Your friend must surely be around here somewhere.
"I'll try and find him, and then give you a ring in your room."
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.
- Where's Manville?
"It was wrong, sir."
I did it without thinking.
"It got me in trouble, which I accept full responsibility for."
"It made trouble for the Navy, which I would fix if I could, but I can't."
And it got Fanny in terrible trouble.
Her life is at risk for wanting to be with me.
I'm sorry about all of it.
I really am.
How long has the cord been prolapsed?
"Since right before we called you, Dr. Chadway."
Foetal heart rate is falling again.
- She had an epidural?
- Two hours ago.
All right.
Prepare for a C-section.
- Bud!
- The head's too far down.
Get me a vacuum and call Neonatal for resuscitation at delivery.
"I'll take it from here, Dr. Chadway."
"- Where have you been, Dr. Gettis?"
- With another patient.
"Okay, Harriet, the next contraction, get ready to push."
Petty Officer Elling.
Would you and your counsel please stand?
You may announce the sentence.
"Petty Officer Third Class James Elling, in consideration of your plea of guilty to all charges and specifications and your declared remorse, this court-martial sentences you to be reduced to the rank of seaman and to forfeit $500 pay per month for three months."
"Members, thank you for your service."
This court-martial is adjourned.
- No brig time?
- No brig time.
"I gotta go see Fanny, sir."
"Yes, you do."
"You should see a doctor, Arthur."
Too much sand in the lungs.
That's the real curse of the pharaohs.
I'll be fine once we're away from Egypt.
I shall miss it dreadfully.
(Soldier shouting orders)
Monsieur Carter.
I am sorry that it has come to this.
I must ask you for the key to the tomb.
The refusal to work is in contravention of the terms of the concession.
My department will now take responsibility and overall control of the tomb and the excavation.
You mean you're kicking me out?
"I warned you, Monsieur Carter."
I've already spoken with the minister.
He's in full agreement with me.
"The key, if you please."
"The soldiers were hardly necessary, you know."
"Have I done the right thing, Arthur?"
You did what you believed to be right.
(Phone ringing)
Carter.
OPERATOR:
"Mr Carter, I have Monsieur Lacau for you from Cairo."
HOWARD:
The situation in Egypt has changed.
The nationalist campaign of violence has backfired.
The government are concerned.
The hotel trade is vital to them and they're worried about losing tourists.
Lacau is keen to reopen the tomb.
But he needs an international team to do it and he's asked me to go back.
"Under his proposal,"
I see that I remain responsible for the costs of the excavation.
Check the circuit breaker.
Nobody move!
Everyone here's a suspect.
Put on another pot of coffee.
It's gonna be a long night.
"Four turds, five suspects, so many, many nameless victims."
The first poop was obviously Frank.
"Old and weak, he had an accident, that's why he was so intent on destroying it."
"There were many turds before this one, weren't there, Frank?"
"This was just the first time you got caught, wasn't it?"
And then you went and did it again the next night?
Or did you?
Two poops in two nights?
Tall order for such a short man.
No.
The second poop belonged to Charles.
"He wanted to get back at Frank, but due to his poor diet, couldn't produce a turd."
"So he called Mac, who jumped at the chance to see"
Frank humiliated one more time.
But Charlie overlooked the fact that Dennis listens to Mac's phone calls and he heard every word.
Dennis was jealous that Charlie had chosen Mac to help instead of him.
He swore to have his revenge.
That's why encouraged Mac to sleep while he stayed up.
He was going to put the frame on Mac by pooping next to him.
But he didn't realize that a futon slept on by the weight of three men would be off its axis and slope to the center.
And like a small brown snail... it crept to the middle between Charlie and Frank.
Deandra!
You wanted in on this poop war from the start.
"No, I didn't."
The outcast?
The slut?
The bitch.
"You got frostbite, avalanches, and deadly icicles."
Icicles aren't deadly.
They're refreshing and delicious.
They're knives that can fall from the sky at any moment.
Sky knives!
- They kill a billion people a year.
- That seems high.
"Dad, come on."
It's snow day.
Can't we at least go outside and build one tiny awesome snow fortress?
Absolutely not!
You shovel that walkway before it turns into ice.
"And no forts, I mean it!"
"Naturally, we did the opposite 'cause forts are awesome!"
"Good job, dude."
"I can't feel my fingers, but this definitely was two hours well spent."
Do you think maybe we should shovel the walkway a little so Dad doesn't totally freak?
"Yeah, we should..."
after a quick expansion.
Quick's good.
Whatcha thinking?
"I'm picturing a master bedroom with an attached bath, butler's quarters, a dojo, one of those maze gardens, all of the rooms from ""Clue,"""
an indoor basketball court.
A basketball court inside a snow fort?
That's just the first floor.
The second level's where the party's at.
"Hot tub, sauna, fire pit."
You don't think that'll create an awful lot of heat?
Yeah...
- once the word gets out.
- Son of a bitch.
A fort?
Alex will bring your luggage
Their is no phone network on this island
How can I contact others?
Via Satellite.
Kabir Malhotra has satellite phone
is Mr. Kabir Malhotra lives here?
is this island belong to him?
Mr. Malhotra has bought this island
And he took the responsibilty for all villagers
Malessa will bring you to your rooms
I have waited for 3 years for this moment
Its priceless
Only flower of the world whose flower grows after 8 years
You are a pimp
You are a murderer
He is saying rubbish
It was just a trailer
Movie will start now
This story begun 20 years ago
There was a baby.
Very innocent
Why you are telling this to us?
I was saying she became orphan by the age of 6
For rs 2000 she was sold to orphan house of Thailand
It was your orphan house
We never buy childrens.
We take them for care
A 6 year old girl was sent to Thailand
She was sent to a world which is worst than a nightmare
Only her body was left.
She became prostitute
"As much as money she earns, her owner gets more profit"
"Spencer, if you don't wanna admit what you're doing, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
"Bossman, I'm not afraid to talk about anything."
I just thought that that kind of transparency between you and I would put you in an awkward position with the league.
Let me worry about what position I'm in.
"Fine, it's true."
I'm guilty of sniffing in the tall weeds.
With a short snout.
I wanna bring a team to Vegas.
"Reaching for the brass ring, huh?"
"Well, admittedly, it's a little outside of my expertise, but, yes."
"I always knew you had big balls, Spencer, but I didn't know your judgment was this questionable."
How do you figure?
The league's just approved you and you're already biting its hand?
Didn't even call for approval?
That's just plain wrong.
The upside's worth it.
I suppose we'll see.
"The way I see it, there's only one way to take a team to Vegas, and that's big, even by Texas standards."
That's the only way we do it.
"Big takes vision, Spencer."
Do you have a vision?
I do.
"But even if I didn't, Wayne Hastings does."
"- Wayne Hastings, huh?"
- Yeah.
"Well, that boy there's a proven visionary."
He's like the me of Vegas.
"- Oh, you're more handsome."
- I could use your support and definitely your wisdom to get this whole thing done.
"Yeah, approval comes through Texas."
Everybody knows that.
And how far in is Wayne?
Let's see another example.
"Now, be careful here with this power of two."
We can not apply that to each of these two terms.
"What this means is (3y-5), (3y-5)."
"So again, we can FOlL."
"This is equal to the product of the first terms in the binomials, so 3y * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 3y * -five."
"And then plus the product of the inner terms in the two binomials, so -five * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the last term in the two binomials, so -five * -five which is equal to 9y^2 - 15y - 15y + 25."
And combining the outer and inner terms gives us our answer of 9y^2 - 30y + 25.
"Now again, this is a common type of multiplication here where we're multiplying a binomial by itself."
And there's a special formula again in this type of case.
And the formula is that (A-B)^2 = A^2 - 2AB + B^2.
"That is the outer and inner terms are the same, so there'll be two of them."
"Which we just saw with A = 3y, and B = five."
"So, our answer here is A^2 or (3y)^2 - two * A * B, and then plus B^2, or 9y^2 - 30y + 25."
And this is how we multiply two binomials.
"Thank you, and we'll see you next time."
"Now we're going to succinctly talk about body fluid cleanup, from a potential bio-hazard."
"Now, when we do this, I'll tell you, one of the best things you can do actually, is have your scene set up first."
"I mean making sure you have extra pair of gloves already laid out, having your disposable wipes, having your premixed 1 to 10 household bleach solution,"
"One part bleach to ten parts water, which is suggested by the Centers for Disease Control for a disinfecting household solution, if you don't have a commercial virucidal, or another disinfecting solution."
"The goal here, now, is to obviously disinfect the surface, this could be applied to tools or other inanimate objects as well, but in this case it's a table top."
"Somebody had a bloody nose, a child or an adult, they bled on the table, and now we're coming in later to disinfect this."
"In the meantime, if you notice there's a blood-spill, and you can't disinfect right away, block off the area so that other people don't come in contact with it, and become infected as well, or at least exposed."
So first is to actually clean up as much of the gross contaminate as possible.
We're gonna do this by wiping the bulk of the contaminate off the table.
"If you can have someone assist you by bringing the bag in, we're going to dispose of the contaminate in a bio-haz bag, being careful not to cross-contaminate."
"Now, if we're working with a clean bottle, and we've just wiped up contaminate,"
I mean I can get this contamination on these gloves pretty easily.
"Let's remove the first contaminated gloves without snapping or popping the gloves, with a glove-on-glove, skin-on-skin, removal procedure."
"Now we're gonna be careful, and actually drop those into the bio-haz bag as well."
Shall I buy eggs?
- Eggs?
Buy the whole shop.
Buy all things you need at home.
- Take colour for Holi.
Take whatever you like.
- Buy coffee for your husband.
Buy Safi to purify his blood.
The Urban Design master studies (prototypically) fulfills and complies with the promise of interdisciplinary
After studying urban planning and architecture it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg it was for me absolutely clear that I would choose to study Urban Design here in Hamburg
One of them was... or is... the theoretical background that is applied in our practical work.... that they are really used... also the existent interdisciplinary work that practically occurs with an open source way of thinking that one wouldn't find in any other university.
"What makes this master program for me really very special is ... that we don't only work with students but we also work with the professors, we don't learn something with an top-down approach but we actually are on their same level and we can to a certain point shape the whole master program."
Hello!
My name is Sarah.
I come from Cairo.
I learned German last year because I wanted to study UD in HCU.
Mainly because for me as an architect it was a super chance to work with sociologists and ethnologists together.
And in reality I was never disappointed from such a decision.
My name is Tabea and I worked for the last 5 years as a landscape architect in Switzerland.
"I decided to study Urban Design here in Hamburg since it was important for me to develop my own methods, techniques and tools that could later get incorporated in my professional life."
"What we have been learning here has been also causing a wave of interest to the extent that we have been invited to take part in international workshops, give lectures and to write articles."
Our theme is recycling systems in Hamburg.
We are trying to understand the city as a resource.
As a resource for materials for example.
Materials that today would most probably enter a degradable procedure rather than a revaluation or reassessment procedure.
Our goal is to use those materials to give them value and through that creating new conceptions.
"To be able to work on such a project we were supported by the professors, the economists, the architects, and the sociologists in HCU."
"Even beyond HCU we have asked other experts about topics such as REcycling, waste and UPcycling."
The lamellas are coming straight from a garbage container.
The garbage container is standing right beside my apartment building.
And all the time... when I walk pass it...
"I come by new items thrown by people, and when something interesting appears I would take it with me and in this case it was the lamellas, and this is now the 5th lamp that we've brought together."
"That is, this is going to be cut off point for A. This would be."
"B, and then this for, C, and, then, right here, for, D, and here for E. we can ask how much is, how much is A gonna incur in pollution abatement to clean up these first four units, cuz it's not, it's gonna buy one right, so that's 100 plus."
"200, 600, so that's three, six, $1500."
I hope I have that right.
"Let's try again, 300, yes, 1500."
"B is going to clean up these first two units, which is going to be equal to $800."
"And C is going to include all of these which is $600, $1200, that is $3000, that C is going to incur in clean up costs."
D is going to clean up the first three which is $3000 again.
"And E is when clean up only one unit or incur cost equal to $1,000.00."
Each of these firms is going to incur from setting standards and selling rights.
And A incurred $700 as we indicated earlier. with setting a standard.
"If we add this total up we're going to come up with $13,500 in total costs."
Now if we sell rights.
"These five figures here are going to total 9,300."
"It is actually cheaper to, to, to achieve the, pollution goal through the auctioning of rights and by setting standards."
"And the reason is that the people who buy the rights are, are going to be the high-cost polluters."
The people who are gonna be forced out of buying those rights are going to be the low-cost producers of pollution abatement.
"As a result, what we're going to do is achieve environmental. quality improvement by a la-, by encouraging the low-cost pollution abaters to do the pollution abatement."
"Now, the interesting issue is this, who would favor which."
"The method, the standard or the selling of rights."
"Well firm A incurs a cost of $700 here, $1.500 in selling rights issue."
You can imagine that even without considering the cost of the one ticket that firm A buys that firm
A. Will vote for the standard.
"And it's total cost over here is going to be $3,000, because 1,500 in abatement costs plus 1,500 for the standard."
"Firm B, well, it looks like the standard is, is going to be more costly than the pollution right."
"But notice that Firm B has to buy three pollution rights, that's 4,500 or 5,300, so B is going to favor the setting of the standards."
"C Well, right off the bat, this is going to be cheaper for Firm C. D has equal costs inclusion and in both cases, but C/D is going to have to buy two pollution rights which makesthis total over here $6000."
So we get D voting for the setting of the standards and firm E
"looks like it's a clear winner for the selling of freights, but notice that firm"
"E is gonna have to pay 1500 for each of four pollution rights, which means it's total cost of the year is gonna be 7000 dollars, which means that firm D. Is going to, is going to be a winner and in fact it will get the unanimous vote."
"What's really very interesting is that the selling of, of pollution rights is actually less costly in terms of resource use."
But the politics of pollution abatement favor the setting of the standard.
"And it's the expected value of e, to the s transpose x."
"Okay, and this is equal to e to the s, transpose mu, plus a half s transpose sigma s."
"Now, you're probably familiar with this in the 1 dimensional case, we'll just recover here."
"Suppose x is really just a scale of random variable, then the moment generating function of x is equal to the expected value of e to the sx, and it's equal to e to the s mu plus the half sigma squared s squared."
And this is the case where x is normal with mean mu and variance sigma squared.
So this is the moment generating function of the scalar.
Normal random variable.
"This is, it's generalization to a multivariate normal random vector, x."
Okay.
"So, we call our partition we saw in an earlier module."
We can break x into two blocks of vectors x1 and x2 as such.
"We can extend this notation, notation naturally."
"So we can write Mu equals 1 2, and equals to This sigma 11, sigma 12, sigma 21, sigma 22 and they are the mean vector and covariance matrix of x1, x2."
So we have the following results on the marginal conditional distributions of x.
The marginal distribution of a multivariate normal random variable is itself normal.
In particular the marginal.
Distribution of Xi is multivariate normal with mean vector Ui and variance covariance matrix sigma Ii.
"So for example X1 is multivariate normal, in fact it's k components, mu 1, sigman 1, 1."
And similarly X2 is multivariate normal.
"Mu 2, sigma 2, 2, and this is n minus k components."
"And we have here an example of the bi-variance normal density function, where the correlation beween x1 and x2 is 80%."
If we rotate the service you can see the correlation of 80 percent the large values of X 1 are associated with values of x 2
like all values of x 1 are related to all values of x 2.
So we can also talk about the conditional distribution assuming sigma is positive definite.
The conditional distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is also multivariate normal.
"In particular x 2, given that x 1 equals little x 1 is multivariate normal with mean vector mu 2.1."
"In the variance, covariance matrix, sigma 2.1."
"Where mu 2 1, is given to us by this expression here, and sigma 2.1 is given to us by this expression here."
"And we can get some intuition for this result, by just imaging the following situation; so we've got X one down here."
"We have X two over here, and imagine we plot some points from X one and X two if you like, we generate X one and X two from some distribution, from the bivariate normal distribution, in particular."
"So the mean of X one is, let's say mew one and the mean of X two is mew two."
Okay.
I'm not able to trace that reference.
Alright.
"So I said, well, well good."
"They gave two references, so I have hope here."
So I went to reference fourteen.
"Pulled up, the paper."
It was a paper.
"Scanned through the paper, did a search on the paper."
"It did not contain the words the ambient sunlight, the word mountain, or the word"
"UVC and I didn't do UVC lighting, I just did UVC."
So there was no mention of any of those things in that paper.
"So, it was a reference to nowhere, because what the authors were giving me as their backup for that statement, it just didn't exist at least not in those references."
"So I wasn't able to ever get that information, cuz it wasn't at least where the authors told me it was."
"So that's an example of references nowhere and again, I think this happens a lot."
"So, you know, if you can avoid it in your own writing, hopefully, by doing a good prewriting step, by carefully organizing your information before you start, and keeping your, you know, that information with the references early on you won't make these kinds of mistakes where you just have references that don't actually back up what you're saying."
"And then finally, the citation propagation concept like telephone I was, I was saying before."
This was one of my pet peeves and so I just want to point out an example of this and caution you to avoid citing secondary sources.
"So, when I was a graduate student, I worked on, something called female athlete triad."
"And one of the components of that triad was something we called disordered eating, which itself is kind of poorly defined, but in any case, a part of the triad is disordered eating."
"So people would always want to say, well, how common is disordered eating in female athletes?"
"And at the time that I was a graduate student and writing out papers on this,"
"In the late 90's or early 2000's, there was Hallmark statistic that everybody cited."
"It's, the statistic was that fifteen to 62% have disordered eating."
And that was just in every paper on female athletes triad eating disorders in athletes.
That's just the one that everybody gave.
"However, it wasn't like they all cited the same source."
"If you, I was trying to trace back at one point where that statistic came from and I found about 50 different attributions for where that statistic came from."
"So one paper would cite Smith et al., another paper would cite Jones et al and they all cited different things."
Well obviously that statistic came from somewhere.
"So, everybody's citing secondary sources."
"So, I want to give you some examples."
"So, this was from a paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine."
That adding to the back of the queue is easy.
"We saw how we did that with the stack, right, so that the End queue operation doesn't need that tail pointer and it already kind of wasn't a problem for us."
"Now, the D queue operation would mean, okay, using our tail pointer to know where the"
last close value is tells us it's ten.
"But we have the same problem I had pointed out with the stack, which is, we can get to this value, we can return this value, you know, we can delete this cell, but what we need to do, also, in the operation, update our tail pointer so a subsequent D queue can do its work efficiently."
"And it's that backing up of the tail pointer that is the sticky point that given that ten doesn't know who points into it, the single link list if very asymmetric that way."
"But you only know what's follows you, not what proceeds, but backing up this pointer is not easy."
"It involves the reversal of going back to the beginning, walking your way down to find somebody who points to the last [inaudible]."
So it seems like this tail pointer didn't buy us a lot.
"It helped a little bit, you know, to get some of the operation up and running, but in the end, keeping and maintaining that tail pointer sort of came back to bite us."
"In the case of the Strategy A, the tail pointer gives us immediate access to the back, which we're going to need for the end queue."
"If I go to end queue of 40, in this case, then what I'm going to need to do is make a new cell, attach it off of the current cell, and then update the tail, right, to point to that cell while that update's moving forward down the list, right."
"If you're on the third cell and you add a fourth cell, you need to move the tail from the third to the fourth."
Moving that direction's easy.
It's the backing up where we got into trouble.
"So in fact, this suggests that Strategy A is the one we can make both these operations manipulate in constant time in a way that this one got us into trouble."
I think we can do it.
Let's switch it over.
I've got an empty queue here.
"Also, it is empty in size."
"This is the same problem with size, which is either you have to go count them or you have to cache the size."
"I will build the same exactly structure, in fact."
"Now, I'll type next."
It's going to have both a head and a tail pointer so we can keep track of the two ends we've got going.
I think I'm missing my [inaudible].
Slip over.
Okay.
"And then I will make the same comment here about, yeah, you need to delete all cells."
So I set the head and the tail to null.
"I'm now in my empty state that tells me I've got nothing in the queue, nothing at all, so far."
And my Y is empty.
Oh.
"So somebody, you know, Jones et al, Smith et al does the original study, They come up with a number of figure or statistic."
Jones et al cites Smith et al.
"Okay, now Beery et al goes to give the statistic in their paper."
"Well, they found that statistic in Jones et al,"
"They read it there, so they don't bother to go back to Smith et al and get the original reference, they just reference Jones et al."
"Okay, well then what happens, well."
"James et al now wants to say Beery et, you know, it reads the statistic and Beery et al, Now, they say Beery et al."
"So, now this citation, this statistic has gone through multiple, it's been propagated across the literature."
"And it reminds me of the game telephone, that children play."
"So, if you're not familiar with that game, that's the game where the children sit in a circle."
And the first person who comes up with a sentence.
And they whisper that sentence in the ear of the next child.
"And then, that child whispers into the ear of the next child, and so on and so forth until you go around the circle."
You get to the last child.
"And that child said, says out loud what they heard."
And it's always something that's very garbled and funny that has little resemblance to what started the statement that started the whole game.
And this is just what happens in the scientific literature when you propagate citations.
"You get, you lose important pieces of information from the original source down, down the chain."
"And so be, pay attention to that."
I'm going to talk a little bit more about that give you an example in a minute.
"And then, sometimes others just miss number references."
A way to avoid this is if you have available to you a reference management program like EndNote.
It's highly recommended that you use that cuz that can avoid these kind of mistakes.
But I'll give you an example of a paper I was working on a few years ago.
There were multiple authors in the paper.
We were not using a reference manager since there were multiple authors across different institutions looking at the paper.
"There was, and the writing had some problems in it, so a number of authors rewrote the paper, did some heavy editing on the paper."
"And in that process, a few of the references, the reference numbers got garbled."
"So, reference what we were calling reference three on draft one, you know, became reference five on draft two and nobody made the correct change."
"So, when that paper went out for a review with misnumbered references, because all sorts of confusion among the, one of, in particular, one of the reviewers, in terms of they were confused."
"And I initially thought that the reviewer just didn't know the literature, but actually when I looked carefully, I finally realized that the reason that the reviewer's confused because our number references are misnumbered."
"And so luckily we've caught it but it can happen pretty easily, especially if you're not using an automatic reference management program."
"Now, there is no formula about where to put any of these sliders, but in general, you want the radius slider to be less than 2.0."
"In this case, I'm going to drag it over to the"
"left until I see a lot of that glow disappear, and I'm gonna take it down pretty far, maybe 2.6."
And then I'm gonna go back up to the Amount Slider.
And I'll move that back over to the left until I just like the amount of sharpening.
And as
"I said, there is no perfect number and it's different on every image."
This is really a subjective decision.
"But you do wanna be careful not to over sharpen at this capture stage because as I said, later you will be sharpening again when you output a copy of this photo."
In this case I'm gonna bring that all the way down to around 50.
"There are two more sliders here, the Detail slider and the Mask slider."
The Detail slider determines which edges are being sharpened.
If I drag the
"Detail slider to the right, more edges get sharpened."
"And if I drag it to the left, fewer edges get sharpened, Now that's a little bit difficult to see, so, I wanna show you a kind of a map of which edges are being sharpened here as I drag the"
"Detail slider and I can do that by holding down the Option key on the Mac or the Alt key on a PC, and dragging that detail slider over to the right, and now you can see what's being sharpened."
"If I go in the other direction, you can see that fewer details are being sharpened."
So I'm gonna release the option or Alt key to go back and view the image and I'm just going to drag the detail slider to taste until the sharpening looks right to me.
"Now by dragging the Detail slider over to the right I've manage to sharpen lots of fine details including some that I really don't want to sharpen, here in the background in the hills and a little bit in the sky as well."
And in that case I can use the Masking slider to protect areas that really aren't edges from sharpening.
"Again, I'm going to hold down the Option key or the Alt key in the PC as I drag the Masking slider to the right."
And this is showing which parts of the image are being sharpened- the white parts.
And as I drag the Masking slider over to the right.
The parts that are turning black are being protected from sharpening.
"So, I'm protecting the sky and some of those hills in the background as well."
I'll release the Option or Alt key so I can see my image again.
And then I can tweak that masking slider while I'm
"looking at the image, maybe I'll drag it back a little bit."
"As I said, there really are no formulas."
"But in general, if I'm working on a scenic image like this, an image with a lot of fine detail, I will increase the Detail slider quite a bit and"
I may not have any masking.
"If I do, it will be fairly low."
"But if you use a design that other people have tried and you can just get some recommendations, it tends to work better and have less problems."
"So now, we have the don'ts."
"The first don't is, they're very common error, don't store Greywater."
"If you store it, it has nutrients in it, it has, you know, little pieces of gunk and stuff, it will start to break down and it'll basically start to smell very bad."
So you don't ever want to have it in a container and store it for later.
"You also use--make Greywater everyday, so there's no reason, practical reason to store it."
"You don't want to have a filter that you have to actually manually clean because that's just a point of failure, people forget to clean things if you need to have regular maintenance, so that's a not a good idea."
You don't want to use it if you're near a creek or a river.
It has nutrients in it and those nutrients can actually pollute.
It's like a fertilizer.
"So if that gets into the water, it will cause algae to grow and rob the creek or river of oxygen."
So some sites are just not appropriate for Greywater.
And you also don't want to use it if you don't have very good drainage on your site because you never want to have pooling of Greywater or running off.
You need to make sure it can soak properly into the ground to irrigate plants.
And so the next thing: mulch basin.
Who's heard of a mulch basin?
Got one person?
"Yeah, this is kind of a common-ish landscaping technique to be water-conserving."
"It's making, putting mulch around trees."
It lets--so what you do with the mulch basin is you go to the drip line of the tree and you remove some soil kind of like a doughnut ring of soil removed and you fill it up with woodchips instead.
"And this allows--with Greywater when you are going to irrigate with Greywater, it goes into that mulch basin."
It can spread out through all those woodchips.
It gets actually kind of filtered in the woodchips naturally and it soaks down into the ground and you never see it into some pool or run off.
It's just going underground and irrigating.
So it's probably the most important piece of a Greywater
System.
"And it's not often spoken of because it's, you know, out in the landscape."
It's not a pipe; it's not a plumbing part; it's something you do to your landscape.
But it's really important to have a well-functioning Greywater System.
"And so, as that Greywater goes into the landscape, the other really critical thing is something that you don't really see."
It's the billions of microscopic soil bacteria that are in the soil.
"They're consuming nutrients; they're taking any kind of gunky, dirty whatever is in your Greywater and turning it into plant nutrients."
(Jon K. Salunga) I will read a little something for all of us here.
"I wanted to read that and have some other notes too, but I'll be talking instead."
"Dear beloved educators,  I am writing just to say I see you."
"I see you and recognise the fullness  of your life of service, your expertise, your care and hard work, your wakefulness,  your sacrifice, your great offerings found day in  and day out of your classroom, in your lecture halls,  in your offices."
"I see you here,  I see you breathing in and out, connecting with the source of innate wisdom and peace, and power of inner source called mindfulness, our inner curriculum."
"I see you breathing in and out  to give birth to the change, to be the teachers you wish  to see in the world,"
I see you here.
"Breathing in, I am aware  of the daily acts of compassion you contribute in the world through your classroom."
"All the seen and unseen things that you hold, you endure, you balance, you tolerate,  you skillfully negotiate, to keep open the paths of possibility, promise and potential for all our youth."
"Breathing in, I bow deeply  to your immeasurable generosity, fortitude and creativity."
"I see you, I know you are here, and I am happy."
"May we be fully present to engage the collective shift and transformation taking place during this time, this right time on our planet and may we courageously  and creatively participate in bringing the heart back  to the art of teaching."
"May we breathe this new life in ourselves and our work, in the most creative, affirmative, expressive or subtle of ways in countless places for the benefit of our students,  our communities and the planet."
"I offer a lotus to you,  the Bodhisattva Educator in you."
Thank you for being here.
"I work at a high school in San Diego,"
I just want to share my experience  of practicing and bringing in the mindfulness practice more to myself and my work.
"Not necessarily to share with the students, but bringing the field of my own work into my scope of view from mindfulness."
"So, I am going to share something that  I learn from that, maybe might be helpful."
"I am working, in what we call an inner city school, with 95% of the students of color,  African-American students,Latino students,"
"Filipinos, South-East Asian,  Somalian students."
I am just sharing that because that is the context from where I teach.
That is my cushion.
(Laughter)
And I am just sharing today - I have 10 years of teaching so I know there is a lot of other  experienced educators here.
It is just to share my process  and to enter into a dialog.
I guess I use a little of teacher-talk.
"I'll start with an essential question, that's kind of thing that  we say in our role, right?"
"So, what shows up  when I bring my work life into the field of view of my mindfulness practice?"
"And actually one of the things  that I have been experiencing is that actually there is a lot  of unlearning like I am doing, a lot of the habit energy that are part  of school, part of our work."
I am unlearning that.
"The way that we are unlearning maybe, our relationship to eating very fast."
Faraday
T. Townsend Brown and others
Have had technologies that would liberate the world from the slavery of our current
Macroeconomic system.
We were impressed when we came upon Dr. Greer and his brilliant team.
They'd been working on groundbreaking ideas over the past decade and pushing a truth that not many people either know about or are scared to discuss.
So we thought to ourselves
This is a right topic to  document and expose in a film.
After contacting Dr. Greer we found out he had bigger and better plans.
This is a film that is the culmination of 22 years of research and discovery and journey in Space and time and consciousness  and it's going to be the most significant release of information on the UFO subject and new Energy that has ever occured.
The documentary film is just the tip of the iceberg but it's a crucial step toward moving forward in finding new technology and lifting the veil of secrecy blinding the masses.
There's a lot of talk about 2012
Well this is the year for this to happen.
But it isn't about the end of the world
It's about the end of an old and corrupt order in the world
And the beginning of an entirely new civilization on Earth and that civilization on earth will be one that has free energy abundance social justice and Interplanetary capabilities.
We need all of your support
The main corporate media will not cover this story
"Not even place it at NPR, PBS or BBC."
This is why we the people are going to make this film
The internet is our home.
"Each person is going to co-produce this with us, it'll be funded by all of us together"
It'll be distributed by all of us together.
"We want to have a thousand screenings, events and premiers"
But this is an undertaking that requires a large group of people.
So please spread the word
I hope you will help us
I hope you will join us
I hope you will network this information of this campaign to raise the funds for this film to everyone on your email list every organization you know
Because the time frankly is short.
Everyone on earth knows that we cannot live with  7 billion people burning oil and gas and coal.
Most of the public know that we are not alone and that the UFOs are real more than half the public know this.
"Literally within the browser, we can have more things going on to benefit you because it's a more powerful platform than any other browser; and I could assess that technically, but the important thing is it really is a much more powerful platform for this new augmented humanity model."
"At the same time, I've not talked about monetization and ads and so forth because I wanted to talk about end-users first."
It's also important that the people in these ecosystems make money.
So an example would be that people have thing--information that they want to sell.
They have advertising they want to show.
"There are many, many examples of this, and we take this very seriously, so obviously our revenue is among other things."
YouTube is a very interesting example of this.
YouTube--and everybody here is using YouTube--YouTube is this amazing global phenomenon now.
It has more than two billion of views per day.
Think about that.
Two billion views of YouTube everyday.
"I mean, think about the amount of time being spent doing this."
"A hundred and sixty million mobile views per day, 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, right?"
You can imagine the quality.
I'll leave that up to you.
"The business is doing very, very well with more than two billion monetized views per week and the number of advertisers, the number of monetized views is up 50% in the"
last year.
"Partners are doing well, our display business, another component of this."
We have more than 300 million visitors per day.
"We have more than--we--the DoubleClick platform, which we acquired awhile ago, serves over 45 billion ads per day, and 94 of the top 100 Ad Age advertisers advertise on the Google display network."
"So, what I wanted to do in a, in a sort of to start was to lay a framework, a model for you of what things are like now."
And what I felt would be fun would be to have some demos of products that are just about to get released and I hope will work in our demo.
The person in-charge of our mobile effort is Hugo Barra.
You want to come on up?
Why don't you get started?
And let's see--let's see what Hugo has for us. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Thanks very much, Eric."
Hello everyone.
My name is Hugo Barra and I'm part of the mobile product team at Google.
"Well, Eric was talking to you about the super computer in your pocket which, of course, is your mobile phone and what I wanted to do is actually show you a few specific examples of what exactly we mean by mobile super computing."
One of the most exciting and challenging technologies that we've been working at Google for many years is speech recognition.
"Two years ago, we launched the first version of our voice search application which I bet many of you here in the room use everyday to search the web."
"Arley, maybe set the stage with your own take on the budget."
The big picture.
"Where do you see this going in terms of a negotiation for Grand Bargain, the likelihood of that happening, the politics in the"
House especially?
"And then set the stage, if you will, for the challenges that CSBG is going to face which are going to be very, very big for FY ""14."
Arley:
I'll probably speak briefly about CSBG and then have the CSBG presentation and then speak a little bit more to that.
"In terms of the budget, and the key word is politics, the President is doing his best at this present time to try and get a Grand Bargain."
And the Grand Bargain was that he was trying to negotiate with the help of John Boehner last year prior to everything concerning sequestration.
There appear to be enough votes and some republican and democrat support in the House on what we would call a grand Bargain.
"And, of course, the issue there is whether you raise taxes a little bit more or whether you cut spending."
And what's been proven by the sequester is you cannot tax your way to prosperity and you cannot spend your way to prosperity either.
It's obvious the draconian cuts hinder and stifle the economy.
"And to cause money to grow in the economy, you've got to spend money."
After
"WWII and with the depression, FDR did it during the depression by spending money."
"When no one has money, when there's a low ebb and flow of money in the country, the government prints more money."
The government makes more money and the government puts people to work.
That's the reason why the President is concentrated on the stimulus programs.
"You hear him talking about the infrastructure, talking about roads and bridges, also talking about high speed rail and those types of things."
That's what the administration wants to do.
You have to juxtapose that against what some of the right wing of the
Republican Party want to do.
They want to cut everything.
You can't cut everything.
You've got to spend money in order to generate jobs.
In order to have jobs you've got to put some money into the industry and into different areas of the economy.
One good sign that's going on is it appears that the housing market is rebounding.
"As the housing market goes so goes construction, so goes long-term jobs."
The housing market is a good indicator that the economy is turning around.
"In terms of the unemployment rate, it is steadily coming down."
Even though there weren't that many jobs created in the last month overall the trend is still good.
Present value for an annuity.
"And remember, annuities, the amount of the annuity when you write could be called C. But when you go to a calculator or a spreadsheet we will call it PMT because that's what it, they call it, right?"
Makes sense.
Okay.
"I would like you to stare at this problem and I know you have the ability to pause and so on, but I'd like to pause with you and what I'm going to do, for every example, and if"
"I don't, you should do this, is I'm going to read out the problem for you and we'll talk about it a little bit."
"And then I would really encourage you to try to do the problem, I'll do it with you but I would encourage you to kind of think actively and be participating in it because I can't, you know, I can't see whether you're doing it or not but I hope you do."
"Okay, so what will be the value of your portfolio?"
What is the portfolio?
"Portfolio and, that's a lingo in Finance."
"Portfolio means whatever your investment is, wherever you have put your money."
"So, the word portfolio is used generically because you'll, you'll, you'll see later, it's a hangover from the fact that life has risk."
"And if life has risk and you do not like risk, which most people don't, you tend to not put all your eggs in one basket."
"So, the fact that you hold a basket of different things is called a portfolio."
"Okay, I'm."
"I try to emphasize words which are I take for granted because, you know, I mean, if you're new to Finance, which most of you probably are, you need to understand why certain language is used in, in very commonly."
"At retirement, if you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund."
"Now, if you are really young, say, you are fifteen and taking this class which I hope some of you are, don't worry too much about retirement, you know, have some fun."
"You're in high school, you haven't even be gun earning hopefully, just having fun."
"So, but this is something that you will do at some point, most people do."
"So, what I would recommend is just think of it as an intellectual problem but actually it's a very rare problem."
"So, what will be the value pf your portfolio over time and you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund?"
What is a pension fund?
"Pension fund is a place or an account which hopefully has multiple assets, if you're risk averse."
"Multiple kinds of investments, a bond, a stock, and we'll talk about those."
"You put $10,000 every year, why 10,000 fixed amount?"
"Well, nothing is forcing you to put 10,000 every year."
"It can be 11,000 one year, 9,000 the other."
"But oddly enough, to make life simple perhaps, many people tend to put away a certain amount of money every year for things they need in the future."
"So, the notion of a pension fund is at some point I'm going to retire and I need some money."
"So, you put away 10,000 every year."
"You plan to retire in about 40 years, and expect to earn eight percent on your portfolio."

"Thank you for joining us for Managing Content on Shared Drives, a recorded web seminar delivered by the US National Archives and Records Admministration's"
National Records Management Training Program.
"In this online briefing from August 2012, Beth Cron from the Office of the Chief Records Officer shares tips on managing electronic records and other content on shared drives."
Let's join the seminar.
Paulette Murray:
My name is Paulette Murray and I'm with the National Archives and Records Administration.
I'm very excited to get today's online briefing started.
"Today we will have Beth Cron, and she'll be discussing managing content on shared drives."
These online briefings were created by NARA to present current records management subjects to a widely geographically dispersed audience.
We'd like to thank you for attending today.
This series of online briefings will allow us to maximize our limited government resources.
This briefing will last approximately one hour.
"This hour will include a presentation on the topic for approximately 30 minutes, and then we'll open up for question and answer."
"As your phones are on mute, and if you have called in, please feel free to use the chat box to ask any questions during the presentation or during the question and answer sessions."
"Today's briefing is titled Managing Content on Shared Drives, and we have Beth Cron with us today."
Beth is a member of the Records Management Policy section within the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
"Her team developed the NARA bulletin ""Guidance on Managing Content on Shared Drives"" and it was released in December 2011."
This webinar is based on research and content of this bulletin.
"The Records Management Policy Team has also produced guidance on Web 2.0 and social media records, cloud computing, and e-mail archiving applications."
Check out the Records Express Blog updates for the latest news from the Office of the Chief Records Officer.
And with that said I would like to introduce Beth Cron.
Beth Cron:
"Thank you, Paulette."
Good afternoon and good morning to those of you in other time zones.
I just want to say thank you and welcome to the webinar for today.
First of all I'll provide you a little bit of background on the shared drives bulletin and how it came about.
"Based on feedback that we received from agencies and NARA staff, our management decided that we should develop a bulletin on managing shared drives."
"Through development of the bulletin, we interviewed a number of agencies on the configuration of their shared drives and asked them about any reorganization projects that they've done on their shared drives."
"But with attacking two chemicals, so, being a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, we can sometimes see benefit and therapeutic outcomes."
So you have to balance this spectrum.
"So, the first group we're going to talk about is the SNRls, which is the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors."
So this is a reuptake pump inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine.
"So we're not only going to prevent serotonin from being sucked back up by the brain, and not be able to be used, but we're going to increase norepinephrine in the same manner."
"The first SNRI is Venlafaxine, and this is"
Effexor and Effexor XR.
"This is dosed twice a day, anywhere from 75-300mg total."
Your mechanism of action is as a SNRl.
We have a couple different indications.
"How this drug needs to be managed is, we need to go slow in terms of initiation."
We need a slow titration because of the side effect profile.
"Again, this medication is a very effective medication to be used, but it needs to be titrated slowly, because there are a lot of side effects."
So it's very difficult to get patients on and off of this medication.
The nausea and diarrhea is very severe.
"This situation, you actually want to use the extended release preparation, because there are"
less side effects associated with the extended release.
"Similar side effects to the SSRls: headaches, sexual side effects, the increase in anxiety, and insomnia."
"We do see an increase in blood pressure, especially as we get to the higher doses of the medicine, and it's usually isolated systolic increase."
"So you have to use this with caution in certain patient populations, potentially."
"And again, use that long-acting formulation to avoid side effects."
"Interestingly enough, with this medication, you need to be at the higher end of the dosing spectrum to get that double-action effect."
"At the lower end, in initiation of the medication, up until about 150mg, you're really only getting action as an SSRl, so as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
You're not hitting both neurotransmitters until the higher level dosing.
"Again, I mentioned this medication needs to be titrated slowly: there's a significant withdrawal, again, with the medicine, so, like I said, it's very hard to get on and off of, but it's a very effective medication in treatment."
The next SNRI is one of our newest antidepressants:
"Duloxetine, or Cymbalta."
"Anywhere from 20-60mg a day, and, again, an SNRl."
The main difference with this is that patients get the dual action right away.
"Versus Venlafaxine, it took to get to the higher dosing spectrum."
This we get right away.
"Nausea, insomnia, and headache are the most reported side effects."
It's a  in German or Northern Germany where there is a wreath of greenery and then typically four candles set in a square fashion around this circular wreath.
And it would sit on the table.
"And so she wanted to make them go sideways, she was drawing a fold out drawing of the wreath and its four candles as her first drawing."
"Um, as an adult."
"So my suggestion to you is, don't think that it is necessary to start at some peculiar place which they must have, like three-dimensional objects, then move to representations of those, like a sculpture, then slip away another dimension and go to ."
Then slip away another dimension and go to two dimensions.
No - just drop them in the deep end and say please draw.
And you'll find they will do lines for surface edges without asking you what can a line stand for. and _.
"And they will start learning shapes that are relevant and they will start using spacial systems that are like sighted children, and then they will themselves mature as they themselves evaluate their own drawings."
"By the way, the box that I was asking her to draw was exactly a _ matte the box that you could fold up and put in my pocket, complicated enough that it would be a challenge for anybody and so it was a nice sort of task: draw a cube, draw a table, draw a glass, draw a hand, draw _ box."
These are examples of things that you can offer people as targets and they will draw them and they will criticize their own drawings and be satisfied with some parts and then drive themselves into more sophisticated drawings.
"Okay, is that enough?"
Constance:
"Okay, I know that there is other questions."
Dr. Kennedy:
"I am happy to stay, love talking about this, love to know your experiences."
Constance:
"Clearly, again another very passionate person with lots of information."
So Dr. Kennedy will be at the back and thank you
Dr. Kennedy:
My pleasure.

"My favourite Prime Minister is this man right here, Winston Churchill,"
"He was an incredible leader for our country, and indeed the whole free world at the most impossibly difficult time."
"Just a few yards away from here is the Cabinet Room, and Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister sat in that Cabinet Room, and decided, with his colleagues, to fight on against Nazi Germany and Hilter, even after France had fallen."
"That was a heroic decision, a right decision, and actually meant the world was saved from Nazi tyranny."
"It was the most important moment in British history, and I think it's because of his courage and guts that we made the right call."
NEWS READER:
"""Behind Winston Churchill we stand united as never before in history."""
"Well, obviously, he came to office in 1940, at a desperately difficult time; France was about to fall, the war was going extraordinarily badly from Britain's point of view, Hitler was rampant across Europe."
"It looked like the end for the free world, the end for Britain, and the end for"
Churchill too.
And those are the pieces of wood.
Those are the instructions.
"These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up."
"What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut."
"All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before."
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
"And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built."
"There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here."
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
"It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool."
"It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks."
"It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long."
"Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side."
"They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured."
And they were able to do it.
"That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck."
They were able to create that.
They were able to create something wonderful.
"They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology."
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
"It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face."
Here it is going across.
"And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur."
"Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may."
"Woo, pretty, huh."
This is the other side of the coin.
"This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today."
"The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion."
"It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition."
"""When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,"" said the owner."
"Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
It's where they combine all of the things that they've learned through this class and doing it for a large cooking group.
"At first they're scared, but generally by the end, and it's all done they're really happy with their results."
"They felt like they've made a good product, they've pleased the people that they have been producing their meal for and they've had fun."
I liked it where it combined everything that they could do in their class and give them some practical experience in what they've learned.

How to Study for an Online Course
"To be successful in any course, you will need to develop good study habits."
"Much like face-to-face courses, one aspect related to studying for an online course is your study environment."
As you discovered earlier in the module each person has their own learning style.
Your learning style should be taken into consideration when selecting your study environment.
"Some individuals need a very quiet place to study to be able to concentrate; others need music, or other sound, in the background."
"Contrary to some people's belief, studying with the TV on is not usually effective."
"Also, your learning style will help you decide if you should study by yourself or in a study group."
"Choose the location where you study carefully, taking into mind that it needs to have good lighting, be at a comfortable temperature, and be free from distractions."
"To study successfully, you must manage your time effectively."
"Make sure to schedule adequate time over the course of the week to watch lecture videos, read course materials, work o"
Good afternoon!
"I am the only ex 87 detainee speaking speaking and as most of the speakers have spoken in English and will be in English, I would like to speak in Mandarin."
Ok!
"Dear citizens, dear friends, it has been 25 years!"
I was asked why the sudden hype this year when you guys had all along been keeping a low profile.
"Not so! we had on several occasions in the past, marked the event in different ways."
"This year is a special year, we are very happy to see so many of you attending."
It's 25 years passed.
"In 1987, 16 citizens were arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in the first round with 6 more in the second."
"Two more were added in the following year, which makes the total 24, of whom many are still nursing the wounds or have not been able to forget that sudden twist of fate."
Those arrested had different encounters.
"""Beyond the Blue Gate"", a book written by lawyer Teo Soh Lung, has given a more detailed accounts of life in prison."
"Her account was interspersed with sometimes high-handed treatment, sometimes hilarious moments."
Other detainees have also reminisced about their prison ordeals.
"As far as I am concerned, I started off not knowing what the ISD (Internal Security Department) officers wanted from me."
Basically we're getting a lot of donations.
And with those donations we're using to buy supplies and food for everyone.
This is our dish washing area.
"And we have feeding tables here, it's like a buffet."
And all our storage is in the center.
And that's our donation area over there.
"The importance of having a strong media presence is unquestioinable, i mean, we need to have very powerful, positive media representation."
"And if we're not getting it from the mainstream media outlets,"
Then we've got to do it and create it ourselves.
"We're not allowed to erect any structures here in the plaza, so we're not allowed to put up any tents, we're not allowed to hang anything from the trees,"
"So when it rains, we pretty much just have to cover everything with tarps."
"We have one generator, I think another one just came recently,"
"We're running laptops, recharging batteries, recharging cell phones."
"We have a bunch of shooters, people out filming, who have signed up for different shifts, or have basically just showed up and said,"
"""Look, i have a camera, I'm ready to film."""
"We send them out to go film a workshop, or a march or a protest, whatever, and then they come back and we have an ingest department, where they ingest the footage, transcode it, whatever needs to be done,"
"And then give it to an editor, who either edits here, or in an off-campus location to bring it back to upload."

I love my freedoms and this is my street!
I won't be surrendering because I have freedom in my streets!
"Yeah, we'll focus on that, all right?"
"Let me know if it's too much pressure or not, all right?"
"It's a stressfull environment, you're always going to have people kind of itching for some kind of confrontation, and this is anti-confrontational."
"This really can do a lot for people, you know?"
"Bring down stress levels, and you think differently, you speak differently, so if they're in a confrontation with someone else here because they've been sleeping out here for two weeks, or a police officer or a heckler, they might handle it in a calmer, more rational way."

"But they can be very substantial victims, I mean, in this case in Afghanistan, individual soldiers who have lost their lives, have lost all their life."
However it is true that the kill ratios for this war are disturbing.
"So, the event that I just showed you before, of 181 people being killed,"
There was one US soldier who died versus 181 people who were claimed to be Taliban.
When you have kill ratios like that war becomes indiscriminate.
And when the vehicles for killing are aerial

Ann please.
Thank you.
My name is Ann Linda.
I'm from the Social Democratic Party and I have two questions.
"One is the most attention has been given to those leaks that have been about war, in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Are you intentionally trying to get [your] most attention to these or are you also trying to get attention, for example, on exploitation, child work, or forced labor, or things like that."
Or is it peace and war that are
Wikileaks' main area of concentration?
"And the second question is do you care how the material you get is gotten, in a way?"
"And the question is because in Sweden, to simplify it, if you are in authority and say something to journalists, the authorities cannot see from where the leak is."
That's forbidden.
"But if someone is trying to break in to get the same material, then it's forbidden."
And they could be taken to court.
Do you care if somebody breaks in to get the material or do you only take material that someone on the inside has given to you?
Yea.
"For focus, we are very clear to prospective whistleblowers and journalists or other people who have been censored what we do and do not do."
I think that is one of our strengths as a media organization is that we do not see ouselves as merely representing an opinion and then looking for news that backs up that opinion.
Rather we see our role as representatives of people who have information to provide the public.
We see our role like lawyers.
Lawyers represent their clients to a court and to a jury.
"We represent sources, whistleblowers and people whose freedom of speech is under threat to the jury of public opinion."
And so we try and get as much impact for their material as possible.
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching.
"It's a beautiful picture, right?"
All that white coral.
Except it's supposed to be brown.
"What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them."
"And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection."
"But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar."
"The corals say, ""You cheated."
"You didn't pay your rent."""
"They kick them out, and then they die."
"Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news."
"To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked."
"And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves."
"And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,"
"""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."""
"Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died."
"And then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum."
"But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks, the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts."
"And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?"
"I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it."
But what does that mean?
We really don't know.
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years?
"Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc."
"And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean."
"Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it, because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette."
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom; sometimes you don't.
That doesn't sell.
"The really scary things though are the physical, chemical, oceanographic things that are happening."
"As the surface of the ocean gets warmer, the water is lighter when it's warmer, it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over."
We say it becomes more strongly stratified.
"The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse."
"A mysterious, massive cluster of stars, that we'd now call a galaxy."
"And back then, what we could know about the universe was limited by the amount of data that we could collect, and things just aren't the same anymore."
"Modern astrophysics looks not like this, but like this."
A picture of a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
"Each dot, an individual system of  hundreds of billions of suns."
"And if we want to understand the evolution of the universe, if we want to understand how we got this wonderful universe that we see around us, we need to study these galaxies."
But there's a problem.
The problem is that we don't really like the universe that we've ended up with.
We've got this 96% of the universe in a form that we don't understand.
In dark matter and dark energy.
And so we need to pay closer attention to each one of these millions and billions of galaxies.
"We need to treat them not as points of light, but as individual spirals or galaxies, because the shapes of the galaxies tell us about their history."
So you can tell that this spiral galaxy  has had a very different past from a big ball of stars that we call the elliptical.
That's what we set out to do.
We set out to try and identify the shapes of the galaxies.
And that's a task that humans are much better at than computers.
"We're very good at this sort of pattern recognition task, and computers are really rather poor."
"We tried getting a student to look at a million galaxies, and I can tell you that, after about  the first 50,000, they give up."
And so we needed a new solution.
We decided to call for help.
"We set up a web site called ""Galaxy Zoo""."
This is what it looks like today.
"And Galaxy Zoo asked everyone in the world to help us classify these galaxies, to say what shape they are."
"And on the first couple of days at Galaxy Zoo, we got this amazing response."
"We were doing 70,000 galaxy classifications every hour."
"And while we haven't continued at that speed, over time, we've done hundreds of millions of classifications from hundreds of thousands of people."
"And the even better news is that, taken together, those classifications are more accurate than those supplied by professional astronomers."
"The crowd does not make mistakes, and it has endless enthusiasm for this task of sorting through pictures of the universe."
But actually that's not the interesting part.
Something else very interesting happens when you invite hundreds of thousands of people  to take part in your research.
"What happens is that you have to remember that yes, there's a crowd, but the crowd is made up of individuals."
So here's one of our classifiers.
It's to be distracted and allow the environment and stimuli in the environment to control our attention.
"So yeah I think it was the book and other developments that trained us to pay attention, but the fact that that was has been a fairly short part of our history doesn't mean we should give it up easily, but cherish it all the more and protect it all the more."
PETER NORVlG:
I'm all for protecting it.
And we are going to go to questions in a few minutes.
There's the mic so if people want to ask questions please line up there.
And while we're doing that I just want to mention one more thing which is maybe the book that is closest to yours that's popular now is Clay Shorkey's Cognitive Surpluses and he talks about what he calls cognitive surpluses is this idea that its the thing television stole form us
"That in history from most of history, we had to spend all of our time just sort of surviving."
"And then in modern society, we got this new notion of leisure time and that was something that never existed before, and then television took it away to the tune 200 Billion hours a year in the U.S. alone."
"And clay points out, if one percent of the TV watchers throughout the world stop watching TV, and did something useful, they could produce two Wikipedias a week."
(Laughter)
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Just what we need (more laughter)
PETER NORVlG:
What's your comment on Clay's take?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I think Clay's a very smart guy and think he's a very hopeful guy and if in fact we see that change in behavior that would be a good thing, but what we know from the statistics is that TV viewing hours have gone up throughout the entire era of the web and in fact they hit their highest era since the Neilson Company began monitoring TV last year."
"And if you had to those TV hours which are now at the highest point ever, all the time we waste online as opposed to creating Wikipedia or doing other useful things, you see the time we waste with media today is enormous and far greater in the Hey day of Television. yeah we might all start changing and getting together and creating all kinds of things or we might still continue to waste a lot of time online and TV."
I don't know.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay let's go to questions.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Start from this side.
MAN 1:
"I haven't read you book yet, but I have a question for you."
Part of growing up is making breaks in your past.
For me growing up was going away to school and then from school going to another school and from there going to another school and then finally moving away.
And going to start working.
And you took these points in my life and I had to choose who I was going to stay in touch with.
"One of the things with that the previous talk with the Facebook of that and these social networks, you have to choose who not to stay in touch with and how is that part of making us smarter and making us dumber in that conversation?"
"How is staying with the burden of your choices as a young person, is that holding people back?"
"And is that, I went through all these breaks before the internet and I'm sure you probably did to."
"In this universe of shades it's easy to misinterpret things, easy to distort things and use them in your own benefit."
"And I think it's hard, and a stage is opening up where everything is going to be like that."
"Where there are going to be so many shades in the network that anyone can interpret reality according to their will, because everything will be true, but if that is allowed to happen, truth will be betrayed."
"A stage is opening up in the net where nothing is as it used to be, and political affiliation is not what it used to be, there's no sense in using the same glasses to look."
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me how you organised the coverage, both during the 15M and after 15O (october)."
"From a logistic point of view too, how many people, why, how... because there is one thing that's true, you've produced so much."
"You have so much text many photos, many videos, many everything... tell me how you did it and how you organised it."
JL:
Periodismo Humano is not a live media outlet.
We don't do this often.
"Being constantly in the street sending tweets and social network updates is an exception, when we see that we can offer something that no-one else is offering."
Because there's no sense in doing what the other media corporations are doing.
"Periodismo Humano's specialty is features written with care and dedication, with text, interviews, chronicles."
We don't do live updates.
Actually during the 15M we didn't give live updates.
What we did was a dual velocity journalism.
"On the one hand we were in the street talking about everything that we saw, using Twitter as a public notebook."
When you spend 12 hours in the Puerta del Sol talking about what you're seeing and afterwards you have to write something up at 4 in the morning when you got home.
Because there comes a moment when you have to write at 4 in the morning and... what material can you use?
What inputs do you use to write your feature?
"Well, everything you've tweeted."
"You go over your tweets, you see the sensations you've felt during the day and you decide how to write your chronicle."
And using videos that have been uploaded all day.

"Rational numbers, integers, whole numbers, and natural numbers were infinite but a particular type of infinite he called ""countable""."
"Irrational numbers were also infinite, but what he called ""uncountable"" a much larger infinity than the countable rational numbers."
Cantor established a hierarchy of infinities.
We saw that real numbers are formed by combining the rational numbers and the irrational numbers.
Since real numbers include irrational numbers which are uncountable real numbers are also uncountable.
"In other words, the infinite collection of real numbers is the same size infinity as the infinite collection of irrational numbers."
Unlike the rational and irrational numbers every point on the number line corresponds to some real number.
If you randomly pick a point on the number line it will always correspond to a real number.
There are no gaps in the real number line.
This means that you can move smoothly between any two points and never encounter anything but real numbers.
"Since there are no gaps, the real numbers form a continuum a property which is essential for calculus."
So now we know that between any pair of irrational numbers are an infinite number of rational numbers and between any pair of rational numbers are an infinite number of irrational numbers.
And don't forget that there are infinitely more irrational numbers than rational numbers.
If this makes your head want to explode then congratulations!
You are on your way to becoming a mathematician.

I can actually see my work start growing. and I would have liked to have given back to the community by working within the community of Rochester. and working with other nonprofits as well.
"Yes, 0.4 is the product of these two values over here."
"So, in reality the solution is just to apply the product p1 * p2, and hitting the 1 button gives me indeed 0.4."
I can now go and change this probability to 0.1 and 0.8.
"You probably already figured out that the answer is now 0.08, and indeed, my code gives me the following result, 0.08."
"On July 4th, 2012, physicists in Geneva, Switzerland, made an earth-shattering announcement."
They discovered what we call the Higgs boson.
"A particle, an elementary piece of nature, that we've been searching for for over 40 years."
"And around the world, hundreds of millions of people tuned in and said to themselves,"
What in the world is a Higgs boson?
It's a very good question.
"The Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman once called the Higgs boson the God particle, and for years thereafter, physicists have been shaking their fists at him, because the Higgs boson has nothing whatsoever to do with God."
But it is very very important.
"It's important enough that the world spent over 9 billion dollars to build the Large Hadron Collider, the most complicated machine ever built, to search for the Higgs and particles like it."
"It's a ring, 17 miles around, 300 feet under ground, that goes beneath the border of France and Switzerland."
"If you are walking around in the fields, you would see just mountains, and fields, and cows, but underneath your feet, there'd be this machine that takes protons and accelerates them close to the speed of light, smashes them together to make new particles."
And we found one: the Higgs boson.
I'm Sean Carroll.
"I'm a physicist at CalTech, and I was there in Geneva on July 4th, 2012, for the Higgs discovery announcements."
"I saw the young physicists camping out overnight, waiting for good seats in the seminar room."
I heard the standing ovation when the announcements of the discovery were made.
"[Joe Incandela:] ""...five standard deviations."""
"I saw people get a little emotional, a little teared-up, at this discovery that we've waited decades to achieve."
"In one sense, the Higgs is the end an era."
"In my new book, ""The Particle At The End Of The Universe"", I try to explain why this was so important."
"Why this smart, dedicated people put so much effort into finding this little particle."
"What it is is the completion of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the atoms that make up you, and me, and everything we see in our everyday lives."
But understanding that part doesn't give us all the answers to the questions we have.
We still want to know:
"But Berlioz trolled Paganini by wrote him a symphony  ""Harold in Italy"" instead of a concerto"
Paganini was so mad that he didn't play the  piece and not even attend the premiere.
The viola has missed the opportunity to rise again.
After many springs and winters until the 20th century in England has appeared our father of viola Tertis
He fully understand that the problem that the  viola doesn't have any good pieces he can counted as the first person who asked and  paid many composers to write songs for the viola
"Therefore, formally speaking, the viola starts it's development from the 20th century"
Talking about 20th century
It's hard to not mention Primrose
He is like the viola version of Paganini
He had already play all Paganini's Caprices with his viola
He started playing as violist before playing the viola but he then never touches the violin anymore
He had say something gold
I personally can't agree more with his words (and that's what I think)
"You are more then welcome to jealous us, violists."
The viola seemed like being ignored for ages but after watching this video now you know what viola is what difficulties it was facing
Viola has a fast development especially it has just started from the 20th century
"Like vegetables, they were just sides in many dishes now they are treat on their own like salad and more!"
Dear fellow violists
If there are people asking you what instrument do you play
"You shall say ""the viola"" very firmly"
Like a boss
If he then ask what's the differences between the violin and the viola? then you can act like a boss and say
"The viola has a nice sound, it is just  different from (or better then) the violin"
"Now, the 1st episode of the E-symphony has now come to an end"
"If you have additional info about viola or want to know  more about other musical knowledges (eg. instruments, composes, music genres)"

"So student Lisa asks, what would be different in world where almost everyone was programming"
literate.
So this is the core question and obviously
I feel that it would be great to have such a world thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to take this class and hope youÃ¢ÂÂil encourage any non programming literate people that you know to take the next version in this class starting in April.
"There are lots of things that understanding programming even at just a basic level and I think many of you are beyond the basic level now if youÃ¢ÂÂve made it this far in CS101, but in terms of the things that you interact with and the things that you see in the world, almost all of them are controlled by programs these days and people who understand programming can relate to those things and have better way than people who donÃ¢ÂÂt."
"And some of this can be sort of fairly obvious things when you interact with a website and you can tell, well theyÃ¢ÂÂve got some bugging it because the programmer didnÃ¢ÂÂt think of that both branches of the NlFT test and if you are a programmer or you at least understand about programming that you maybe have a better sense of what is going on but you also can get a lot more familiar by it because you know well this is something any programmer who knows what they are doing should have test before and understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on and itÃ¢ÂÂs really annoying that you have to deal with their mistake."
Other things you probably have a better understanding of how complicated it is and how hard it is to get things right that you might be a
"little more forgiving when things break and have better ideas about well this is probably why itÃ¢ÂÂs breaking, letÃ¢ÂÂs try to use this tool or use this product in some slightly different way."
So thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the reasons.
The other reason I think is there are lots of things that people encounter every day that if you know a little bit about programming instead of doing a lot of tedious work as a human you can find a way to automate that and save yourself a lot ofÃ¢ÂÂ¦
There is a good example of this right here in our office.
"So when recording these video we generate hundreds every week to get the classes out for all these courses and they are all named kind of default things by the video camera and video X, X,"
It also does not compensate for your contribution as writer to different articles.
It is open.
Anyone can write and edit and debate.
And this dynamic changes both the number of articles and details of many articles very.
Dynamically.
"Sometimes as soon as announcement is made in the public or event happens within a minute or sometimes right at the same time as that event unfolds, it is updated."
It's interactive.
"There's talk page, there's history page, you can interact with the other contributors or the editors."
And it is extensively linked.
"In fact, when you Google search certain kind of our keywords, Wikipedia articles are popped up."
And then you can look at each Wiki article.
There are many hyperlinks embedded in the text and a many footnotes at the bottom.
"So, the Wiki articles themselves also form."
A very large and substantially linked network.
There are perhaps more links per node than then the general web space and there are many such nodes.
"With in a decade since founding Wikipedia has already has 4,000,000 english articles and all together 27,000,000 articles in many different languages."
"So, by all accounts, wikipedia has been very successful."
"It is not, however, the first attempt to build an encyclopedia online, not even the first attempt to build it based on free open dynamic interactions."
So there must be something that they did right and better than the previous attempts.
We'll be looking at those momentarily.
"At the same time, we also recognize there are limitations."
"For example, there are misinformations."
"Some information on Wiki's are just rang, wrong, especially in articles with a very small audience."
"But what is important is that we can provide our effective, self-correcting mechanism."
Usually the misinformation on Rose and
Lily popular weekend articles are very effectively corrected by the community of contributors.
"There are also just mistakes, honest mistakes."
"But then again, everybody can edit an article."
"An edit can stay there as long as no other contributors can present a better, stronger case otherwise."
Then there are also missing information.
No encyclopedia can include all the information you want.
Different people also have different definitions of what constitute an encyclopedic kind of article.
"""This is unbelievable information."""
"And as I began to move through this,"
I realized that we spend more on healthcare in this country than any other country in the world.
And that disease doesn't know party lines.
Cancer doesn't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat.
We spend 16 cents of every dollar in this country managing disease.
"And as I thought about that, I thought,"
"""None of us can do everything, but all of us can do something."""
"And right now, we've got this prototype, this new technology in our food supply."
"And I thought, it's kind of like the fax machine - you know, maybe it served its purpose there for a while, but the two products that it's brought us have allowed an increased spraying of weedkiller, and for something to produce its own insecticide, and maybe it's time for a new technology."
"Because right now, these farmers, they sign End User Agreements, where they have to license the use of this technology, they're charged royalty fees, trait fees, licensing fees."
I spent time with these guys on their farms - and this is not the farming that their grandfathers did.
"At the same time, the Department of Justice is investigating this stuff because of the monopolistic practices, the way that these seed companies can increase their prices five to ten percent in order to drive shareholder return."
"And while none of us can do everything, all of us can do one thing."
Because each and every single one of us has something that we are uniquely good at.
"And when you leverage that with something that you're passionate about, you can create extraordinary change."
"And as I leaned into this - you know people were trying to call me an activist, and they were trying to call me an advocate - and I just thought none of those terms hit me quite right, because I realized that this was so totally inspired by love."
"And I thought, what do you call people who are working and totally inspired by love to restore the health of our country, and to create a better way?"
"And I realized that our country was founded on that spirit, and that you really simply call us citizens."
"And so I invite you to lend your talents, to find a friend, so that together, we can create the change that we want to see in the health of our families, and the health of our food system, and in the health of our country."
Thank you.

Yeah - Close the mind !
No reason why efficiency has to be boring.

&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; We are now going to discuss the multivariate normal distribution.
The multivariate normal distribution is a very important distribution in finance.
"It crops up in many different applications including, for example, mean variance analysis and asset allocation, as well as geometric Brownian motion and the"
Black-Scholes[UNKNOWN].
"So we say an n-dimensional vector, X, is multivariate normal with mean vector Mu and covariance matrix Sigma; if the PDF of"
X is given to us by this quantity here.
"Okay, so the PDF is equal to 1 over 2 pi to the power of n over 2, times the terminant of the covarience matrix raised to the power of a half, times the exponential of this quantity up here."
"And be right that X is multivariate normal Mu, sigma."
"The little subscript n here, denotes the dimensionality of the vector x."
"The standard multivariate normal, has mean vector mu equal to 0, and variance covariance matrix equal to the n by n identity matrix."
"And in this case, the xi's are independent."
"We can actually see that, because in this case we can write, the joint PD f of x, as being equal to the product."
I equals one to in.
One over route to pie e to the minus a half x i squared.
"And that follows just from this line here because mu equals zero so this term disappears, and Sigma is just the identity."
"So, in fact, you just end up with a sum of xi squared divided by 2."
So as we saw in an earlier module on multivariant distributions.
"If the joint PDF factorizes into a product of marginal PDF's, then the random variables are independent."
Okay.
The moment generating function of x is given to us by this quantity here.
So phi subscript x of s is actually a function of s.
Okay this vector s.
"You may say, ""But the water is cold!"""
You need to understand that there is nothing that is not energy
"### and the water, no matter how fast it is occurring internally, is energy. ###"
"Put your hand into the cold water, then get some warm water and put your hand into the warm water, and try to feel."
"If you are somewhere that windy hard, try to learn with the wind, to feel the wind."
"There is one thing we don't pay much attention, but our chakras work with types of energy."
"For example, the sex chakra, what kind of energy does it work with?"
"It works with dense energies, it will work with pasty energies, right?"
"It will work with energies like the wind, it works with that energy."
Any energy that touches your body is identified by your sex chakra.
"So, these are the energies that sex chakra will deals with."
"For example, water is a liquid energy, but it can handle that energy, it responds to it."
This answer will be better defined according to the competence of your chakra.
"So if you take, for example, the coronary chakra, it does a very different reading than sex chakra."
"If you, for example, touch the water, the same water you are touching with your hands, to feel the sex chakra, pour a bit of this water over your head and try to feel."
Perhaps you'll be able to perceive the difference that exists in the perception of each chakra.
"You may say ""But I'm using my hands"""
"No, you can use the foot, you can use any part of the body."
"But when I'm talking about coronary chakra,"
"I'm certainly speaking about the farthest chakra of sex chakra, where perceptions are different."
"If you do something with the other chakras that are close to the sex chakra you'll not be able to fell, you'll not be able to perceive the difference."
"So, sex chakra and coronary chakra, will provide different perceptions."
You can also perceive this when the wind touch on your face.
"Feel the wind on your face and then feel the wind on your legs, check if there is a difference in perception."
"If you are very emotional, this difference hardly appears."
"If your consciousness is already at heart chakra, at the top or above, it becomes very clear."
"It's the same process for a person who is clairvoyant, when a person can see more images and distinguish better than someone else."
"So if you show someone a landscape, that landscape can be read in many ways."
"A person who is very advanced level, the reading of everything is much more acurated."
It's like you looking at a person.
"If you look at a person, the person is composed of many items."
Someone will look and not see anything and the other will see many details in that person.

"Fatiha, amin. salam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu. for those of you who didnt pray your uh... tarawih. we have already prayed, so pray your tarawih, pray your isha, pray your tarawih, inshAllah ar-Rahman"
"If Allah give us the lives, we will see each other again, salam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.  have a good night"
Let's look at some of the options you can use with replica sets.
"The config we used earlier, we didn't use any options, we just used the defaults."
"And as you saw, that worked pretty well."
"But there are some options available for your use, so"
let's go through some of those.
"So, if we look at the configuration we used before, we'll see here we basically just have the host names we want to use."
"They have ordinal IDs, the name of the set, and that's basically it."
"This version field is added by the server, and it will just keep track of changes to the configuration and increment the version on each change, so that we can notice changes, and helps the different members the set know if they have the latest version of the config or not."
"They talk to each other, and if someone else has a newer version, they will grab it, then."
"So, for example, you can do re-configurations when a member is down."
"So, a set has a configuration, we might want to change it, right?"
"Something's changed, new server, new replication factor, whatever."
We may want to change.
"That can be done, of course."
"So if you imagine we had a set, we'll just go with the case where there's three servers again, which is the common case, and they're all running, it's all fine."
"Maybe something like this, primary, secondary, secondary."
We're running along.
Imagine the server goes down.
"Even with the server down, we can still do a reconfiguration of the set."
"To do a reconfigure of the set requires that the majority of the members of the set, of the voters, are up."
"So, we have a majority."
"We have one, two out of three."
"So that's a majority, proper majority, so we can do it."
"And what we'll do is we'll use the replSetReconfig command, which has helpers."
"For example, rs.reconfig in the shell is a helper."
"But you will send that command to the primary of the set, and if a majority of the set is up, you will have a primary, and then you can do that."
"So, if we consider now a reconfiguration occurring on the set, and we were on, say, V1 of the set's config, and everyone has a local copy of that in local.system.replSet collection, if the set's been initiated, they'll have that."
"So that document's currently on version colon one, which,"
"In terms of the budget and the Grand Bargain, what we're hearing is the discussion, especially on the Senate side between democrats and republicans, is to do another Grand"
Bargain.
The additional tax increases won't be what you call a big tax increase.
They will go in and change the tax loopholes.
They will eliminate some of the big tax loopholes that benefit some high earners and some big businesses like Exxon and others.
But if they can get the tax code to where it ought to be they will generate probably another $600 million in tax revenues.
And the President started a big bruha amongst the democrats and the republicans last week where he's actually beginning to start talking about cutting some of the entitlement programs.
"We're talking about Medicare, Medicaid, Social"
"Security, beginning to make some cuts on those because so many of the Baby Boomers are retiring and entering into that retirement workforce."
And that is ballooning those costs associated with it.
So that is the deal.
Can you increase the taxes by closing loopholes enough and can you increase revenue enough on the other side to spur economic growth and to rebuild the infrastructure and then keep the country from going into a recession.
We think the politics are excellent in the Senate.
It's hard to say what's going to happen in the House.
But there is some discussion that hopefully some of the regulars of the
"Republican Party will begin to talk with Boehner, can begin to talk with members of the House."
"And it may be a situation where it won't be a majority bill in the house, but if Republicans and Democrats are free to vote on the issues themselves when it comes to the budget there may be enough votes to cobble together some democrats and some republicans to get something passed in a Grand Bargain or in a budget."
"The downside of that is with the Republican Party trending so far to the right now is that most republicans don't necessarily fear a democratic challenger in the next election, but they fear an even more conservative member of the party upending them in a primary."
That's the politics of it.
So we don't know what's going to happen in the House.
I know there is some work going on.
I know the
"President is having these meetings now with republican individuals separately with lunches, dinners, and everything else, and also collectively."
We hope all of that will come to some sort of fruition.
I will speak a little bit more about CSBG after the conclusion of the CSBG presentation.
Brad:
"Great, Arley."
"Thank you very, very much for that overview, and let's turn to Mark Schmeissing who is the NASCSP"
Acting Director for Research for CSBG.
"Mark has been analyzing the numbers for CSBG and it looks like we've got some pretty big challenges on our hands, Mark."
Mark:
"Thanks, Brad."
A little bit of code on this side.
[Inaudible].
Okay.
Pop empty cell.
I've got that.
"Oh,"
"I think I may have proved, oh, it deliberately makes the error, in fact."
That it was designed to test on that.
[Inaudible] up to the end.
"So let's see if we get back a three, two, one out of this guy."
Okay.
So we manage to do okay even on that.
"So looking at this piece of code, all right, the two operations we're most interested in, push and pop, right, are each oh of one, right."
"The number of elements out there, right, aren't changing anything about its performance."
"It does a little bit of imagination and a little bit of pointer arrangement up here to the front to the end and so it has a very nice tight allocation strategy, too, which is appealing relative to what the vector-based strategy was doing."
"It's like, now, it's doing things in advance on our behalf like extending our capacity so that every now and then we had some"
"little glitch right when you were doing that big resize operation that happened infrequently, you won't have that same concern with this one because it does exactly what it needs at any given time, which is allocate a single cell, deletes a single cell, and also keeping the allocation very tidy in that way."
So they'll both end of being oh of one.
And both of these are commonly used viable strategies for how a stack is implemented.
Right.
"Depending on the, you know, just the inclination of the program or they may have decided one way was the way to go versus another that you will see both used in common practice because there really isn't one of them that's obviously better or obviously worse, right."
"Now, this uses a little bit more memory per cell, but then you have excess capacity and vector has excess capacity but no overhead per cell."
There's a few other things to kind of think about trading off.
"You say, well, the code, itself, is a little harder to write if you're using only [inaudible]."
"That means it's a little bit more error prone and more likely, you'll make a mistake and have to do debug your way through it and the way with the vector it was pretty easy to get without tearing out your hair."
"Now, if we can do stack and queue that fast -"
"I mean, stack that fast, then you figure queue must be not so crazy either."
Let me draw you a picture of queue.
Okay.
I've got my queue and I can use the
"End queue operation on it to put in a 10, to put in a 20, to put in a 30."
And
"You didn't get that parking ticket that irked you so much... or you, unfortunately, never met your wife."
Anything that is physically possible actually does occur... in some other parallel universe.
"It means that in one universe, Elvis Presley is still alive."
In a different level-one universe...
George W. Bush is the baseball commissioner.
Or perhaps we don't exist at all in some of these universes.
The implications are staggering.
And if the universe is infinite... and there really are all these level-one universes... in the infinite multiverse... all those other possibilities did somewhere happen.
"Technically, there are a couple of ways mathematically... for the universe to be truly infinite... but, essentially, it must be shown to be flat."
The universe seems to be perfectly flat... which means either the universe is flat... or is curved so slightly that we can't see it.
"In this case, the universe would eventually curve back in on itself... and form a hypersphere."
It would then be finite in size and volume... and not flat and infinite.
Another way to look at this is that the universe... may have inflated so quickly and so enormously... that it only looks flat.
Think of a bug walking on a gigantic balloon.
"The larger the balloon, the flatter things get."
"The bug walks in any direction, and the bug says..."
"""Well, the universe seems perfectly flat to me."""
But from a distance... we see that the bug is walking on a gigantic balloon.
But now an amazing new tool... the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or WMAP... is changing everything.
Some say the remarkable images reveal the true shape of the universe.
"What we have here are baby pictures of the universe... what it looked like when it was only 400,000 years old."
We're looking so far back in time... that the galaxies hadn't even formed yet.
"We just had this dead, diffuse gas which, gradually, overtime... clumped into galaxies, stars, planets."
The WMAP is catching the very earliest signs of creation.
"Officially, it is tasked with measuring radiation..."
left over from the Big Bang.
But now some scientists have devised an experiment... to calculate the overall shape of the universe.
"If I send light rays through space... and make a gigantic triangle, going from us here... out to the farthest edges of what we can see and then back... the angles of those- that triangle should add up to exactly 180 degrees."
If the universe is curved like a balloon... the angles of the giant triangle would add up... to more than 180 degrees.
To find out if the universe is flat or curved... they shot laser beams deep into space... and made a giant light triangle.
"Now we can tell, and the measurement is in... and the answer is, it works beautifully."
The angles add up to exactly 180 degrees.
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
So it must also be on this perpendicular bisector
"And finally, it also is equidistant from A and C. because those are both R away they both sit on the circle"
So it must be on the perpendicular bisector of AC as well
So AC is right over here.
And this is what the interesting thing is
"We're seeing that the three perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of this triangle they do definitely intersect, but they're intersecting at a point outside of that triangle"
And that point is the center of this circle.
"So once again, that last idea is"
"O is equidistant from A and C, so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and C"
Which would look something like this
"So once again, we see that three perpendicular bisectors are intersecting at a unique point and O really is the circumcenter so, if you take any circle and you put any triangle whose vertices all sit on that circle, the center of that circle is its circumcenter"
So we just drew a situation where this is a circumcenter that sits outside of the triangle proper.
So point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle.
And point O is also going to be the circumcenter of this triangle right over here.
It's going to sit on all three perpendicular bisectors and we know that because it's equidistant from all three points of any of these triangles where the vertices sit on the circle itself.

"When you listen to your favourite piece of music, your ears pick up on the very wide range of frequencies, from the deepest rumblings of the bass to the very highest pitched vibrations."
Now imagine your ears were only sensitive to a very limited range of frequencies.
You'd miss out on most of the good stuff!
But that's essentially that situation that astronomers are in.
Our eyes are only sensitive to a very narrow range of light frequencies: visible light.
But we are completely blind to all other forms of electromagnetic radiation.
"However, there are many objects in the Universe that do emit radiation at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"For example, in the 1930s it was discovered by accident that there are radio waves coming from the depths of space."
"Some of these waves have the same frequency as your favourite radio station, but they are much weaker and, of course, there's nothing to listen to."
"In order to ""tune in"" to the radio Universe, you need some sort of receiver: a radio telescope."
Right.
"You're spending more money, time, resources and pension on asset C than it's, that you probably need to in order to comply with management's directive with, with, and with policy."
"When you're doing the base line approach, it's two steps."
The first step is to establish this minimum set of controls.
"And, you would select controls using, using standards and, you know, Barbara I know has talked to you about a number of standards and you're probably aware of other sets of standards."
"I mean, there are no shortage of standards out there. and then, you would make the security check"
list.
"And then, step two is you would analyze the gaps and you'd do that using the checklist."
"And then, when there's a gap, you'd do whatever you need to do in terms of remediation to either close that gap or to reduce the expenditures in areas where your level of control is higher than what's specified by the analysis."

"(Ken Robinson) Every country on Earth, at the moment, is reforming public education."
There are two reasons for it.
The first of them is economic.
People are trying to work out how do we educate our children to take their place in the economies of the 21st century?
How do we do that?
"Even though we can't anticipate what the economy will look like  at the end of next week, as the recent turmoil is demonstrating."
How do we do that?
"The second, though, is cultural."
"Every country on Earth, on earth is trying to figure out how do we educate our children so they have a sense of cultural identity, and so that we can pass on the cultural genes of our communities, while being part of the process of globalization?"
How do we square that circle?
The problem is they're trying to meet the future by doing what they did in the past.
"And on the way, they're alienating millions of kids who don't see any purpose in going to school."
"When we went to school, we were kept there with a story, which is, if you worked hard and did well and got a college degree,  you would have a job."
Our kids don't believe that.
"And they're right not to, by the way."
"You're better having a degree than not, but it's not a guarantee anymore."
And particularly not if the route to it marginalizes most of the things that you think are important about yourself.
"Some people say we have to raise standards, as if this is a breakthrough."
"You know, like, really, yes we should."
Why would you lower them?
[laughter]
I haven't come across an argument that persuades me of lowering them.
"Just like we said there's a set of pizza and movies, all of which leave you indifferent."
How do you decide which pizza and movies to choose?
"Well, you bring in the relative price of pizza and movies."
"Here, we're going to bring in the relative price of capital and labor to determine how we choose between capital and labor."
"So to do that, we're going to draw isocost lines which are going to be just like our old budget constraints."
"Isocost lines which represent the cost of different combinations of inputs, just like our old budget constraint represented the cost of different consumption goods."
"So if you look at figure 9-1, here we're going to have isocost curves which are going to represent-- and we're going to assume here that the wage is $5 an hour, and the rental rate is $10 per unit of capital."
"So, in other words, the $50 isocost line in figure 9-1 shows all combinations of labor and capital that cost $50."
"So you could spend $50 in production if you had 10 units of labor, and no units of capital."
"Or five units of capital, and no units of labor, or any combination in between."
These are all the combinations of labor and capital that cost $50.
"Likewise, the $100 isocost is all combinations of labor and capital that cost $100."
So each of these isocosts give you the combination of inputs that cost a certain amount.
Just like a budget constraint gave you the combination of pizza and movies on which you spent your income.
"Now, you may have said well, wait a second, the difference with consumers is we knew their income so we knew what their budget constraint is."
"Here we don't know whether to choose the $50 cost, the $100 cost, $150."
We don't know what the total amount is.
"That's what makes firms hard, that's why we have an extra step."
"So hold that thought, we'll come back to that next lecture."
"For now, let's just say there's a set of trade-offs that the firm can choose from, and a set of isoquants that they have."
And what's the slope of this isocost line?
It's the negative of the wage rental ratio.
The slope of the isocost is minus w over r.
The slope is minus w over r.
"It's basically the trade-off between labor and capital's going to be determined by the relative prices of those inputs, so slope is going to be minus w over r."
"So basically, how many units of capital do you have to give up to get the next unit of labor?"
"Well, what this isocost tells you is you have to give up 1/2 a unit of capital to get a unit of labor."
So the slope is minus 1/2.
"Likewise, you could say you have to give up two units of"
labor to get one unit of capital.
"So that's why the slope is minus 1/2, that's what it's telling us."
"Once again, budget constraints are about opportunity costs."

I started working with a boy who had just got expelled from school.
He had an interest in computers and at my office I noticed that there was a few lying around that nobody was using.
I got it to this kid and it completely turned things around for him.
Since that time we have been able to help thousands of people.
Eighty percent of the people that get a computer system from us have never had one before.
It's the ability to do a job search.
It's the ability to write a resume.
It's the ability to have access to the internet.
"By donating their equipment, local businesses and individuals get to be a part of that."
So many times a business or organization will spend thousands of dollars to get rid of their computer equipment.
For us we pick it up at no charge.
All those chemicals don't end up polluting the environment and the best part of being it gets to someone whos never had anything.
As this program has evolved we have established relationships with local colleges.
"Its a good learning experience for student interns, and work study students and service learning students."
The mission of PCs for people is pretty simple.
We basically try to help provide some hope and opportunity for people.
I think it is important for people to have the opportunity that everyone else has.
It's the right thing to do.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.
So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place.
It is the tenths place.
So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
And he said she was.

"The best time to cry is at night when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help,"
"Hello, everyone."
"I'm Amanda D'Annucci and I'm going  to be talking to you about storytelling, conflict resolution,  psychology and neuroscience."
"Did you know that  by telling someone a story, instead of spewing out  a mouthful of data, that you can engage a much larger  portion of their brain?"
The art of storytelling has psychological  and neurological basis that scientifically explains the natural human predilection for narrative.
"A vast portion of a person's brain is activated during the listening to, and telling of a story"
"For instance, the amygdala hippocampus system, which is responsible  for preliminary encoding of episodic and autobiographic memories is engaged; the left perisylvian region where language is created is engaged; and also, it has been proven  that the same sections of the brain lights up when the storyteller or the respective listener interacts."
"Quite simply, narrative engages the entire human brain, the entire human experience."
"If a string of word can affect a person in such a profound way, how powerful can the art of story be?"
"Stories can heal, stories can teach, stories can inspire, stories can enlighten stories can resolve."
"For my master thesis here at Gallatin,"
I'm exploring the power of story and relation to conflict resolution  and peace making.
Story is an influential tool which  can mold the most obstinate of minds by means of appealing  to an individual's pathos.
"By using story as a communication tool, a pessimist understanding can be  made into a relatable situation."
There's an ample evidence of storytelling  in a multitude of cultures around mankind.
Can you get enough players?
Can you get enough of the pieces to go?
"And if you offer a sufficiently compelling value proposition and a real differentiator, these things can grow big very quickly."
"I think the lesson of the Internet is that new businesses can grow very, very quickly when you get just the right combination of things and you get scale. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"And in the mobile internet, we have it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Yeah.
We clearly have had that this year.
"And, by the way, we've been waiting for years, so we've talked about this for a long time."
"So, again, in the â€˜What's New,' I think it's finally there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Who would've thought that the best signet that could've ever happened to the mobile Internet is that the growth was constrained by the carriers in their decks for so long and that it would happen to get traction at the time when the economy was very tough? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"And one of the interesting things about the carriers is the carriers are looking for new sources of data revenue and, you know, you asked earlier about the netbooks?"
"Some of the carriers are saying, ""Well, why don't we subsidize all of these different kinds of devices in the same way that they do with mobile phones today?"" Everybody understands the mobile phone plans, and they're subsidized, and so forth, to get those things out of there."
"And, again, that's another new thing that I think will serve as an accelerant to an already exciting industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Any questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thanks.
Greg sort of crossed specific capital.
Mary mentioned Japan as really leading in the mobile Internet.
And I wanted to understand what you're optimistic about in terms of other countries that are coming along.
Certainly it's not this country.
"But other countries that you think would follow the footsteps of Japan with mobile advertising, other revenue?"
Second question is what is your venture capital and M&amp;amp;A strategy going forward? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"With Japan, we have now partnerships, I think, with two of the three, or the three, depending on exactly how you define the leading mobile providers."
And the monetization is excellent.
"And so when you get it right, when you have the right ad product and the right search product on the right device and, of course, Japan, the products themselves are all different."
"Anyone who has spent their, tried to get your own phone to work on their networks, so we know that as a proof point."
And that's been true for a couple of years.
"So, we're now attempting to replicate those kinds of deals."
The obvious prize will be China because of the simple volume there.
"There's enough growth in CPMs and, basically, application use and wireless data networks in China that that's sort of the next really, really big one."
"The penetration for mobile devices in Europe is very strong, but the economies are not so strong."
We'll wait and see what happens there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
You mentioned-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We got from here that the source of the paradox is the simultaneity issue in the Garage's frame.
Indeed the ladder is contained in the garage.
In the
"ladder's frame, this never happens and the reason is that simultaneity is relative, and because the ladder is moving, the relativity of simultaneity means that at the same time, that say, the left hand entered the garage, in the ladder's frame the right hand was already out, okay?"
"So, what's our graphic representation?"
"Well here's our graphic representation, this is already familiar."
"I was here careful to remind myself that I'm plotting CT, so the red line that goes off at 45 degrees is the world line of a light beam."
"You don't need a light beam here, but it helps me to draw the t prime, CT prime and x prime axis so that the light cone bisects them."
"And what I have here, these two black lines to represent the garage These two blue lines represent the world lines."
X prime equal to zero is the T prime axis.
And x prime equals to L is the bold line of the right side of the garage and so this point here is X prime equal to L and.
"Both sides of the garage are moving, of the ladder are moving."
Both sides of the garage are stationary.
"I may have called the ladder a garage, but hopefully you understand what I am saying by now, and you're used to my ambiguity."
A word on scales in these diag rams and a very important point.
"So, suppose that I were to draw a grid of lines so these are lines of constant t, these are lines of constant x and some units so these are, and, and"
I've picked the unit so they are compatible.
"In other words, that if in some units this is one, two, three, four so my garage in this case is precisely four units long."
"Then CT is also one, two, three, four and you can see that because these, these things intersect the 45 degree."
Light count.
And so I've drawn these.
"How do I draw the point, t prime = to one?"
Where along the t prime axis is t prime = to one? and one way to think about it.
"One, naive way, is to just measure this same length along this axis."
"And because it is, The axis is, is, not vertical."
That would lead you to some point.
Around here and you'd maybe try to set that as t prime equals the one and that would be incorrect.
"The point is that the distance along this axis, in general, distances in this 2-dimensional plot are completely meaningless. well, how do you measure distances?"
"Well, the distance is this, between any two points."
"Is the square root of the difference in x squared, the horizontal difference, plus the vertical difference squared."
"That's, the Pythagorean Theorem which applies very well to the Euclidean surface of this A tablet upon which I am drawing it or to this Euclidean surface of this slide, but this is not a physical quantity."
"In particular, there is no reason why it isn't all related to x prime squared plus c^2 t prime squared."
"Essentially, we think that the slow diffusion of computers, which people were predicting should increase productivity as way back as the 1980s, suddenly in the 1990s it really happened."
And this IT revolution led to a big productivity increase.
"It's not clear if that's dying down now again, or if it's going to continue."
It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next 15 years.
"So we have this period of high productivity growth, slowed down from '73 to the early '90s and then picked up again."
"We're not quite clear if that year's coming to an end or not, but that's sort of where we are now in that time path."
"What's very interesting-- so that's what happens to productivity, that's all I'll talk about it for this course, it's more of a macro topic."
But I will mention an interesting micro spin on that.
"Which is, if society's more productive, that's like found money for society."
That's like saying with all our resources we suddenly get extra money.
Society then has to decide what to do with that.
The US and Europe have followed very different paths in what to do with that money.
"In the US, we've taken that money and bought a lot more stuff."
We have the highest standard of living in the world.
We buy the most stuff per capita of anyone the world.
"In Europe, they took a lot of that money and took more"
leisure with it.
"They decided we're not going to quite have as much stuff, but we're going to have six weeks a year of vacation instead of two weeks a year of vacation."
So if we go back to our discussion of what determines
"labor supply is the choice between leisure and consumption, and you think of the wage as the opportunity cost of leisure, well, what they've decided in Europe is to choose more along the leisure axis, and less along the consumption axis."
"In the US, we've chosen less among the leisure axis-- we work way harder than Europe-- but we have more stuff."
"And the question is, how do we feel about that choice?"
Has that been ultimately a welfare maximizing choice?
"Now an economist will say of course it's been, because it's a choice we made."
"Of course, it's been welfare maximizing."
"We talk about revealed preference, and people's choices reveal what they prefer."
"So our revealed preference, we just prefer stuff more and"
leisure less than Europe.
"But in fact, it's not clear that that is each individual's optimal choice."
"If a given individual says, look, I'd rather have less stuff and more time off, it may be hard to find the job that lets them do that."
"So while that may be the choice we've made as a society with our social institutions, that may not serve the interests of every individual in society."
And that's the kind of trade-off we need to think about.
"I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics."
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.
"Whereas I'm a field person,"
I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
Take me away.
So we can work with geneticists who understand that.
"So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks, they found that the diversity was incredibly low."
"If you look at the first line, really, you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar."
I think this means they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry.
"But if you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents, you see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study, was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species."
You can see this work was only done in 2006.
"Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks."
We had no idea:
Did they distinguish into different populations?
Were there subpopulations?
"And that's very important if you want to know what the population size is, and the status of the animals."
"So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really."
"So he did another study using microsatellites, which is much more expensive, much more time-consuming, and to his surprise, came up with almost identical results."
"So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity."
"And it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity."
"And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the other plankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater."
So it doesn't really make sense at all.
"They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks: even though they're found throughout the world, you couldn't tell the difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa."
They all basically seem the same.
"Which, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that."
I don't understand or pretend to understand this;
"I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers."
So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics.
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
"8,200 animals."
"That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world."
"You're thinking, ""That's ridiculous."
"The eyes, the jaw, the teeth: everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has."
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer.
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
"We went through this process, then, called retargeting."
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
"And here's the resulting data that comes from that, the model that comes from that."
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model.
"And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin was made from Brad, we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87."
"So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s."
Next we had to go into the shooting process.
"So while all that's going on, we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world."
"And we shot our body actors, and we shot them wearing blue hoods."
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
"And the blue hoods helped us with two things: one, we could easily erase their heads; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set."
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen.
"His job, then, was to become Benjamin."
And so we looped the scenes.
He watched again and again.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go.
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast.
From there we went into a process called image analysis.
"And so here, you can see again, the chosen take."
"And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87."
"And so, what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis, which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face."
"And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow."
"And the software would tell us that, well, in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here, and it concludes moving in frame 32."
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from.
"And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin, the FACS shapes that we had."
"On a frame-by-frame basis, we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad."
This is important because information persists but it's important to have information on the life cycle and it's important to have proper destruction policies.
I remember working for a company that was dealing with sensitive information a number of years ago.
And.
"They were, discarding PC's, and not zeroing out hard drives."
You may have seen a number of television documentaries or have read about instances where sensitive hard drives have ended up in the hands of the wrong people.
Even when we see issues of dumping technology.
In other countries.
"Loan of equipment or donation of, of aged equipment."
"There are markets for tech savvy folks in countries like that for hard drives that have not been erased, and may have sensitive information."
And then of course you want to give consideration to firing or termination processes.
"You need to have procedures, you need to know how you're going to separate somebody."
And how to deal with disgruntled employees.
Because therein lie seeds of dissatisfaction that might cause people to do damage to corporate information or to steal information that is sensitive.
So I'd like to refer you to special publication NlST-850.
That clearly recognizes the people factor as the weakest link.
And this is a standard that talks about effective security awareness training.
While this is a.
An equal module in the model that I've been using to describe information assurance in organizations.
"To you, this term, it's often an overlooked aspect of the information planning process."
So it's important to note that to be effective.
"An awareness event or, or training program should be designed to a specific audience."
"You wouldn't want to deliver the same training to a technical audience that you would give to general staff, for example."
And you want to be certain that you build the training around a clear message.
And that you have specific outcomes in mind.
This is good pedagogy regardless.
But it's specifically true with security and awareness training.
Because employees are saturated by company messages all of the time.
"And you don't want the reaction, oh well here they come again."
You really want to have a clear message.
"And you, you want to understand what outcomes you want."
And you want to get their attention.
So they don't think this is just another flavor of the week.

Because you want to leave all the wax on the car.
"In this particular case, you actually want to use dish soap, because it removes all the wax, and then you can actually see what's going on in the paint."
"Stripping the wax is essential for paint correction and requires a little more than switching from soft car soap to strong dish soap, and of course, following the same steps as you normally would when cleaning your car."
Add a few squirts of dish soap to your clean wash bucket and/or foam gun.
Then rinse down the paint with hose water to remove the loose dirt.
"Next, use the foam gun or the wash mitt to apply the dish soap that will emulsify the wax, uncovering the paint beneath it."
"Once the car is completely washed, use your clay bar, along with the wash mitt and the dish soap as a"
"lubrication, and remove any contaminants that may remain embedded in the paint after the initial cleaning."
"Now, we can be sure the surface is uncovered, or what we call naked paint, so that we can see how bad the scratches really are without waxes or silicones hiding them."
"Now, that the car's been stripped, what I like to do is use my crazy tools here to inspect the paint at the microscopic level."
"What that does is it shows me what's going on and how bad the paint is, and it helps me approach it and fix it or repair it in the best and fastest way."
"Mind you, these may not be necessary for the weekend warrior, but I still think they're pretty cool."
All right.
"So the first thing I have here is an assortment of lights, and my favorite one is this Brinkmann Dual Xenon light."
"Now, what I do, is I use it by shining it right here on the quarter panel, and I can see any of the swirls that are present."
"Remember, we removed all the wax, so what I'm seeing is actually there."
This is a great tool for visualizing how bad the damage is.
The second little tool I like to use is my infrared thermometer.
"Now, what I do is I shine it at the paint."
"Right now, it's telling me it's 83.5 degrees."
"Now, anything under 100 degrees is usable, meaning I can actually work on the paint here."
"If it's above 100 degrees, it's too hot for me."
"So I'll let it cool down, or I'll put some water on it, or"
I'll pull it inside the garage.
"Now, the reason why you want it so cool is the products happen to flash, meaning they burn up too fast, and it reduces the rate of abrasion that you can use to fix the paint."
So this is a very useful tool to figure out what temperature you're at.
"Now, the most useful tool I have is the PosiTector paint depth gauge."
Now come up with a catchy name so we know what to call it

With functional coverage we can describe critical conditions that we have to meet to sign off our chip.
Therefore we have to do a very good job.
We cannot just wing it.
We have to be diligent about it.
This means we will do a planning process.
It will involve all the critical stakeholders in that development project.
People that write the verification environment.
"People that write the chip model, and the chip architects, and all of these people, come together and specify what conditions need to be met."
"We're also looking at documents like the specification document, and we consult from the experiences of the past projects."
"With all of this together we write down our plan, and then we establish and implement our coverage scores."
GROWing together....
Growing a better future...
What is GROW?
The GROW campaign is a global effort aimed at addressing the broken food system.
The movement aims to put food on the table for the 1 billion people who go to bed hungry.
These people have little or no access to resources needed to produce food ... or they have no money to buy food at all.
"The GROW movement pushes for better policies on agriculture, the environment ... and bring back the control over food production from the big agribusinesses ... to the hands of small farmers, fisherfolks, rural women and indigenous peoples."
Why join GROW?
"In Southeast Asia, such movement is crucial."
"Here, 6 out of 10 people go to bed hungry."
"Majority of them are farmers, rural women, fisherfolks, and indigenous peoples."
They are also the planet's main food producers.
Women do both productive and reproductive work and make up half of the rural labor force.
"But women have less access than men to resources and opportunities ... such as land, livestock, wages, education, financial services, and access to technology."
Other problems are making the situation worse.
Land grabs are endangering the region's food security.
Small scale farmers are pushed off their land by private sector investments in agriculture.
Southeast Asian countries are among the biggest destinations of such investments.
Extreme weather changes brought about by climate change is causing floods and droughts.
"And that's called an affordance, and that's not just in the real world, but also in the physical world."
All these various widgets have these physical properties that are baked into their visual design.
"When you look at one of these, you can very quickly infer how you are going to interact with it because of those properties."
"The way that the circle's slightly larger makes it seem grabbable, the way that it's brighter on one side implies that it's been sort of filled so it feels like a track that you can grab this thing and move it on."
"Seeing a check box, a square in the presence of one that has a check box, is going to convey that that one could also have a check box."
"On and off, literally writing it on the switch is going more towards the direction of writing your manual on top of it, but the visual design conveys what it does, the same with the button."
So these are all affordances.
"Basically, an affordance is implied physics from the visual appearance."
"Moving on to the third one, natural mapping."
So let's run a quick experiment on the audience.
Say we're looking at a stove.
"So the second dial, which burner does it control?"
"And silence, you don't know, because there's no way to figure it out."
"We could literally write the glyphs on top of it, that would help."
"But the thing is, writing your manual directly on the product is cheating."
Then what if it wears off?
"That's definitely one way of doing it, but it's not a natural mapping."
"A better Ul, and this is something that Alan Cooper"
"likes to talk about, is if the dials were in that same configuration as four things, then it just naturally affords which burner they control."
This is also always true of light switches.
"So light switches only are frustrating when they don't actually map in order to the lights in the room, and if they do map in order, you usually just flip the right one without even thinking about it."
"If they don't, then you start randomly hitting them to try to figure it out and getting frustrated."
So this is a natural mapping.
"Another example, controls in a car."
"I love this one, because it's actually two natural mappings at the same time."
"The first is it's directly below the window, so it's a sort of natural orientation to where the window is, and also the four controls map to the four windows in the car."
"Sometimes, these are placed on the center console, which is really weird."
So that's in the physical world.
"In terms of the virtual world, we have things like this where the Full Screen control has a natural mapping to the window becoming larger."
It's placed on the edge.
It seems to afford expanding.
"In this case, the Account Selector has a mapping to the window, because the account controls the window as a whole, not an individual tab."
"Now when my mother died and I had grief, it wasn't a negative emotion."
"Out of my grief came hope and inspiration, determination and respect and all those things you talked about."
"And when a loved one dies and we have grief, I think, I put it to you that we have grief because we have a connection, it's the spirit connection within us - it's that God part in us that connects with the"
God part of that other person.
So therefore it's the passing of the spirit.
That when we have grief over death it's about the passing of that spirit which we accept.
"So I put it to you that grief is not a negative emotion but it's intrinsic in the emotion of love because out of love comes joy and peace and patience and kindness, gentleness, prayerfulness, goodness and understanding and self-control."
"Now, in close, if you made a comment I'd appreciate it."
"But I've noticed that you've mentioned John Howard, now I respect John Howard because firstly as a father, he's been a great father, I'm a father, and secondly he's been a magnificent"
"leader to this nation for a long period of time, so I think we should respect him for who he is."
Ajahn Brahm:
I agree with you with respect yes.
"Okay, it's a long question there and usually I try to repeat this for the tape but that was too long a question to repeat it for and wouldn't actually catch it but the first thing, I'm just going to do this in brief."
The main question was about - is grief intrinsic to love?
"And I certainly thought that way when I was very young, but I know that I never had grief when my father died but I loved him very dearly."
"I couldn't understand why that was, and only later on when I went to Buddhist countries and spent nine years in the north-east of Thailand which unlike"
"Sri Lanka had not been, I would say influenced by ""Western"" civilisation."
"The West had never got to Thailand, or rather they never had colonised it."
"And so it was, what I could actually possibly call a pure Buddhist culture there."
And in the nine years I was there I never saw grief.
"And this was living in a village very close to those people, we were part of the family, and many times I saw people die."
The funerals were held in our monastery.
I never saw tears.
It wasn't part of their repertoire.
That proved to me was that grief is not intrinsic in the human condition.
There was a culture which didn't have it.
And it wasn't just the funerals.
"You'd see them afterwards, the next day, weeks, months, they were part of your family, the extended family of a monastery embedded in a couple of villages in the north-east of"
Thailand.
"And those people loved each other, but there is a another type of love, which is a love which will let go.."
Which will let a person go into a death.
"So grief is, and we're not saying that grief is wrong or bad."
"Not just ""kind of"", it's actually joining our ancestor as its being created and extending that relationship by joining with another instance of parent."
So you can kind of think of going down the ancestor tree adding relationships as we go down.
"Again, I really can't encourage you enough to download this query and play with it yourself to fully understand what's going on."
Let's go ahead and run it.
It's going to be rather anticlimatic.
"When we run it we do discover that these five people are Mary's ancestors, and if you've drawn the little tree of the data you can verify that, that's the correct answer."
Let's play around a little bit.
Let me try a few other people's ancestors.
Let's try Frank.
We don't see Frank here because
"Frank actually happens to be a child of Mary's, so we should get even more ancestors when we run this one, especially"
"Mary should be included, and in fact, she is, there she is, and these are Frank's ancestors."
"Let's try George, I think"
George was somewhere in the middle of the tree there.
"Yes, George has three ancestors, and finally let's try Bob."
"Bob is at the root so we should get an empty result and we do, because again Bob has no ancestors in our database."
Now lets take a look at our second example.
"That was the one where we had a hierarchy of management chain in a company, and then we were interested in computing the total salary cost of a project, so I've set up our three tables."
"The first one is the Employee table, it just gives the IDs of the employees and the salary of each employee."
The second table is the Manager relationship.
"So, again, you might want to draw the little tree here although it's pretty simple this time."
"123 is at the root of our little management structure, as 234 as a subordinate."
"234 has two subordinates, 345 and 456 and 345 is another one."
So it's only a three level tree.
Of course if we knew it was only three levels we wouldn't need recursion at all.
But we're going to write a query that will work for arbitrary numbers of levels.
So that's our management structure.
"And finally, our third table, the Project table says that employee 123 is the manager of project X, so what we want to do is find the manager of project"
"Y in the hierarchy,and then take that manager's salary along with the salary's of all the manager's subordinates recursively down to the management structure, and of course that's everybody in in our little database."
"Again, I can't encourage you to download the script and run it for yourself."
So here's our query to find the total salary of project x and I'm actually going to give a couple of different ways of running this for you.
The way we've done it the first time is to effectively expand the management structure into a relation called superior.
And desire this public
"Notice may be given of their Resolution, so their Parents and Friends may have sufficient Time to be providing Homespun Cloaths for them."""
[laughter]
It was like: 'we are making a proclamation.
"Mom, send me some clothes.'"
[laughter]
That was like--okay.
[laughs]
But the feeling was there.
[laughs]
"And even better, they want their parents to provide homespun clothes,"
"""that none of them may be obliged to the hard Necessity of unfashionable Singularity, by wearing imported Cloth."""
Okay.
"'Mom, if you don't send me clothes,"
I'm going to have to wear imported clothes and I'm going to be really unpopular'-- so--[laughter] guilting the parents.
"Okay, but anyway that's--Yale students of the 1760s actually making acts of protest, organizing themselves into active protest."
"Now Yale isn't unique in this way, actually."
"Throughout the--this period, colonial colleges in a variety of different places were places that tended to brew sentiment-- political sentiment that was rebellious or outraged at some of the acts being imposed by the British government."
"Actually, Yale and Harvard and the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton, tended to be particularly well-known as sort of seedbeds of unrest-- particularly angry students who had strong political feelings, but there were other colleges as well where the students really were provoked to acts of protest in a variety of different ways."
"And I--this morning in researching for this lecture,"
I found a bunch of Princeton/College of New Jersey students who decided that no one in Princeton should be drinking tea.
So they went out into the town and just personally forced their way in to people's houses and when they found tea they burned it.
"That would be really popular--right?--and then one of them said something like, ""That was a real frolic."""
[laughter]
Okay.
[laughs]
The town must have been very pleased.
"I think in another college the commencement exercises, the speeches that the students gave at a commencement exercise, at a pretty early point actually, they debated, one for, one and against the possibility of independence."
I think that was in 1769.
You had students at one college who decided that would be what would be happening at their commencement ceremony is they would have that debate.
"It's a really early point and again, pretty radical."
"So we're kind of looking at a long-standing pattern of college students being bold and radical during times of political controversy and political unrest, and this is happening throughout the colonies in this period."
"Evidently we didn't know what was going to happen on the 16th, but by the 15th we had to be deployed in different cities of Spain, as we did."
We were clear about this.
So to us this was something natural.
We worked there because this was something important to us.
Evidently it was important because we empathized with some of the demands that were on the table.
ST:
"Maybe due to your preparation, or your perspective, the fact that you weren't caught by surprise, comes the situation that you, personally, and your media outlet was directly associated with the 15M."
"And you are a sort of medial outlet part of 15M or something like that, no?"
JL:
To inform about 15M does not mean TO BE PART of 15M.
In the same way that a journalist on the mainstream media who informs daily about the PP is not part of PP or a person who informs daily about the PSOE is not part of PSOE.
Or a person who informs daily about the NGOs is not a member of an NGO.
That's obvious to me.
"Now, I have no problem admitting that I empathize with many of the things that were happening on that square, no problem at all."
"Not one, because among another million things in which I don't believe, I don't believe in keeping my distance or in being extra careful in dealing with something."
"Firstly, being part of the 15M is very complicated because it's nothing."
"I have to insist, 15M is a diagnosis."
You can share certain parts of the diagnosis.
Each person's solutions are completely different.
"And being part of something... for the journalists who were at the Puerta del Sol not only those of Periodismo Humano, but also many other mainstream media corporations who had their journalists there, for those journalists- not the corporations- I think that the defence mechanism of warning that they were there doing their job and were not part of it, is the same defence mechanism used by the 15M as a general rule when someone asked them if they're left or right-wing."
Then the 15M said:
"""Wait, you don't understand... what I do in the street isn't that, it's different""."
"And the journalists who were in the 15M were informing on what we saw, but to say that we're part of the 15M as many have said indicates that they don't understand what the 15M is because you can't be a militant of the 15M."
You can't.
"And secondly, a lack of respect towards our work as journalists."
"Not towards those of Periodismo Humano, but towards those from Punto Radio and La Sexta, towards those from 20minutos and TVE..."
"Many people who were there informing about the 15M in their own way, maybe in personal networks and not through more institutional channels for whatever reason."
ST:
"Let's continue with journalism, which I was saving for later but since we're on the topic..."
"I'd like you to tell me first how you think the movement, the #15M and the camps have been treated in the media, generally speaking."
JL:
I think there were various phases in the media treatment of #15M.
"But he showed incredible bravery, incredible courage at bringing the nation together, forging a courageous spirit, taking on Hitler, and eventually winning."
"So it was a very difficult time for Britain, a time when you needed the best possible leader, the most courageous possible leader to come forward, and in Winston Churchill we were incredibly fortunate to have that man."

Steven:
"When historians talk about late 19th-century Paris, they often talk about a culture of display, and this is a painting that is all about that."
Beth:
"We're looking at Mary Cassatt's painting,"
"Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge, and this is, perhaps, Mary Cassatt's sister pictured in the Paris opera house."
"She's sitting in a private booth, and we can see behind her a mirror, which reflects all the other private booths in the opera house."
Steven:
"So the Paris opera house, situated at the intersection of the Grand Boulevards, is a building which is a kind of jewel itself, but that also puts its occupants on display."
"In other words, the stage of the opera house is not simply where the ballet takes place, but the stage is also the audience."
Beth:
"The architecture of the Paris opera house enabled seeing and being seen, and afforded numerous opportunities in small, little balconies and spaces where one could glimpse the fashionable elite of Paris, and we certainly feel that we're looking at one of the members of that elite in this painting by Mary Cassatt."
Steven:
What you said is exactly right.
Look at the composition.
Mary Cassatt must have been turned away from the stage
"looking into the box towards her sister, and Lydia is, in turn, looking back out towards the audience, and so we're seeing Lydia the way that the audience would have seen her, had they glanced into this box."
She is this object of display within this jewel box.
Beth:
"But Cassatt doesn't paint herself reflected in the mirror, where she must have been as she looked at Lydia and painted her."
But it will come.
You can be sure of that.
"That means, today is not tomorrow yet?"
Today - is today.
And tomorrow will be tomorrow.
Every day?
Every day.
That's wonderful!
Every day will be tomorrow!
The End Subbed by Eus
"My beloved brothers and sisters, as we gather once again in a general conference of the Church,"
I welcome you and express my love to you.
"We meet each six months to strengthen one another, to extend encouragement, to provide comfort, to build faith."
We are here to learn.
Some of you may be seeking answers to questions and challenges you are experiencing in your life.
Some are struggling with disappointments or losses.
Each can be enlightened and uplifted and comforted as the Spirit of the Lord is felt.
"Should there be changes which need to be made in your life, may you find the incentive and the courage to do so as you listen to the inspired words which will be spoken."
May each of us resolve anew to live so that we are worthy sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.
May we continue to oppose evil wherever it is found.
How blessed we are to have come to earth at such a time as this —a marvelous time in the long history of the world.
"We can't all be together under one roof, but we now have the ability to partake of the proceedings of this conference through the wonders of television, radio, cable, satellite transmission, and the Internet —even on mobile devices."
"We come together as one, speaking many languages,"
"living in many lands, but all of one faith and one doctrine and one purpose."
"From a small beginning 182 years ago, our presence is now felt throughout the world."
"This great cause in which we are engaged will continue to go forth, changing and blessing lives as it does so."
"No cause, no force in the entire world can stop the work of God."
"Despite what comes, this great cause will go forward."
You recall the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:
"""No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done."""
"There is much that is difficult and challenging in the world today, my brothers and sisters, but there is also much that is good and uplifting."
"As we declare in our thirteenth article of faith,"
"But, in unison, we are celebrating the life of my Dad."
"My first friend, the best man at my wedding, and an individual that set the bar when describing a true ""family man."""
"Being a simple person, it didn't take much to please our Dad"
"After he served 8 years in the U.S. Navy,"
"Dad often wore a hat in public, with an image and the name of battleship on which he served."
"Should someone recognize him as a veteran and thank him for serving,"
Dad would beam with pride.
"The word ""handy"" and our dad, were never used in the same sentence."
"His most exhaustive chore, just might've been re-setting his dozens of clocks, in the spring and fall."
"Yet, incredibly until about the last year of his life, he maintained his tropical fish tanks with meticulous care."
Dad loved to make people laugh.
"Through his timeless and - often repeated - stories, to his quick-witted comments, to his juvenile behavior, intended solely to draw belly laughs from his grandchildren and great-grandchildren that he adored."
Many of you here today experienced those fun-loving times with us while in our Dad's presence.
"And at this point I would be remiss to not formally thank so many people as we close this chapter of our lives that included Dad in our physical presence but, with your help we will continue to re-live so many wonderful memories until the day we are called, and that the faith we hold that our Dad nurtured, we will see him and the other loved ones we lost once again."
"We thank you - his sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters-in-law."
"Nieces, nephews, cousins, former co-workers, family friends, neighbors for all of your comforting words and support."
"Your visits, the food you have prepared for our family."
"We're grateful to have you in our lives, and have you be a part of our Dad's."
"I'd also like to thank Father Steve, for leading our service."
"Outside of perhaps a certain individual who resides at the Vatican,"
I know my dad would prefer no one else presiding here today.
To my sisters...
"Chris, Theresa, Karen and Donna."
Each of you and your own unique ways brought so much happiness into dad's life.
Chris your selfless love and cheery disposition engulfed Dad.
You always made the time for what ever was needed without complaint.
I'm convinced that no one in this world has a bigger heart than you.
"Theresa,"
"My sister with a tough exterior, originating, perhaps, from her delivery by dad in a bar."
"But someone who displays a soft spot at the moments of her choice that is welcome by those, like my parents, on the receiving end."
"On many occasions, even during your own life's challenges"
"Mom and Dad would share stories with me of your visit or phone call and rave how your carefree attitude and laughed would bring cheer to them when, at certain moments, the roles should have been reversed."
I think is a shame.
I would like this to be in the language -- or would have liked it to be in the language -- for two reasons.
One is the loop affordances it provides expect you're always going to exit either at the top or the bottom of the loop.
"I don't know if it's something weird about me, but I tend to exit out of the middle more often than"
I exit out of either end.
[laughter]
You can do that.
"Just say 'while true', which just looks stupid."
This is the more elemental thing.
The other is that it makes it easier to think about the language.
If this were the primitive loop statement and all of the others were simply variations on that then the language in its core would be smaller and easier to reason about.
"So when you're thinking about the language's security, you have less analysis to do."
I think that would be a useful thing.
"For example, we can take a while statement and de-sugar it into a simple loop statement."
You can see by the amount of de-sugaring it does that the while statement really isn't buying us very much.
We can do a similar thing with the do while statement.
"It's sort of interesting: while the 'do while' looks very different than the 'while' statement, what it does is actually almost identical."
The only difference is that it put the test on one end rather than on the other.
"Then when you look at what the 'for' statement actually does, it really doesn't do anything at all."
It just is complicated.
"Another way that you could think about doing iteration, another way of doing a loop, would be to use recursion."
"Another way that we could have transformed the while statement would be to turn it into a function which calls itself, and continues to call itself as long as the condition is true, with two restrictions."
"One is that because of the way functions work in JavaScript, you can't take any arbitrary code and put it inside of a body here."
"Arguments, this, break statements and return statements, the meanings of all of those change when you put them into a function, so you can't put them in the body here."
The other — more important — thing is that JavaScript does not implement tail recursion optimization
-- what people call proper tail calls.
"You can run for a while, and then it's going to start to slow down as it accumulates memory, and eventually it's going to fail."
You don't
like it when programs fail.
"I'm hoping that maybe someday in the distant future JavaScript would be enhanced to allow this, but it doesn't yet."
But that's not the kind of loop that I'm here to talk about tonight.
"I'm here to talk about event loops, because event loops are much more interesting."
"That means the quantity of tickets available is going to be ten, the quantity of Tickets or pollution rights demanded is going to be 25, there is a serious shortage in the market and in an auction that shortage is going to be solved by an elevation of the rights."
If the price of one of these tickets goes to $150 then you can imagine that A. will only buy four rights.
Why?
"Because A would prefer to incurr the $100 cost of abating the first unit of pollution than to pay, to pay $150 for a right to pol-."
To pollute or to emit that unit of pollution.
"So, the price, the quantity demanded of tickets is going to go down."
"As, the price at the auction goes up."
"As in all markets, there is going to be an equilibrium price for, these pollution rights."
"In thi s market on my document camera, we have the supply of pollution rights."
This vertical
line here.
There are ten of them.
Got it indicated there.
This demand curve is actually drawn from the earlier table.
"That is, I just, if the price goes up, I just ask how many. tickets would firms a, b, c, d and e, buy, and this is actually how it turns out."
"That is, as the price of the ticket goes up, the number of tickets demanded, goes, goes down, goes down to zero at $5600."
"Well, the equilibrium price."
Is going to be the intersection price and supply demand intersect at 1500 dollars.
Now suppose that the government decides to auction off these rights and the equilibrium price is 1500 dollars as we've indicated from our graphical analysis and then we ask the issue how many. tickets or pollution rights with each of these firms obey.
While A would prefer to clean up the first unit of pollution at a cost of a $100 and had to go by a pollution right and would enable it to avoid clean up.
"It would prefer to but. clean up the second one and the third one and the fourth one, but it would prefer to buy a pollution right at 1500 than to incur $1600 in costs."
So A is going to buy one pollution right.
"B, on the other hand, would prefer to clean up these first two units, incur those costs as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning them up, so B Is going to want to buy, three pollution rights. c is going to want to buy none of, none of the pollution rights, and the reason is that it's cost of clean up is, is lower for each of these units, than the $1,500 ticket price, so c Is going to have zero tickets, quantity demanded."
"D, is going to want to buy two tickets."
Why?
"Because it is cheaper to buy a ticket for 1,500, than to incur a pollution cost, abatement cost of 1,800 or 2,200."
"So D is going to buy two rights, and E is going to buy four rights."
"The reason is, it will clean up the first unit at $1000 as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning it up."
"It is cheaper to buy the rights here, so we have a situation here in which A. Is when a by one right D three, C0, D2, and A4."
"Well, at the end those up one, three, four, six, ten."
Quantity demanded is equal to ten.
Now we know where the distribution is.
"Normally, the first sound is slightly lower in pitch in comparison with the second sound."
"[normal first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2]"
Thank you.
Good morning.
We came here to do a presentation a bit more academic than the other two.
"Lorenzo Escot and I teach at the Complutense University of Madrid, and we have a research group that has spent years analyzing matters of gender equality, mostly in the labor market."
Our presentation is called:
"""Few women are directors because few men are caretakers""."
"Saying this, what we want is somehow, to address the question of why there is a presence so scarce of women, disappointingly, in the higher directive positions."
"After so many years, or so many decades of women having access to the labor market."
"For example, in companies listed in stock market, the IBEX-35, women in advising positions make up 8%."
"Their presence is still very low, and there are issues of permanence."
We wanted to address this type of issue but in a slightly different way.
"What we do is somehow go to the other side, why are there so few men who are caretakers."
"That is, men who have unpaid jobs, who work at home, taking care of kids, relatives, etc."
"Because we feel like, and the literature available proves it, that there is a high correlation."
"On the other hand, as we have been doing in our other two presentations, when we speak about gender matters, we're not speaking of women alone, we're talking about both women and men."
And they're interconnected.
"So the first point I'd like to deal with is, very briefly, what are the theories that explain why there still is a small presence of women in high positions in organizations."
One of the popular ones is the glass ceiling theory.
"""Glass ceiling"" refers to barriers, invisible barriers that limit the access of women to those higher positions within organizations."
I would also say that such barriers are external to women.
"And it has to do with matters such as, for example, not belonging to the networks or having the contacts that are necessary in order to plot."
One must plot to make it to the higher positions in an organization.
Maybe you need to play golf.
And women need to do certain things that they still do not normally do nowadays.
"For example, it also has to do with the lack of role models."
"This will disappear as time passes, but it's hard."
It's also related to stereotypes.
What are women good at?
What are men good at?
These are stereotypes related to social gender roles which have a great influence.
I'm going to try and get back out what was front most.
Okay.
"So queue is FlFO, first in first out, and waiting in line, whoever's been in the queue longest is the first one to come out, very fair handling of things."
And so if were to think about this in terms of let's go straight across the
linked list.
We just got our head around the link list with the stack.
Let's see if there's a link list for the queue provide the same kind of easy access to the things we need to do the work.
"So it seems like the two strategies that we looked at for stack are probably the same two to look at for this one, right, which we go in the front ways orders."
I mean the front of the queue accessible in there and reversing our way down to the tail or the other way around.
Right.
"I mean, the tail of the queue up here in the front"
leading the way to the head of the queue.
"So this is head - I'll call it front of queue, and this is back, this is the back and that's the front."
Okay.
So that will be GA that will be GB.
"But first off, ask yourself, where does the queue do its work?"
Does it do it at the front or does it do it at the back?
It does it at both.
"But when you're end queuing, right, you're manipulating the back of the queue, adding something to the tail end of the line."
"When you are de queuing, you're adding something to the front of the queue."
"So like unlike the stack where both the actions were happening in the same place, and that kind of unified your thinking about where to allow for that, you know, easy access to the top, the one thing the stack cared about, but the bottom of the stack, right, was, you know, buried and it didn't matter."
The queue actually needs accesses to both.
"So that sort of sounds like that both these strategies, right, have the potential to be trouble for us."
"Because it's like in the link list form, right, you know the idea that access to the head is easy, access to the tail that is a little bit more tricky."
"Now, I said we could add a tail pointer."
"And maybe that's actually going to be part of the answer to this, right, but as it is, with no head pointers in here, that adding an item to A would involve traversing that queue to find the end to put a new one on."
"Similarly, if indeed, the inverse operation is going to be our trouble, which is de queuing, we have to kind of walk its way down to find the last element in the link list ordering, which is [inaudible] queue."
So what say we add a tail pointer in both cases?
"So we have a head that points to here and a tail that points to there, it's"
like that will make our problem a little bit easier to deal with.
So
let me look at B first.
Every night!
"Something is seriously askew, and we should really talk about it."
"Right now, half of the total global wheat harvest is used as livestock feed to support our meat and dairy consumption."
"Half of the entire harvest, while, at the same time, people in poor countries are starving."
And there doesn't seem to be an end to this.
We keep on consuming more and more and more.
"And, in the future, we will have to exploit other people's natural resources even more than we do now."
"And this will be at the expense of those people, clean water, clean air and also our environment."
"So, let me sum this up for you."
Scientists say that it simply takes far more land and energy to produce animal protein than plant-based ones.
To produce animal products you need up to ten times as much land as is needed to produce vegetable products.
And this is due to the fact that all this land is needed to produce feed for these billions of farm animals.
Films like An Inconvenient Truth have made a very important contribution to the debate on global warming.
Yet the only cow that I saw on-screen symbolised little Al's picture-perfect youth in Tennessee.
In the whole Inconvenient Truth not a single word was said about
"livestock farming, or the impact of this polluting industry."
"Dr. Steinfeld, how is it possible that livestock doesn't play a role in the discussion about global warming?"
"Well, I think that the fact is that in the climate change discussion much of the focus is on carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide emissions if you look at the livestock sector only make up about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions."
"Nitrous oxides and methane don't come very strongly into the debate, but they are much more potent in terms of greenhouse gasses and carbon dioxide and they need to be factored in."
But Al Gore didn't say one single word about the livestock industry in his documentary.
What do you think?
Didn't you miss the aspect as well?
It is certainly missing; the entire aspect of food is missing.
And I think that everyone needs to know that food and agriculture contributes to climate change and has environmental impact.
"And that one needs to make choices, if one wants to be environmentally friendly, that are in line with the environmental impact of producing various types of food."
"Well, I think that he should have said something about it."
Have you ever tried to convince him?
"Well, I'm not someone who knows Al Gore personally."
"I think that at my level publishing results and talking at conferences, and talking to the media such as in this case is all I can do."
"Well, thank you."
He doesn't know it either.
"So, I went to the United States to find an answer to this question."
"I was teaching in Oakland, most recently, Oakland California, for the past three years at progressive school where the organization Mindful Schools started."
So I was in a really wonderful space  to be sharing the practice.
"And before that, I taught  at an international school in India where we had actually a group of educators that met weekly to share the practice."
"And in India I had this unique experience  of being an expat but obviously looking very Indian,  having an Indian name, and having Indian heritage but being the only teacher in the school that was of Indian heritage  but that was an American."
"And I had one student,  who was an adorable, sweet little boy."
I was running an academic program  and in the process of hiring an assistant.
"When I shared with this student  that I was hiring an assistant, this boy said, ""Is it going to be an Indian person?"""
"At that moment, I could just feel so much pain inside myself and really touching the face of having  felt discriminated against growing up and feeling like an outsider."
"Before the practice,  I probably would have said to him,"
"""That is unacceptable,  you can't say that""."
I would have reacted.
"But because of the practice,"
"I went to my breath,  I recognised what was coming up, and I was able to respond, not react."
"And asked him, ""Why would you not want to hire someone who's Indian?"
"Talk to me about that."""
I realized he didn't want to come to India but was there because of his father's job and he had difficulty  understanding the accents and it was nothing about me  being Indian.
"But here I am, immediately  going to that place."
I share that story because  it was really powerful moment for me where the practice made me realize... it helped me really develop compassion and understanding in myself  and not react.
Really look at my student  as another human being and not sort of teacher-student  relationship.
"I think sometimes mindfulness can be sold  like a gimmick, as stress reduction, increasing focus, increasing attention."
"But this path that we are on,  when you are practicing mindfulness it is about awakening,  it is about liberation, it is about dissolving those identities of teacher and student, really developing authentic relationship."
"At that moment, when I had  that interaction with this boy in my class"
I realized the power of the practice.
"When I share the practice with my students I do a lot of things with them, most recently teaching middle school,  I start every class by inviting the bell."
"Two things I can offer from what I learned with sharing the practice is to always frame it as an invitation, especially with young people."
I've never been dogmatic about it  but always frame it as an invitation.
Authenticity is so key.
"When you are being authentic, the kids are more up to really be present, to being engaged and be available."
"So, I'll start the class saying,"
"""Okay, our bodies are here  but where are our minds?"
"Our minds could still be at Math,  our minds could still be at lunch."
"Let's take a moment, invite the bell and come back to ourselves so we can be here."""
"I am English so I find claiming to be successful difficult, we are very self-deprecating."
But I was doing okay ( )
"Then I got a condition like lupus,  an autoimmune condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and I hope no one here ever gets it but if you do, it is similar, horribly painful."
I was just outraged at this.
I was in terrible pain and couldn't walk very well and my life was being very narrowed by this.
"My reaction to this was just to feel outraged, that my life was being spoiled in this way."
Actually ugly enough I became quite suicidal in a sort of way.
"What is the point of life, really?"
"You know, this is not right and  I became quite depressed about this and discovered mindfulness  which actually, to be serious about it, really did save my life and it gave me my life back."
I took early retirement from a job  that was driving me nuts and decided to re-train in mindfulness  at the University of Exeter.
"Now, my job before this was in social and emotional learning and I was training to  be a mindfulness instructor for adults."
"Suddenly, it occurred to me that there might be a link between mindfulness for adults and mindfulness for kids and social emotional learning."
I don't know what took me  so long to point that out.
"Then I started developing work on mindfulness in schools and discovered, of course, that there was a lot already happening."
"As it has been said, I got involved in a major program in United Kingdom which is a lovely program  called .b (dot-be)."
"I became involved  with the work of Thich Nhat Hanh, by muscling my way into a educators retreat in London."
"I was just a substitute to a person  who was supposed to turn up, so I kept hoping that he  would turn up and take over."
"Recently, I have been advising  the Mind and Life Institute where the Dalai Lama is developing a very similar initiative to Wake Up Schools."
"So, rather like your car driver, in a way"
I thank the condition I got.
It's strange really how life can turn out.
How suffering can turn  into something such good.
"Anyway, to stop talking about myself which we the English find very difficult,"
-you guys find it very easy  but we feel embarrassed by all these hard stuff- I'll get more pragmatic now.
"And in a sense just give you a few messages from what I guess,"
"I have gathered with working  with people in schools, particularly in Europe but across the world, really."
"I think it has been said many times but this is essentially about you, as teachers, educators and administrators."
"Just to add a thought to that, which  is to bring this kindness and compassion to yourself, including the bits where it doesn't work very well, where you are not as mindful  as you should be."
Because we really need not turn mindfulness into another ought.
"So if we don't practice,  we don't feel very guilty."
"I know some of the adults that I teach, when they stop practicing  for a while and get back into it, the first rumination they say is, ""Why I don't do this more often, it is awfully good for me, I am really  a bad person if I don't keep this up""."
"So, let's be kind to ourselves, including when we aren't as mindful as we should be."
You adjust.
And you just settle from I'd like him to graduate from college to I hope he graduates from high school.
"And then you change from well, I hope he graduates from high school to I hope he makes it."
You've seen kids that are in jail one day and the next year they're in college and doing great.
So he still has a shot at it.
I'm not saying it's all over for him.
You can't give up hope.
That's about all you do have is hope.
"Hope is what has motivated each of these families to share their stories tonight, hope that we can all learn from their experiences and realize that no child with learning problems has to become a lost child."
"It's a lesson that's been a long time coming, including to families like mine, that with the right diagnosis, the proper management, and lots of hard work and ongoing support, none of our children is beyond rescue."
There really are so many different ways to solve this problem called life.
"I mean, there really are."
"And if you look at successful people, nine times out of ten they will tell you of stories of tremendous struggle."
"If you've got a different kind of brain, and I submit the most interesting people do, that's great."
"And as you're remediating all this stuff and learning how to be on time and all this stuff that you got to learn how to do, never lose sight of those strengths, those talents, because that is what is going to take you to great places."

"I know the possibilities that our equipment has, and the capabilities that we can run with."
"The significance of Assata Shakur being put on the FBl's terrorists list, the first woman ever to be added to the most wanted list?"
LENNOX HlNDS:
"My view on this is that this is a disingenuous act on the part of, driven by the state of New Jersey and particularly the state police."
"As you know, for decades, the state police have wanted and demanded that the Cuban government extradite Assata Shakur to the United States."
There is no extradition policy between Cuba and the United States.
"Just to deal with this in context, the Cuban government, pursuant to international law— that is, particularly the refugee convention— have granted Assata Shakur political asylum."
"Now, what is the basis for that?"
"It is if an individual has a well-grounded fear that if they return to the country from which they left, they would either be persecuted or prosecuted based upon their political beliefs or/and their race or religion."
"Now, this is not a new concept."
"There have been numerous individuals who have left the United States and went to foreign countries, allies of the United States, where those countries have refused to extradite them."
"France, for example, in the 1970s, there were Black Panthers who hijacked planes and went to France."
"Now, both France and the United States have extradition treaties."
"Not only that, France signed the 1963 Tokyo Convention, the 1970 Hague Convention and the 1973 Montreal Convention, with the United States."
"All of these are international agreements that require countries, host countries, that are holding individuals—who have hijacked planes—to extradite them or try them."
"France, after conducting their own independent review of these Black Panthers, refused to extradite them to the United States based upon France's assessment that if they would be returned, they would be subject to political and racial repression."
"So, I say that the Cubans"" position is well grounded in international law."
"Now, why today is Assata Shakur now being branded a terrorist?"
"If we look at the definition of terrorism, what is it?"
It is the use or the threat of use of force against a civilian population to achieve political ends.
What happened in the case of Assata Shakur?
"You have heard, in her own words, this woman was a political activist."
She was targeted by whom?
J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in a program that was called COlNTELPRO.
That program was unveiled by whom?
"Frank Church, Senator Frank Church, in the 1970s."
He chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"That committee determined that the FBI was using both legal, but mostly illegal, methods—to do what?"
"In the FBl's own words, they wanted to discredit, to stop the rise of a black messiah— that was the fear of the FBl— so that there would not be a Mau Mau, in their words, uprising in the United States."
"And they were, of course, referring to the liberation movement that occurred in Kenya, Africa."
"Now, the FBI carried out a campaign targeting not only the Black Panther Party."
They targeted SCLC.
They targeted Martin Luther King.
"Just like here in this country if you have the money, you go-- you try doctor after doctor; hospital after hospital; drug after drug in order to find a cure."
"The family tried former lovers, former spouses of lovers, people he had dealings with in nearby villages."
They were on the fourth or fifth tribe and they were suspecting a woman in a village just to the north.
Ferdinand had taken some of her goods to the market to sell but he had given all the money back that he owed her.
"But before they got an answer about her, Ferdinand had died."
"So if they'd found the witch in time, they could have saved his life."
These stories show how witchcraft brings social conflicts the surface and resolves them openly.
"You confront the suspected witch; you apologized; you negotiate; you right the wrong; you pay the compensation, and you get better, hopefully."
"So, in this sense, witchcraft could be seen as a means of conflict resolution."
"And for all you future doctors, witchcraft does not contradict science complements it."
The Zande acknowledge that the pills that they take and the shots that they get the medical clinics work.
And they love them.
But they also know that medicine alone cannot cure a serious illness.
The medicine will only work if the witchcraft is withdrawn.
So they have to [inaudible] the social reason as well as the medical cause of the illness.
Or not just the medical cause of the illness.
They find and confront the wish or the person will get better.
Even educated Zande who understand biology and physiology can still believe in witchcraft just as many Western doctors can still believe in God.
"The biology and the physiology explain the how-- the mechanism-- but not the why no matter how good a scientist you are, you probably can't explain why a mutation occurs in one person rather than another."
"And you may have noticed that while explaining and healing, this belief system also allows people to blame other people for their misfortune."
This idea is not foreign to the United States.
"Where if you spill your hot coffee and it burns your thighs, you can blame it on the fast food store that sold you the coffee."
"In fact, there seems to be a tendency among us humans to blame someone else for our misfortunes."
Witchcraft is one way of doing that.
"But instead of blaming an institution, a government, a foreign people, a God or a devil, the Zande blame their neighbors."
People they know and interact with daily.
They can confront a suspected witch and resolve the problem face-to-face.
"The truth is, people are always doing things that make us mad."
They take the last parking spot.
They cut us off in traffic.
They get the last tickets to a concert or to a [inaudible] event.
They get a job we want.
"We'll talk about one later on that is, does have weight gain."
"But Paroxetine, of the SSRls, is probably your highest risk adding maybe about five pounds, to ten pounds."
"Sertraline, or Zoloft, is used at a dose anywhere from 50-200mg."
"Again, various indications."
"Some of the unique aspects of this are it can be a little more activating; we have some actual slight dopamine activity, so that can give a little bit of activation."
Dopamine often functions very similarly to norepinephrine.
"It can be helpful in an actual atypical depression, which we're not really focusing on during this talk, but those patients, that subset, that sleep more and eat more."
"We do see quite a bit of diarrhea and sweating with this clinically, so you have to be careful with initiation too, with patients."
"And then, again, you have to taper this medication."
"Pretty much every antidepressant, except for Prozac or Fluoxetine, you have to taper."
"Fluoxetine, with that long half-life, tapers itself."
"Citalopram, or Celexa, is actually, when looking at the pictures, probably the clean SSRI that we think of."
All it really touches is Serotonin.
"There's a little, little bit of antihistamine activity, so sedation is about 50/50 with this drug."
So half the patients say if they take it in the morning they're tired in the afternoon.
"Half of them, it doesn't make any difference."
"If they're taking the medicine in the morning, and really tired in the afternoon, they can switch it, potentially, to bedtime to help with that."
There's really no drug interactions.
"There's an advantage in the elderly with this, because it's a very clean, useful drug."
It does have two sides to it: it's broken down.
And so it has an inactive side in terms of when the liver metabolizes it.
And that becomes important because it leads into the next drug we're going to talk about.
"So, we're going to kind of transition into Citalopram to Escitalopram."
"And you see, Citalopram on the top has R and S enantiomers."
"And the liver metabolizes this drug into two components: an ""R"" enantiomer - which basically, think about this, is the liver makes active and inactive drug."
And the active drug is something called Escitalopram or Lexapro.
And so these two are really what we often refer to as cousins.
They're very similar medications.
"So, when looking at Escitalopram versus Citalopram, again, you see a little bit different dosage with the Lexapro in that we can kind of get a little bit lower dosage because, you see, it's about 100 times more potent than Citalopram."
"Meaning that it's not necessarily more effective; it's just occupying all receptors with active drugs, versus some receptors with inactive drug."
Some of the studies suggest that 10mg of Lexapro is about equivalent to 20-40mg of Citalopram.
"This can be an insurance issue, though."
And yet all the silver in the mines of Potosi couldn't help the inexorable economic and political decline of Spain's empire.
Why was that when Pizarro seemed to have struck it so incredibly rich?
The answer is that the Spaniards had dug up so much silver to finance their wars of conquest that the metal itself suffered an extraordinary decline in value.
More silver coins didn't make Spain richer.
They simply made prices higher as an increased quantity of money chased the same amount of goods.
What the Spaniards didn't get was that money is only worth what other people will give in exchange for it.
"And whether money takes the form of silver coins, sea shells, bars of gold, or bank notes, that's been true from Ancient times right down to the present day."
Even lumps of clay can work better than silver coins if people have enough confidence in them.
"In Ancient Mesopotamia, nearly 4 000 years ago, people used clay tablets, like these ones, to commit themselves to particular financial transactions."
"For example, this one, found a little southwest of Baghdad, specifies that a debtor will repay a lender 330 measures of grain on the harvest day."
But this one's even more fascinating because what it says is that a debt of 4 measures of barley should be repaid to the bearer of the clay tablet.
And it's that idea of repayment to the bearer that really fascinates me.
"If the phrase sounds familiar, then it should."
Just take a look at the 20 pound note.
Bank notes have next to no intrinsic worth.
"They're simply promises to pay just like the clay tablets of Ancient Babylon, 4 millennia ago."
"On the back of the 10 dollar bill, it says ""In God We Trust""."
But it's not really God you're trusting in.
"By swapping your goods or your labour for a fistful of these things, you're trusting the U.S. Treasury Secretary not to repeat Spain's mistake and produce so many of the damn things that by the time you come to spend them, they're worth even less than the paper they're printed on."
"Today, we're quite happy with paper money."
"Even more amazingly, we're happy with money we can't even see."
Millions of dollars pass through this woman's hands every day.
"Or rather, across her computer screen."
"She's a foreign exchange dealer, whose business is literally buying and selling money."
"Each day, around $3 trillion changes hands in transaction like these around the world."
And it's all built on trust.
It has to be when you can't even touch the stuff.
That's what the Conquistadors got wrong.
"They failed to see that money is about trust, even faith; trust in the person paying you the money; trust in the central bank issuing the money; trust in commercial bank that honours the cheque."
Money isn't metal.
It's trust inscribed.
"And it doesn't much matter what it's inscribed on-- paper, silver, clay, or a screen-- provided the recipient believes in it."
"So, if the interval is zero, that means that the distance between the events in light-years, for example, is equal to the time separation in years, because that's--because this term has to be exactly equal to that term there, in order for them to subtract out and get zero."
And the c^(2) converts from light-years to years and back again.
"And so, what does that mean?"
"That means if you emit a photon at one event, that same photon can, if it's going in the right direction, be present at the second event."
"So, if you ride along with light you'll see both--you'll participate in both these events."
"So, you sit at event one."
You flash a light.
"You ride along with the expanding light waves from that event and you get to something one light-year away, exactly a year later."
"And so, if the second event is one light-year away in distance and a year later in time, that same photon will be present at the second event, as at the first event."
"So, things that have one of these intervals of zero are separated by an appropriate amount so that the same ray of light can participate in both of them."
"So, if the interval--let's keep that up there for a minute."
"If the interval is negative, what does that mean?"
The distance is less than the light travel time.
"So, the photon is already past the second event."
"So, if you were to emit a ray of light at event number one, it would have passed the second event by the time it occurred."
The photon has already gone by.
"And similarly, if the interval is positive, then the light photon hasn't reached event two--hasn't yet reached event two."
"Now, this is important, because this means that you can't communicate from event one to event two."
"So, if you're at event two, you don't know what happened at event one."
"Because even if you'd sent out a signal, a radio signal or whatever, it would not have reached you by the time event two takes place."
So you can't communicate from event one to event two.
"And similarly, you can't travel from event one and reach event two, because you'd have to go faster than the speed of light to do it."
"These kinds of intervals, these negative intervals, these are called time-like, because the time term is larger than the distance turn."
And these kinds of intervals are called space-like intervals.
And you can only travel or communicate over time-like intervals.
Yes?
Student:
What are these so-called events?
Professor Charles
Bailyn:
"So, they're events--you can think of them as points in space-time."
"So, they have a particular position in space and a particular point in time."
"So, the eight%, the higher returns, the more likely it is that you are jumping all over the place, like the stock market."
"So, if you want to be safer, what you have to do?"
"You have to lower the interest rate to say, four%."
"Put it in a bond issued by the government, in the long run, and you'll be safer."
But what will happen to the 2.59 million?
Do this exercise for yourself.
"Let's, after this class is over, use four percent instead of eight%."
And what will you see?
A dramatic drop in the amount of money that you have at the end.
"So, what, why am I emphasizing so much in one little problem?"
"Because that's what Finance's beauty is, you know."
"If you understand these problems inside out, and you know how to use the Excel spreadsheet to calculate the answer, you've arrived."
"So, if you use four%, what happens?"
You kind of get rid of your nervousness about risk.
But what happens to the amount of money you have?
"It'll drop dramatically, right?"
We know that.
We know the power of compounding.
"It helps when an interest rate goes up, it hurts when it goes down."
"So, having said that, if the interest rate is four%, you're going to suffer."
"What, what can you say about the eight%, four percent choice?"
Neither one is good or bad.
Neither one is good or bad.
"What's important is you have control over the four and the eight in the following sense, not that you can predict it but you, if you choose to put four percent in your calculations, it has to be matched by your investment strategy."
"So, if you are thinking you're going to earn eight percent and put it in the bank, especially today, and if this low interest rates go on, you're dreaming."
"You'll have closer to $400,000, if the bank is still there after 40 years, right?"
"So, so think"
like that.
"Everything is under your control and the beauty of markets is for most of us, we do not need to second guess what the interest rates are."
All we need to do is match our preferences of risk with our investment strategy and then not worry about it too much.
"Hi, wo shi"
"We now know what an oxidation state or and oxidation number is and what it means when things are oxidized or reduced and lets see how that actually happens in reactions so what we're going to study is this video is oxidation/reduction reactions and all that is a reaction where somebody is being oxidized, which means electroons are being taken away from them, and someone's being reduced, which means they are being handed electrons or they are taking electrons away from someone else, and sometimes this has been termed, because you have the red in reduction and you have the ox in oxidation an they switch them around and they call i it a redox reaction, and it sounds like a very fancy chemistry term but it just means a reaction where something is getting oxidized and if something is getting oxidized, something else is getting reduced, so lets study a bunch of them."

I don't want to pay.
These highways have already been paid for.
"If you get to a toll station and you say, ""I don't want to pay"" they have to let you pass."
"On May 1st, at 12 PM, get to a toll booth and say:"
#IDontWantToPay
- Not paying a toll is NOT a crime.
- Highway personelle do NOT have the right to ask for ID.
- A red or green toll booth light is NOT an official transit symbol.
- Holding you at the toll booth for not wanting to pay is illegal holding and you can report it to the police.
NO MORE TOLLS

Ulnar collateral ligament testing of the thumb is performed to evaluate for instability found on a gamekeeper's or skier's thumb.
"After stabilizing the first metacarpal, a valgus stress is applied to the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint."
Laxity indicates a partial or complete ulnar collateral ligament tear.
This is the cutter section of the panel.
The top button labeledÂ CutterÂ opens up the cutter dialog.
"This dialog lets you choose which cutter manufacturer you are using, and which model your cutter is."
"The lower button â gives information about the vinyl size of the cutter, if the machine and the communication method support it."
Here you can find the maximum vinyl-size.
"Consequently, in order to set a larger tile-size, you set a larger vinyl-size."
"My name is Marvin Meyer, I am the Chair of the Department of Religious studies and the Griset Professor of Religious Studies at Chapman University."
"I came to Chapman a long time ago, as a matter of fact, just over 25 years ago so it must have been then, 1985 that I came here as a younger assistant professor of Religious Studies."
"Well, I came here to Chapman because there was a job, and to be honest about it, sometimes it's difficult to find a job in this profession."
There aren't a lot of jobs available.
"And I've never been unemployed, I've always had a job, but there was a job here, but I also came to this particular job, I did have some other possibilities, but I came to this job because I knew something about Chapman."
"I had been on the campus before, I had known some of the professors here."
"In fact, my predecessor was a friend of mine and Fred Francis was his name."
"I came to visit him here, and then I also am a singer and I sang with Bill Hall in the William Hall Corral for a number of years we would rehearse upon occasion on the campus and so I came to campus to the music building and I thought it was a pretty nice campus and when there was an opening I decided to go for it and I went for it, and here I am."
"Well, when I came here back in the 1980s the entire campus of Chapman College at that time, it was smaller and it was quieter, and the department of religion, as it was called at that time, was a much smaller department."
First of all the equality relation must be reflexive.
"This means that the relation holds of every term in the language for itself for all x, x = x."
Relation must also be symmetric.
"If two terms refer to the same thing, it does not matter which one we write in the equation, for all x is equals y implies y=x."
Finally the relation must be transitive.
If we believe that a = b refer to the same object and we believe that b and c refer to the same object then a and c must refer to the same object as well.
Let's see how we can use these properties to solve some problems of equality.
Suppose we know that b = a and we know that b = c.
Let's prove that a = c as well.
As usual we start our proof with our premises.
B = a and b = c.
We add our axioms for equality First reflexivity then symmetry and then transitivity.
Now we go to work on the proof.
"First, we use two applications of universal elimination on our symmetry axiom to derive the fact that b = a implies a = b."
I'm substituting b for x and a for y.
We then use implication elimination on line six and line one to produce a=b.
"We then use universal elimination again to instantiate the transitivity axiom this time with x replaced by a, y replaced by b and z replaced by c."
We can join the result on
"line seven with the premise on line two to, to derive the conjunction on line nine."
And finally we use implication elimination to derive our overall conclusion so it works as expected though it's a bit lengthy.
We'll see a so much faster way to solve problems like this in j ust a short while.
"This exercise test, of understanding of equality by asking you to prove the results, using the basic equality axioms."
"Let's have the vector valued function r of s and t is equal to-- well, x is going to be a function of s and t."
"So we'll just write it as x of s and t times the x unit vector, or i, plus y of s and t times the y unit factor, or j, plus x of s and t times the z unit vector, k."
"So given that we have this vector valued function, let's define or let's think about what it means to take the partial derivative of this vector valued function with respect to one of the parameters, s or t."
"I think it's going to be pretty natural, nothing completely bizarre here."
"We've taken partial derivatives of non-vector valued functions before, where we only vary one of the variables."
We only take it with respect to one variable.
You hold the other one constant.
We're going to do the exact same thing here.
And we've taken regular derivatives of vector valued functions.
Statistics is different.
It is much more clear how gender matters get involve.
If we come to the conclusion that discrimination based on statistics is the one that is relevant in this case.
"We would continue by thinking what we can do so that we grant men access to care taking activities under the same conditions, family, children, basic domestic responsibilities."
"We must assume that most men would be ready to take it up, and many are already doing it."
"Not focusing on a gender war or something alike, but accepting that is a tendency that is also there."
What could we do to speed it up?
"From an economic policy point of view, what could be done?"
And here we have a list of suggestions.
"For us, the first of them is absolutely compulsory."
"That is, to equal the duration of maternity and paternity leaves, something that they're doing already in some other countries,"
"like in Nordic countries, Germany, even in Portugal!"
"Here it's starting, but we have a long road to go."
"We may take as an example the law, that some times sets an example."
"Sometimes, what laws say end up having an influence on our values."
"In this case, what does the law say in relation to parental leave?"
It says that when we have a child mothers have 16 weeks to take care of the children and fathers have only 2.
The law makes the father role look less important.
In such an important moment as that.
"Because many men find out what is taking care and what are egalitarian attitudes at that very same moment, when they really start getting involved, when they take care of their own children."
"It is a key moment, but here the law says no that this is mainly a woman's thing."
"Plus, it is the only legal discrimination based on gender that is left in Spanish law."
"We believe that if we don't change this, no matter what deadline we set."
We should change it to a month.
"We were supposed to pass this law in January, but it has been postponed due to budget deficit."
This is a key point for us.
The next one is the elimination of the gender bias in the reconciliation of work and family life.
"Sorry, did I go overtime?"
(Audience) No.
"The gender bias or feminine bias, regarding reconciliation in companies."
This is also very interesting for us.
"Through studies about reconciliation of work and family life we have observed that sometimes, human resources departments in companies only think of it as a need of their women workers."
"Apple versus PC, or even if you go back to 1999 with The Matrix, you remember that there was a pure white background."
You see it on TV all the time these days.
"It's an effect that makes things look professional, so if you have a spokesperson, kind of like the way this is right now, if you have a spokesperson, or talking, having a pure, white background really enhances the professionalism of the specific shot that you're doing."
"The one thing is, most websites, not all, but many, are white in background, so if you put a video with an infinite white background on top of the web page with a white background, it kind of"
"looks like the person is floating on the web page, so it's a really great way to look very professional."
"So, today I am going to show you kind of my secrets behind the scenes if you will."
"Some truth in advertising, I am doing this not in a studio, but in my apartment. so I am going to give you a little tour, how to set up, and hopefully I am not going to miss out on anything in terms of details."
"I'll also have this transcript below this blog post, and, so if you want to read you can read it, and I also list all of the materials that you're going to need all the equipment so that you can figure out exactly what you need to make this effect work."
"So, let's get started."
"Ok, basically a little behind the scenes."
"You can see that this is my apartment, and yeah it's the holidays as I am recording this."
This is actually a white screen.
Now what I did was purchase a white projection screen because I needed to be able to put it up and take it down.
"I didn't want this thing in my, you know, I didn't want to put a sheet there."
"Basically, this is a white screen that you can buy on Amazon for about $70."
I will provide all the details below.
"You could also use a white wall, a white piece of fabric, or even a, you know, kind of a bed sheet type of thing."
You could do that as well.
"I preferred this because there are no wrinkles, fabric you would have to iron, and it gets to be a pain."
"A white wall probably would work if you have the room to do a white wall, so you can see my walls are greenish in color, and they're not white."
"So, I got the screen."
The next thing you want to do is you have here the lights.
"Now, you can see that there are two sets of lights on this side, and then we have two on there."
"Those are the screen lights, and basically what you want to do is these shop lights are available at Home Depot or anywhere else, Amazon, wherever you want to buy it, and their shop lights, 13, I am sorry, 10-inch shop lights, they are available for $13."
The next thing is
"I have in here, sorry to blind you, these look like gigantic"
"CFLs because they are, so on both sides of the screen I have these four gigantic high, very high"
lumen daylight CFL bulbs.
"Basically, I would go with at least a 50 watt, 2300 lumen bulb."
"The one I am using is an 85 watt, 4800"
lumen bulb.
"What you want to do is make sure they are daylight, so you are looking at probably, you want to choose something that's"
"It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own... over to camera 2...Hi there, camera 2, it's me, John Green,"
let's start with that double cheeseburger.
"Oh, food photography, so this contains 490 calories."
"To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed, raise and slaughter cows then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination."
You also have to grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elisabeth I. Then you have to milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese.
"That's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers or the sweetening of tomatoes and the grinding of mustard seeds, etc."
How in the sweet name of everything holy have we ever come to live in a world where such a thing can even be created.
"And how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US, I can earn it in 11 minutes!"
"And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of relative abundance."
"Well, to answer that question, we are not going to be able to"
"look strictly at history, because there isn't a written record about a lot of these things."
"But thanks to archaeology and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"So 15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters."
"Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses."
"Hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet, as long you could find something with meat to kill."
By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world incidentally was fishing.
"Which is one of the reasons why when you look at the history of people populating the planet, we tended to run for the shore and stay there."
"Marine life was A, abundant, and B, relatively unlikely to eat you."
"While we tend to think the lives of the foragers were nasty, brutish and short, fossil evidence suggests that they actually had it pretty god."
Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists.
And anthropologists who studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually they spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us.
"And they spend more time on art, music and storytelling."
Also if you believe the classic of anthropology
"""Nisa"", they also have a lot more time for skoodilypooping."
What?
I call it skoodilypooping.
I am not going to apologize.
It's worth noting that the cultivation of crops seems to have risen independently over the course of millenia.
"And the number of places, from Africa, to China, to the Americas, using crops that naturally grew nearby."
"Rise in Southeast Asia, maize in Mexico, potatoes in the Andes, wheat in the fertile crescent, yams in West Africa."
People around the world began to abandon their foraging for agriculture.
"I got 5,000 unknowns, I've got, 500 constraints, you know what?"
"Four and a half thousand of these are going to just be zero, I know that from the beginning."
Have to pick out which ones.
"But if you did a histogram, you could see this big spike, of information zero."
"Its going to try to set, four and a half thousand things to zero."
"Its not going to try, it will set, and its going to pick 500 things to be non-zero that satisfy this and give you this small L norm."
"Okay, Promotes sparsity and the fact is you know there's sparsity in the signal, okay."
In this section we're going to talk about celiac disease and the gluten free diet.
So what is celiac disease?
Celiac is an autoimmune disease.
"It's also called gluten sensitive enteropathy, or celiace sprue."
"In celiac disease, gluten, which is a component of food, leads to villus atrophy, in the small intestine."
"The only therapeutic approach that has been known to treat celiac disease effectively, is maintenance of and adherence to a gluten-free diet."
Here's a picture of what villus atrophy
looks like.
On the left-hand side you can see what a normal healthy small intestine looks like.
"You notice all of these finger-like projections, the villi, which is where the majority of nutrients are absorbed."
"In celiac disease, the presence of gluten in the foods cuts down the height of the intestinal villi, and you end up with this flattened surface, like you see here."
"A flattened surface like this, cannot effectively absorb nutrients."
And so the people who have celiac disease end up having a variety of deficiencies of micro nutrients.
"Not to mention, absorption problems that often times result in things like diarrhea."
How prevalent is celiac disease?
Well researchers go back and forth about just how many people we think have it.
"One of the problems is, many people who have celiac disease are not diagnosed."
"In the US, historically, we've said that the rates are 1 in 133, there's other statistics that suggest it might be more"
like 1 in 100.
"In Europe, it's somewhere between that amount, and it's even higher in individuals who have a first degree relative."
"So the likelihood is that you have a 1 in 22 chance, of having celiac, if you have a first degree relative with it."
"Again, one of the problems is, that very few people who have celiac disease are actually ever diagnosed."
"We're seeing increasing rates of diagnosis with celiac disease, not because more people are getting it, but because the testing mechanism is more sensitive and more specific."
"And to be honest, practitioners are looking for celiac more now than they did previously."
A study that was done recently in the
But that's going to be ok because I'm not going to be a moving target.
I'm going to rest my hand on top of my hand to go into my patient.
"So that's ok, there's no way I'm going to stick myself here."
I'm not moving toward my hand.
"So with a 90 degree angle, a nice smooth motion I'm going to inject the medicine the length of the needle into the patient's muscle."
Move my nondominant hand to hold the barrel of the syringe.
Aspirate by pulling back up on the plunger.
Check for blood return.
No blood return.
Administer my medication slowly.
"I draw my needle and I can message it a little bit here, ok?"
This needle is now dirty; it is not recapped.
Toss it in your patient's sharps box.
Ok.
So then I would reposition my patient and do my documentation.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In this module we're going to introduce Martingales.
Martingales play a very important role in finance.
"They won't play a hugely important role in this course, but they will crop up now and again and it's worthwhile understanding what they are and seeing one or two examples of Martingales."
"We're going to have the following definition of a Martingale, a random process, Xn is a martingale, with respect to the information filtration Fn and probability distribution P, if these two conditions are satisfied."
The first condition is just a technical integrability condition which states that the expected value of the absolute value of Xn must be finite for all n.
"The really important condition, is condition two here, which states that the expected value of Xn plus m, given Fn, is equal to Xn for all nm greater than or equal to 0."
A quick comment on what I mean by information filtration.
"So the information filtration, Fn, is just a complicated way of recognizing the information we have at time n."
So Fn will denote all of the information in our model that we know at time n.
"So usually, you will actually, it'd be the case that Fn is equal to the information given to you by X1 up to Xn."
"So basically, it's just recognizing that at time n, we've already seen the values"
X1 up to Xn.
"Returning to condition two here, we see that what this is really saying, is that the expected value of X, at any time in the future, is equal to its current value today."
"And so, Martingales have often been used to, to model what are called fair games, they've got a rich history in gambling, for example."
"Because this condition here, models the idea of a fair game, so your future pay-off, or your expected future pay-off, is equal to your current wealth today, Xm."
"We define a sub martingale, by replacing condition two with a greater than or equal to sign, And we define a super martingale by replacing condition two with a less than or equal to sign."
A martingale then is both a sub martingale and a super martingale.
Going perpendicular to the blackboard right through the middle.
The different R2 - R1 equals lambda would again give me constructive interference.
"That would be a hyperbola then, R2 - R1 equals"
"lambda, that would again be a maximum, and you can draw the same line on this side, and then R2 - R1 being 2 lambda again would be a maximum."
"And again, if this is three-dimensional, you can rotate it about this line and you get bowls."
"And so in between you're obviously going to get the minima, the destructive interference,"
"lambda divided by two, and then here you would have R2"
- R1 is 3/2 lambda.
"We call these lines where you kill each other, destructive interference, we call them nodal lines or in case you have a surface it's a nodal surface."
"And the maxima are sometimes also called antinodes, but I may also refer to them simply as maxima."
And so this is what we call an interference pattern.
"If you look right here between -- on the line between the two points, then you should be able to convince yourself that the linear separation here between two"
lines of maxima is one-half lambda.
Figure that out at home.
That's very easy.
Also the distance between these two yellow lines here right in between is one-half lambda.
And so that tells you then that the number of lines or surfaces which are maxima is very roughly 2D divided by one-half lambda.
"So this is the number of maxima, which is also the same roughly as the number of minima, is then approximately 2D divided by lambda."
"And so if you want more maxima, if you want more of these surfaces, you have a choice, you can make D larger or you can make the wavelength shorter."
"And if you make the wavelength shorter you can do that by increasing the frequency, if you had that control."
The first thing that I'm going to do is to make you see these nodal lines with a demonstration of water.
"We have here two sources that we can tap on the water and the distance between those two tappers, D, is 10 centimeters, so we're talking about water here."
"Uh, we will tap with a frequency of about 7 hertz and what you're going to see are very clear nodal lines, this is a two-dimensional surface, where the water doesn't move at all."
The mountains and the valleys arrive at the same time.
The water is never moving at all.
So let me make sure that you can see that well.
And so I have to change my -- my lights.
"I'll first turn it on, that may be the easiest."
Starts tapping already.
I can see the nodal lines very well.
So here you see the two tappers and here you see a line whereby the water is not moving at all.
At all moments in time it's standing still.
"The question would be well, ya why is it, why are these negative instance such a big deal."
Why can't we just reduce shortest path competition with negative edge links to the problem of computing shortest paths with non negative edge links.
Right so whatever just clear things out we just add big number to all the edges that makes them all non-negative and now we just run Dijkstra's algorithm and we're good to go.
"So this is exactly the sort of question you should be looking to ask, if, as a computer scientist, as a serious programmer."
When confronted with a problem you always want to look for ways to reduce it to simpler problems that you already know how to solve.
And this is a very natural idea of how to reduce a seemingly harder sort of path problem to one we already know how to solve using dutch [inaudible] algorithm.
The only problem is it doesn't quite work.
One isn't gonna work.
"Well if you, Let's say you have a graph, and the most negative edge is -ten."
So all the edge lengths are negative ten and above.
"So then what you'd want to do is add ten to every single edge in the network, and that insures that all of the edge lengths are non negative, run Dijkstra's algorithm, get your shortest path."
The is sue is that different.
Paths between a common origin and destination have differing numbers of edges.
"So some might have five edges, Some might have two edges."
Now if you add ten to every single edge in the graph you're going to change path lengths by different amounts.
"If a path has five edges, it's going to go up by 50, when you add ten to every edge."
"If a path has only two edges, It's only going to go up by twenty, when you add ten to every edge."
"So as soon as you start changing the path lengths of different paths by different amounts, you might actually screw up which path is the shortest."
The path which is shortest under the new edge lengths need not be the one that's shortest under the old edge
lengths.
So that's why this reduction doesn't work.
"To be concrete, let's look at this very simple three vertex graph with vertices s, v, and t and edge lengths as shown."
One minus five and minus two.
"Now what I hope is clear, is that in this graph."
The shortest path.
"The one with the minimum length is the two hot path Svt,"
That has length minus four.
The direct STR has length minus two which is bigger than minus four.
So the upper path is the shortest path.
"Now, suppose we tried to massage this by adding a constant to every edge so all edge lengths were non-negative."
We'd have to add five to every edge because that's the biggest negative number the VT edge.
So that would give us new edge lengths of six.

"If we treat an encryption function--as the one in GSM--as something that takes a message, produces an encrypted message, and it consumes a key to perform that."
There are different ways in which you can make this resistant against time-memory trails.
Three different mitigations.
"First, you can make the message unpredictable."
Sounds obvious.
Why would you encrypt something predictable?
"But a lot of systems do just encrypt a whole stream of data, some of which is encrypted."
Something is worth protecting.
GSM mixes the two.
[Dave]
All of these attacks you know some--because of the GSM protocol-- there are some messages that are very easy to guess. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [Carson]
Exactly.
[Dave]
And you know what they are and can you those in this attack.
"To exchange a text message, for instance, between the base station and your phone, somewhere between 20 and 40 messages are exchanged, only one of which has the actual text message content."
Another one may have some unpredictable set of information.
All the rest is just management information--encrypted though-- and that management information is usually--
[Dave]
Does it make sense as one solution to not encrypt the management information.
[Carson]
"Clear, yeah."
There's a standard extension that suggests exactly that.
But basically the whole ecosystem would have to change to accommodate for that.
"Currently, it's just the encryption is switched on at some point and everything thereafter is encrypted, be it predictable or not."
"There are measures, though, to make predictable messages more randomized to create some wiggle room for how you send a message."
"That's currently being deployed--not in all networks, though."
I've not seen--one of the two American networks I don't think has it.
You need to know the base station is understanding if you change the protocol like that.
"The base station would have to change to go all the way of making all messages unpredictable, but even changing the base station controllers, bigger installations that control dozens of base stations that control dozens of base stations would do the job, and those are usually software updateable, because they have to accommodate for usually faster connections all the time."
"So as product designers, we always have to be asking this question, what associations are people going to make from what they're looking at here?"
"Sometimes it seems absurd looking at a simple web form thinking, what associations are people going to make with this thing?"
What does this look like?
"So in these design processes, this is one exercise that we do, and I would highly recommend it."
It's not hard to get started.
"Just pull up a whole bunch of imagery and start sorting out on the table, start making these associations."
What should our product feel like?
What does our product feel like right now?
What do our competitors' products feel like?
What associations do we need to evoke in the minds of our users?
So now we're talking about how to make people care.
"There's one last idea I want to put out there, that one of the best ways to make people care about our products is to show people that we care about our products."
"Now, this is a reality about perception that's hard wired into our brains that sometimes very small things can make a really big difference in how we see something."
"Now, I don't know whether, if I download an app that has a poorly-executed app icon, whether it's going to be more flaky or whether it's going to crash on me."
I haven't necessarily seen the data with that correlation.
But I do know that that's the association that users are going to make based on millions of years of evolution.
"When you see something that's not quite the right color or that has a hole in the wrong place, you bite that fruit, you might be seeing the second half of a worm."
"So also, we need to do not miss the opportunities to do the things that we don't have to."
"Those little pieces of design in places where they're not needed, where they're uncalled for, tell the user that hey, a designer was here."
Somebody thought about this.
They're like little love notes for our users.
"It's the interactive doodle on the home page, or the mint on the pillow, what you put on the back of the box in the package."
It's the hidden extra level of the game.
"There's value in doing these things that don't have an apparent commercial purpose, where we're showing people that we care so they'll care enough to use our products."
"In this case, PacMan didn't help people to finish their searches faster."
"It probably actually got in the way for some people, me included."
"But people loved it, and why?"
Because we didn't have to do it.
It's like a note or flowers.
It's these intangibles that show people that we care.
"Here's another small example that comes from Google Now, where the Context Header changes based on your time of day or your location."
"And when we were making these, during the process people said, this is going to be hard."
A good example of a house in a more rural part of Connecticut.
"So keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own behavior, the way you grew up, and you try to consider how your lifestyle choices influenced your family's consumption level."
"Also, I want you to think about the idea of size, and how we are increasingly dependent upon many consumer products in our lives that are larger than they used to be."
And housing is no exception.
"So that the average house size in 2009 is grown to about 2,500 square feet, with about two point three on average people per house."
That's really pretty remarkable.
"So you know, roughly 1,000 square feet per person."
"Whereas back in 1950, the average number of people in a house was much closer to three, a little bit over three with the post-World War II baby boom, with a total size of 800 square feet."
So the house size has grown by three fold.
"In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet."
So the energy demands of a larger house like that are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into account the diversity of building materials.
"Boy, I apologize for this."
"And, you know, one of you might go outside and"
let them know that there's a lecture going on in here.
That would be really nice.
The construction is creating also diesel fumes inside the building.
Many of the garages that you find in suburban areas also have grown in size.
So here's an example of a garage that is actually larger than the average house size was back in 1950.
"This is probably about a twenty-two, twenty-three by thirty foot house."
"So that's roughly 1,200 square feet, pretty interesting."
Now think about the way that space is laid out.
So here's a studio apartment on the right hand side.
"And you see a dining table, a kitchenette, walk-in closet and a bath on the upper level."
Whereas the base level is dominated by a garage.
So that we're allocating less space indoors to our bedrooms than we are to our auto storage areas.
"Also, many buildings are now constructed with much more glass in them than previously."
And the newer high-end buildings are using special glass that is designed to reflect radiation so that it's not absorbed.
But different glasses are really designed for different climatic regions so that some are more efficient at reflecting radiation that are used in southern climates that are warmer.
"And others are more efficient at providing insulation, so they've got a barrier in the interior that basically protects against heat loss."
"So that overall though, buildings' increased use of windows has created increased energy demands."
Also lighting.
And also the way that we have increasingly designed bathrooms to have more than one fixture.
"And you can see, in blue we have the three peaks, where the immediate release is up to three times a day."
The sustained release goes up to twice a day.
"So you can see that same coverage of spectrum, and the XL is once a day."
"You're going to get ultimately equivalent doses, and equivalent action throughout the day, with whatever agent you use."
"But the XL, actually, is I think a nice drug option in this population, if it's actually covered on the insurance."
"They're almost all generic now, so it is becoming not an issue."
"But the Buproprion XL is just a nice, clean agent that we can utilize so we don't have issues with"
late evening activation or anything like that.
Mirtazapine is probably one of the most confusing agents we have.
It's an Alpha-2 antagonist.
And we're going to try to walk through how the medication works.
This is not a reuptake inhibitor.
So it's a completely different shift of how we're doing antidepressants.
"It's that we're actually going to try to stimulate the manufacturing, so to speak, of the neurotransmitters."
"So, you can see that we have action on the alpha 2 antagonist's effects, to increase both serotonin and norepinephrine."
And we do this - inserting this drug - on different areas of the neurotransmitters.
"And then, these two neurons talk to each other with the end result of increasing norepinephrine, which is actually the triangles, and the serotonin, which is the little yellow tadpoles."
"So, you do get a dual-action, it's just not in the same way that we've done in the past, where we've kindof blocked that pump action, where the neurotransmitter can't get sucked back up."
This time we're actually trying to stimulate action.
"So, Mirtazapine has multiple formulations, again."
"Remeron, Remeron Sol Tab, Mirtazapine, and Mirtazapine Sol Tab."
The SoluTab does not have any absorption increase rate.
It's just a benefit in patients who have swallowing difficulties.
It's not absorbed in the mouth; it just dissolves.
"Which might be helpful in the elderly, for example."
"This is an Alpha 2 antagonist 5HT3, 2A, 2C antagonist."
"So, what we'll show you in the next slide is how we're kind of targeting where - directing, exactly which serotonin receptors we want the serotonin to go to once we've increased it, to help control some of the side effects."
The dosage is anywhere from 15 to 45 milligrams to be dosed at bedtime.
The side effects with this drug are kind of unique.
"We've got sedation, which is why it's just at bedtime."
"Interestingly, the lower end of the doses are more sedating than the higher end of the doses."
"So, 15 milligrams is actually more tiring than 45, but they should always all be dosed at bedtime."
Computers allowed us to generate digital contents.
Internet has allowed us to share those contents.
Nowadays more than ever before we have access to tools that allow us to understand our reality and to transform it.
"By backing this project you will collaborate to make ""smart cities"" being produced by smart citizens."
"Hello, my name is Martin Hausenblas and I'd like to thank you."
"By now there are more than 45,000 marketers in more than 170 countries worldwide."
"Thanks to your hard work, taxi drivers and passengers have also begun registering."
The highest priority now is to launch Liftago in the first 4 markets:
"Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania."
"The better we launch in these markets, the easier and faster the launch will be in the markets that follow."
Today I'd like to answer some of your questions and also show you the Liftago Taxi app for the first time!
"Before I start, I'd like to point out that the key to success is the understanding of our product and the way we do business."
That's why I'd like to ask you to carefully go over the materials we provide in our newsletters and on our website.
"If you haven't taken a look at them yet, please do so now."
Now to address your questions.
When is the launch of the Liftago service?
"We are launching the service in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania in June."
We'll keep you updated about the launch timing for the next markets.
Our aim was to launch the service a couple of weeks ago.
"Unfortunately though, software development is not as predictable as we'd like it to be, especially when developing such an innovative service as Liftago Taxi, together with our Liftago Community Business."
Currently we have been field-testing the apps and there's still some fine-tuning of features ahead of us before we can launch the service.
What happens after the launch of Liftago Taxi?
"First of all, we'll celebrate!"
"More importantly, the true work will begin."
"We'll launch the full version of the Liftago website for passengers, drivers, and marketers."
We'll launch the apps and send a download link for Google Play or the App Store with your invite code to all of your pre-registered members.
How do we know that a new member belongs to your community?
The key to that is in the invite code.
You've already been using your invite code to register new marketers or to pre-register new taxi drivers and passengers.
"If you don't know how to use it, take a look at our materials on our website."
"After the launch, share your invite link through www.liftago.com, and also directly from the Liftago apps in various forms, such as QR code, sms, e-mail, or social media."
"Users can install our apps also without the invite code, but it will be much easier for them to simply click on your invite link."
"That's counter to justice,"
"I mean, that's counter to common sense!"
"Apparently Judge Deana McDonald isn't aware of the thing called the internet, where names like Will Frey and Austin Zehnder can be spread very very quickly."
"I would call the judge and defense attorneys behind these actions disgusting, but that wouldn't be an appropriate enough word."
So I'll use these words:
WlLL FREY AND AUSTlN ZEHNDER.
"Look, bottom line, in a world where half of rape victims don't say a word, we have a justice system that's encouraging girls to keep their mouth shut, at least one specific girl."
That's completely counter to what we need to have happen in this country.
"It's beyond offensive, it's freakin' wrong."
"So tell us what you think of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder,"
Judge Deana McDonald and defense attorneys Chris Klein and David Majia in the comments down below.

- [Voiceover]
Tree rings are rich with history and can reveal the exact age and geographic origin of a tree trunk or a piece of wood.
"The scientific analysis of tree ring patterns is known as dendrochronology, and was used to learn more about the cabinet's wood."
Only certain types of wood can be analyzed with dendrochronology.
"In the case of the cabinet, the oak interior was most suitable."
"But the end grain of these oak panels, where the tree pattern is visible, was inaccessible."
"So to examine the hidden tree ring pattern of the interior, an innovative method of x-raying was devised."
"To begin, parts of the cabinet were carefully disassembled, transferred to the museum's x-ray laboratory and placed on a rotating table."
"For dendrochronology to be effective, the rings must be measured very accurately."
"Once the tree rings were perfectly aligned, the image was recorded on x-ray film."
"The tree rings were measured from this high resolution image and these results, along with many other samples, were analyzed by a dendrochronologist, who compared the tree ring measurements to weather patterns in different regions, going back in history."
"The dendrochronologist concluded that these oak panels came from a tree that grew in the region of Burgundy, in eastern France, and was cut down in 1574, six years before the cabinet was made."
Even the cabinet's smallest details had much to reveal about its origins.
"The middle drawer is lined with a silk and linen fabric, which is held in place by rose head tacks."
Scientific analysis could tell us whether these tacks are from the 16th century or are later reproductions.
"A loose, broken tack discovered inside the cabinet was prepared for analysis."
It was embedded in liquid resin that was hardened under blue light.
"So because you can't control the people, you feel like well, I'll spend more attention on the things that I can control, the execution time, the amount of storage being used, if it's crashing or not, if it's reproducible."
"And it's not entirely true that people aren't controllable because really, what we're fundamentally dealing with is two information processing machines."
"And that's of course, the CPU and the brain."
"And in some ways, they're very similar, they're both doing computation, one parallel processing, the other one massively parallel."
"One's base2, the other one's based on action potential, so you have dramatically more computational power."
But where they start to be different is we know exactly how computers work.
"We can go back and talk to a lot of people that were kind of instrumental in the field, it hasn't been that long."
"So computer scientists, there's things they're still discovering about how to make things efficient, but it's not"
like there's any part of the machine we don't understand yet.
"Whereas if you talk to someone doing neuroscience or cognitive science, you say, how does the brain work?"
"They have to kind of shrug and say, we're still trying to figure that out."
And that's OK.
We don't have to have a complete knowledge of how the brain works to still have predictable results.
There's enough that we understand about it that we can rely on to get those predictable results.
"So for the purpose of this talk, it's really kind of dehumanizing where we're going to treat people like information processing machines."
"You might think, well no, I'm a special snowflake."
"And yes, you are."
"But you're also, for the purpose of this talk, a uniform snow processing machine."
So three aspects of a great interface.
"First, it needs to be self-describing."
"Secondly, you need to prevent errors, and then third, make users fast."
So we're going to dive into each of these.
"So starting out, self-describing."
"The first thing I want to talk about is this notion of mental model, and a mental model is basically a simulation of reality inside of your mind."
"So to pose a question, how many instances of this talk are happening right now?"
"And of course, the answer is one."
It's right there.
The photons are bouncing off the screen at you.
"And when you're in a big room, you've got the talk there, and that's reality."
"But then on another side, you have the fact that everyone is interpreting the talk in a simulation of the room inside their own head."
"So you have all these simulations going on, and these are the mental models they're building of the reality around them."
"So this is very sort of dystopian movie, maybe we're all in our little pods and we don't know it."
"Three hops to G, one, two, three."
Yep.
There's no faster way to get to G.
"This actually does the right thing in terms of number of hops, but let's take a look at what happen when we went to expand B."
"At this point, even though we have a shortest hop path to B, we don't have a shortest link path to B."
"All we know is that from A, you can reach C in three steps."
"Well, that's really all we know."
"Even this A to D, we don't know, there might be like a half weight path that goes from C to D, but we do know that there's going to be no faster way to get to C right because that is the shortest edge out of A."
Any of the longer edges we're assuming we can't take negative weight edges that would cause this four to get smaller than the three.
All we really know is that this three is the smallest.
"What we should do is not expand B, but we should focus on C."
We now know that there's a path that actually can get us there in 13.
This 10 edge plus the three that it takes to get to C.
We can get to B faster than 15.
We can get to B in 13.
"Now, is that the shortest possible path for B?"
"We don't know cause we know that we could get to D in four and maybe there's a link one,"
I mean ignoring the graph for a second.
"Maybe, there's a link one path that would get us to B, which would be even shorter."
All we know from what we've done so far is that the shortest path from A to D is four.
"Let's lock that down and pull D off of the open list, and let's focus on D."
"D has edges to B, F, and E. Here's B, and here's F and E."
"This path to F through D is going to add another seven for a total of 11, and this path to E through D is going to add another three for a length of seven, and remember there's also a D to B link, which would add nine to this, which would get us there in 13, and we already knew how to get there in 13, so that doesn't really change anything."
"Based on these three, we know the fastest way to A, C, and D, and once that we have also been able to reach, we know that E has the shortest distance, which is seven, and there isn't going to be any faster way to get to E cause there aren't any other nodes that we could get to and then get to E faster than seven."
"We can lock that one down, pull off the open list, add all its edges to the non-completed nodes."
"E can go to F, and it has a link of five."
We could go seven steps to E and then another five to F for a total of 12.
"No, we can already get there in 11."
That's probably not a good idea.
"From E, we can also get to G in one step, which would have been seven plus the additional step for a total of eight, and that's all we can reach from E."
"Looking things over, we now know that the fastest way to get to G is eight steps because the only other way we could get to G would be to visit one of the other nodes, and then go to G, and that would have to be longer than eight."
"We're going to lock it down, and now we pull of the open list and look at the edges out of G."
Are you using this?
"Well, Gwenyth Paltrow is,"
"Julianne Moore,"
"Charlize Theron, and, oh, Hilary Swank, yeah, they're using this product."
What it is is the Opal Eye Treatment.
You use it on the eyes.
It is amazing.
I use this--both of these--every day.
You can use this at morning and at night.
Morning and at night.
"This helps with fine lines, wrinkles, puffy eyes, which I get a lot, because I have allergies and a toddler, so sleep is a precious commodity that I always always get, so I must, must, must use this in dark circles."
"Oh, the dark circles, they-- I don't think they're ever going to go away."
"And the Clarisonic, this helps them as well, so to fight all of my problems, here for my beautiful skin, this will take it to the next level."
"So, again, if you're already using all of these amazing products that I hear, you say, ""I'm good."""
This is what you do to go to the next level.
"We've seen a number of techniques, some in previous lectures and some we talked about in this lecture."
"We've seen the Naive Bayes classifier, fairly in detail."
We've seen some Probabilistic Graphical
Models like Bayesian Networks.
"We've seen linear regression in detail, this time, we also heard about logistic regression neural networks and support vector machines, at least as to what they are."
"And, let's look at the problem and see which kind of techniques one would need to consider depending on the nature of the problem."
"We classify the problem in terms of the kind of features it has, whether they are numerical or categorical, that means numbers or classes."
"And the target variable, which is what we are trying to predict."
"We might be predicting a value, then it becomes a prediction problem where the value is numerical."
"We might be predicting a class in which, in which case it's a classification problem which is part of learning theory."
"Techniques can be used interchangeably across these two different types of prediction based on the kinds of features, of course, some techniques are more applicable than others."
"So, in the most straightforward case,"
"If we have numerical features and a numerical target we want to predict,"
"The correlation is stable and fairly linear, we'd use linear regression."
"Now, when I say stable and fair, fairly linear, even in situations like this,"
One would still prefer to use linear regression rather than some complicated non-linear function.
"Because using high order functions we'd, we'd say squares or cubes and sines and cos's, will tend to over fit the data and will not generalize to situations which may come up, arise in the future."
"Yeah, but this was not just any frog."
"Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus."
"In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles, and in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs, and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart."
"It has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs."
"Now, when biologists saw this, they were agog."
"They thought, this is incredible."
"No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this, to change one organ in the body into another."
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
"If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?"
"Now, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut."
"And just as everybody got excited about it, bang!"
It was extinct.
"I called up my friend,"
Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
"He was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab."
"And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --"" This was 30 or 40 years ago."
"""By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"""
"And he thought about it, and he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade, and he poured through everything in the freezer, and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs."
"This was very exciting, but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen."
"And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell."
"If you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls."
"Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope."
It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact.
"So we thought, let's give it a go."
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
"We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg."
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
"Now, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,"
"like what produced Dolly, but it's actually very different, because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells."
"That was a miracle, but it was workable."
So what we are seeing is that maybe we're just discounting kids too early and we are assessing them at the wrong times.
And it is kind of a predetermined future if you do it that way.
Tom:
How did we loose our way in this country when it came to science education?
Tom:
How did we loose our way when comes to science education in this country?
"When I was a younger guy, the Russians were beating us into Space so a lot of people went into Engineering, went into Sciences."
The Space Race helped accelerate all of that.
"But then we lost our way, it seems to me, in the last part of the 20th century."
Sal:
"You know, I think that it has just been bad branding."
"I think, you know its funny, because Science and Engineering are fundamentally creative professions."
"I mean 'engineering', the word 'engineering' is to build things that have never been built before."
"And the way it's shown and the way, and all of the hoops that you have to jump through in your education, make it look like its a non-creative field, but when you look at it in the real world, it is a very creative field."
"So I think the real thing is to get more kids engaged, to show them that 1) the math and science itself is beautiful and it tells us more about the universe, or as much about the universe, as philosophy or anything else."
"It really is a form of philosophy and not only that, but the end point you're going to isn't a boring job."
"It is a creative job, it is redefining what people's experiences are."
"I think that if you do it that way,"
I think that a lot of more people will want to get into it.
Tom:
"I take of Cyber Space is the new second 'Big Bang', we're creating this new universe our there, just like we did with the physical first bang."
"And one of the things that's happening is that we're watching all these planets which one is going to drift too close to the sun, which ones are going to form together and form new lifeforms."
"As you look at your model which has been successful, have you already began to think: how can we expand that model to other areas?"
Sal:
"Yeah, we've already thought about it."
"So you know that we have the videos I do right now and we have this whole software platform and I think the interesting thing is we are going to start branching off from mathematics, our videos already cover the things in biology and economics and all the rest."
"But our exercise platform: try to do economics, physics, chemistry, and then start to think about how can we do the humanities?"
How can we give people the basic scaffold of say American History?
"And then I think it would be really interesting to see how we can do things like creative writing, where people are doing projects and maybe they can peer review each others essays and things like that."
I think that there is a whole universe that we are just beginning to explore.
Tom:
Well we look forward to your exploration.
"Then, it is simply a question of, are your risky or you're unrisky? it's more complex than that."
"So, as an example of risk and risk perception and acceptance we can take a look at Facebook. this was a firm started by a college student in the U.S. in 2004 that was based initially on an idea that he had in high school. he'd launched this social networking platform at Harvard."
"Within two weeks, had half the student body signed up."
Quickly grew that to 30 other colleges in the region.
Moved to Silicon Valley.
"Partnered with Sean Parker of Napster, and really began to grow in scale the firm."
"They were able to go out and successfully raise some venture capital in the context of, initially,"
Angel Investment.
"And then later, larger traditional VC funding at evaluation of $100 million shortly after the firm was launched."
"So, very rapid growth."
"They continued to grow the firm and expanded it into serving high school students, and expanded their feature side as well of photo sharing."
"They then raised significant rounds of funding thereafter, and had a much greater val uation."
"Shortly before this, the firm was viewed as being worth $100 million based on future profit potential, and now they are over $500 million."
"And they were supporting anyone with an email account, and so they have grown from the college niche to high school, to now anyone that wanted to be a member."
"They then were offered a $750 million to be acquired, to be bought, to be owned by Viacom, and Mark"
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"Earlier that summer, they had a $one billion."
"Shortly thereafter, Viacom attempted to acquire the company for 750 million."
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"A few months later, a billion dollar offer, declined."
"The following year, Microsoft $240 million investment for 1.6% of the company making Facebook worth $fifteen billion based on that investment."
"500 million members signed, and one billion in revenue achieved."
And all of that happened in a span of approximately six years.
"So, in that way, what we see is rapid growth and to grow the company at such a high scale. there were multiple opportunities to be bought and to be acquired that were turned down, and the expectation of the Facebook team is that there were greater upside ahead."
"So, with that, when we look at risk it's easy to be risky when the stakes are low."
"But, when you are working in a high stake situation, we want to think about, well, again what are we risking?"
Is it financial?
Is it safety?
Is it ethics? so all of these certainly play a role.
"Within entrepreneurs, there's not an element of, again, seeking risk but it's more about perception and capability and what they see as a relative return."
"So, when we look at entrepreneurial motivation this is certainly central to understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions and how they perceive risk."
And there are three factors involved with that.
And then you only have one kid.
"If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now."
"Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage: being useful to humans."
"Like, here is a graph of cow population."
And here is a graph of elephant population.
"Elephants, if you had just inserted yourselves in the human life like cows did you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies conspiring against the humans."
"And then you could have risen up and destroyed us, and made an awesome elephant world, and elephant cars, and elephant planes."
"It would've been so great, but no...you gotta be pregnant for 22 months and just have one kid."
So annoying!
"Best wishes, John Green."
But back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred.
"Historians don't know for sure, of course, because there are no written records."
But they love to make guesses.
"Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture even though it was more work, or abundance gave people more leisure to experiment with domestication or planting originated as a fertility rite - or as some historians have argued - people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol."
"Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying:"
"""A wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of some wise, old savage"""
"Off-topic: but in will know in the coming weeks, that the definitions of ""savage"" tends to be ""not me""."
"Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all, but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more."
"Like, early hunter/gatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted."
"And when you find something that makes food, you want to do more of it."
Unless it is this food.
Then you want to do less of it.
I kind of wanna to spit it out.
That's much better.
"So, early farmers who would find the most successful forms of wheat and plant them, and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like,"
"""You know what would be awesome?"
"More food!"""
"Like, on this topic we have evidence that more than 13,000 years ago humans in Southern Greece were domesticating snails"
"In the Franchthi Cave there is a huge pile of snail shells, most of them are larger than current snail, suggesting that people who ate them were selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious."
"Snails make excellent domesticated food, by the way, because A, surprisingly nutritious, and B, they are easy to carry since they came in their own suitcases."
"And C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters."
That's not really a revolution.
"This is what white light would have done, this is a two-slit interference pattern."
This is what red light would have done.
"Red light is a narrow bandwidth of wavelengths, well-defined black lines, light plus light give darkness, well-defined maxima, and the blue -- notice that the separation between the dark lines and therefore also the separation between the bright lines is substantially smaller."
Because blue light has a wavelength of about 4500 Angstroms and red light roughly 6500.
So there's a big difference.
"And so white light would then give you the superposition of all these colors, and so you don't really get a very nice interference pattern of dark areas and bright areas, because all the colors begin to overlap and each live a life of their own."
What I can do with sound and what I did with water and what I have done with laser light
I can also do with radio electromagnetic waves.
With radar -- we have a 10-gigahertz transmitter here that we have used earlier in this course.
And so I will now show you that with radar you can also show interference patterns and the calculation that you see there are absolutely identical.
"The only thing I want to remind you of, that the approximation when you know capital L that the tangent theta is roughly the same as the sine of theta is only true for small angles."
"5 degrees is fine, 10 degrees is fine, but by the time that you reach 50, 60 or 70 degrees that approximation is not true."
So then you really have to take the tangent of theta.
"That's no problem because you first calculate what theta is, because that equation is correct, and then you can calculate always where X is, but then you use the tangent and not the sine."
So these are approximations which hold for small angles.
"And so if now we look at a 10-gigahertz transmitter, that means we have two transmitters, one here and one here."
And their separation D is 23 centimeters.
You see them here.
This is where they are.
"Here's one and here's the other, 23 centimeters apart."
At 10 gigahertz the wavelength is 3 centimeters.
You can confirm that.
The speed is speed of light.
Lambda is the speed of light divided by frequency.
That gives you the wavelength.
And we have here at a distance
"L which is 120 centimeters, we have here a receiver and a track, so this is X equals 0 and here we can move it along X and so you can calculate now at what angles seen from this point there will be a maximum there."
Theta 0 is obvious.
Right here there will be a maximum.
"The two waves, the distance between them is zero, R2 - R1 is 0."
So they will constructively interfere.
"But there is another angle, theta 1, for which again there will be constructive interference."
"Well, let me read the FBI press release, and you can respond to how they describe it."
"And we want to bring Angela Davis in, as well."
"This was their press release yesterday describing the May 2nd, 1973, shooting."
"They said, ""*On May 2, 1973, Chesimard and a pair of accomplices *"
*were stopped by two troopers for a motor vehicle violation on the New Jersey Turnpike. *
"*At the time, Chesimard—a member of the violent revolutionary activist organization known as the Black Liberation Army—*"
"*was wanted for her involvement in several felonies, including bank robbery.*"
*Chesimard and her accomplices opened fire on the troopers. *
"*One officer was wounded, his partner—Trooper Foerster—was shot and killed at point-blank range. *"
*One of Chesimard's accomplices was killed in the shoot-out and the other was arrested and remains in jail.*
"*Chesimard fled but was apprehended.*"""
That's their statement yesterday.
LH:
Right.
"Also in their statement that I read, the superintendent of state police claimed that Assata Shakur took the Officer Foerster's weapon and shot him while he was on the ground."
There is not one scintilla of evidence at the trial attesting to that.
"In fact, as I was saying before, she was incapable of lifting her hands, much less firing a weapon."
"Now, you asked what is the reason for this allegation at this time."
"We have to remember that 10 years ago,  a little over 10 years ago, the then-governor of the state of New Jersey, former Governor Christie Todd Whitman, she had issued and posted a $1 million bounty for Assata Shakur."
Today it has been doubled.
"But we believe that putting Ms. Chesimard, putting Assata Shakur on the FBl's 10 most wanted list is designed to inflame the public and to characterize her as a terrorist, when none of the acts alleged relates to terrorism."
"In fact, of all of the charges that have been leveled against her in New York, case after case, she was acquitted, or the charges were dismissed."
There was insufficient evidence to support any of the charges.
AG:
"Well, let's just—in 1971, armed robbery case was dismissed; 1971, she was acquitted of bank robbery; 1972, hung jury; 1972, kidnap of drug dealer, acquitted; and then several other cases dismissed."
"Angela Davis, you're in Chicago right now to give a major address tonight at the University of Chicago."
"Can you talk about this news of Joanne Chesimard, Assata Shakur, being—now being put on the top 10 wanted terrorists list, the first woman ever to be put on this list?"
ANGELA DAVlS:
"Well, first of all, it was a major shock to hear that Assata Shakur has become the first woman to be added to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list and then to learn that they're adding another million dollars to the reward, the bounty really."
It seems to me that this act incorporates or reflects the very logic of terrorism.
I can't help but think that it's designed to frighten people who are involved in struggles today.
"Forty years ago seems as if it were a long time ago, four decades; however, in the 21st century, at the beginning of the 21st century, we're still fighting around the very same issues— police violence, healthcare, education, people in prison, and so forth."
It was an extremely painful delivery for my wife.
The doctor rushed the whole process so he could go sailing.
"My daughter is 37 now; but wherever we go, she is always the last to leave the house."
"And whenever we go somewhere by car, she is always the last one to get out of the car."
I think she is still angry for having been rushed at birth.
In the Front Line
"For example, when my son was born I had to fight very hard to be there."
Somebody had decided that it would not good.
"And after he was born, I wasn't allowed to hold him in my arms, because I had walked in from the street."
Decisions like these.
That is bio-politics.
"What do those people think, who make such decisions?"
I remember a book: a thick book written by an American journalist.
"Its title was 'Eleni', which is about his ordeal trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order."
"She was shot to death in the Greek Civil War but before it happened, she had looked for someone to help his son escape the country."
And the whole book is about how he is trying to find out who signed his mother's execution order.
And he believes that he is going to kill the person.
"However, when he finds the old man the only thing he does is to spit him in his face and with that the story was over."
"Well, whoever signed the order to have Agi Gereb imprisoned, I would like to spit in their face."
I've never felt as outraged in my entire life as I felt when I heard this story.
There can't be any more unjust and cruel misunderstanding than this.
"It's as if Hungary had regressed to dark, medieval times."
"'Malleus maleficarum' was a book in the medieval ages, which was used in the systematic persecution of witches, by which they made a distinction between witches and non-witches."
It is the same dark force that was used by the Dominicans to persecute those whom they wished to accuse as witches.
"The harm that is done by obstetrics, by a doctor who works in a mechanical and dogmatic way, may go unnoticed for 20, 25 or 30 years after a person's birth."
"Since the harm done by obstetrics cannot be implied immediately, it is even harder to recognize than the situation was in Semmelweis' case."
So this is where those psychologists who know prenatal psychology should stand up and say:
"'Ok, perhaps both mother and child will live, but it is very likely that the child will need 20 years of psychotherapy 20 or 30 years from now, just because we are not listening to Leboyer or Agi Gereb.'"
"If there is any kind of tension around a child's birth, it is something that a whole generation will pay for within15-20 years."
"So the sooner there is some kind of solidarity and cooperation between obstetrician and midwives, the better it is."
"Michel Odent, who has visited me on a few occasions, and we have given several lectures together."
"He has stated several times, without any reservations, that everything he knows about births, as an obstetrician, he has learned from midwives."
"But it's green, we did teach them about traffic lights, and next to a lock, a metaphor."
"So even if they don't get it totally right, its sort of placement and the various things that it conveys, they might get close enough to say, well, it probably means that this is better somehow."
So they're able to bootstrap conceptually just up enough.
"Or another example, this one more visual."
"We bring them in and we say, what does this application do?"
"And they're going to say, it's very pretty."
"And then they're going to say, I don't know, because while this icon is pretty, also I think, did you work on this one?"
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
ALEX FAABORG:
All right.
"For the designer in the room who worked on this, I'm sorry."
"It's a great icon, but it does not convey to the user in this test chamber with access to no other knowledge, what it actually does."
"It is a great application, though."
"It's shipped on all the devices you guys have, you should check it out."
I use it everyday.
This is Currents.
So what does this app do?
They're not going to know.
"So I would argue that success in these situations, it doesn't have to do with their intelligence, it has to do with access to information."
Is that information embodied in the thing that they're using?
"So quickly you're thinking, all right, well, what if I don't have this underground testing facility?"
That sounds really expensive.
"And that's true, and this is controversial, it's especially controversial for any user researchers in the room, or user researchers watching later."
"But I would argue while it's really, really useful to have access to user researchers, you don't absolutely have to rely on them."
"You could just start running user tests in your own head, basically short-term amnesia."
"What you have to do is you have to kind of encapsulate your mind, you have to start thinking, forgetting the things that you know about your interface, try to look at it with fresh eyes, try to think, OK, I've never seen this thing before, which is hard because you have seen it before, really, really hard."
"But if you can do that, if you can look at it with fresh eyes and try to have all the assumptions fall away that you've already built up, then you're able to do that kind of user test just on yourself quickly right then."
"And if you're just regularly doing that, it's going to really improve your applications."
I think this is one of the most important things that I can convey.
"But obviously, you're going to be more familiar with the underlying implementation because you are literally building it."
"In the case of a clock, you are probably intimately familiar with each of the gears and how they fit together and all of these details, but you have to just"
The middle part (alto) is mostly for extend harmonization
Imagine a string group is like a hamburger.
The violins are the beef. the cellos are the bread. the violas are like vegetables.
Not the most important but weird without them.
Continue with the metaphor or the burger.
Improve the taste of the burger means improvement of the ingredients
"Breads have similar taste anyways. so people will mostly focus on the beef, so vege-like violas are ignored"
Now you can cook beef in different ways. even breads can served with butter or soup
Greens?
Eat them raw.
This cycle that happens over and over centuries  makes the situation now viola is facing
There are lots of composers in the world who loves and plays the viola
Here are some examples
Our first example is J.S. Bach
His 5th son is also a composer
He recalled that his dad loves the viola
"Well, J.S. Bach is the father of music and he knows how to play all the strings and keyboard instruments but he sits the viola section when he plays the string quartet"
"He composed 6 string quintet with these quintets, he added the 2nd viola  to enhance the texture of the pieces"
Bach said he loves the sound and the volume of the viola
Our 2nd example is Mozart
Mozart is well known for writing nice sections for violas in his quartets
He wrote a Violin and Viola concerto to his mom
During the premiere of this concerto
Mozart plays the viola and let his dad plays the violin
This is not because the viola part is easier
Both parts have many similar passages and difficulties
But Mozart still chose to play the viola there is no evidence to prove why he did that so I think Mozart secretly loves the viola
There are more famous composers who had play the viola
"However, there are no famous violists so there is no composers to write songs for the viola then there is no pieces to train violists as a result, there is no famous violists"
The theory is similar when you find a job the job requires you to have experiences but you have no job to gain experiences
Paganini is known as one of the most virtuous violinists
"He did try swap from playing the violin to the viola and he knows that there is no good pieces for viola so he paid a composer, Berlioz, to write him a  concerto to show off his viola skills"
NlCHOLAS CARR:
You're saying that having no spaces between words wasn't bad?
PETER NORVlG:
Yeah that uh
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Well let me correct one thing.
It wasn't Maryanne Wolfe who said that.
It was actually me.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay
NlCHOLAS CARR:
So don't blame her if that was ridiculous.
PETER NORVlG:
Excuse us Maryanne.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"But she did say that she worries that the kind of intensive decision making and problem solving that now goes along with reading in a hypertext multimedia environment, could return us more to our decoding method of reading and steal away our ability to make deep interpretations of text."
"But, no, I think actually that's incorrect about having no spaces between words."
"I mean, and this is going to get a little esoteric, but up til a thousand years ago there were no spaces between words and also there was no silent reading."
And the reason there was not silent reading is because it was really hard to figure out where one word ended and one began so you had to read it out loud and it was only after.
"So I think it was a very cognitive stress, cognitively intense process and it was only after you had spaces that you saw the emergence of silent reading and the kind of personal reading and deep reading that went along with it."
"So I thing that shows us that if you return a lot of cognitive juggling to the act of reading and whether it is just your frontal cortex flashing a little to click a link or whether you have ads running down the side of a column or all sorts of other things, you are kind of overloading our short term memory, which has a very small capacity, and you're making it much harder to comprehend the reading, understand it at a deep level and make all the interpretive leaps and jumps, give interpretive reading its richness."
PETER NORVlG:
So you're saying the Chinese and Japanese people can't do deep reading?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
I think they can.
"You're talking there about a completely different alphabet, and it is true actually that studies show that it is more cognitively intense simply because of the huge number of letters, so reading is different in those languages, the act of reading is cognitively different in those readings, with those languages than it is with English."
And there's even differences between like English and Italian because of the way the words either match up with the way you pronounce them or not.
"So all, even small changes in language or the way words are presented does have cognitive implications."
PETER NORVlG:
So I guess that is one of the things that always struck me.
"To write the book, I think you do an excellent job talking about the plasticity of mind to say that this theory that we are born with what we have and that is it, is not proven to be true that we do change all the time, that the technologies we deal with change us that our experiences change us and our mind is always growing and altering."
"But some of the places it seems, like it's just too much kind of scare quotes."
[crowd laughing]
AYE.
It's approved.
[crowd cheers and claps]
"In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment may have had an effect."
"So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores."
"And then the other treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I seriously might do."
"After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about whether or not this will work."
I guess we'll just have to wait and see the results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning.
"Speaking of which, that's the dependent variable."
In the next lesson you'll learn how to formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DOUGLAS CROCKFORD:
Thanks everybody for coming back for what turns out to be Scene 6:
Loopage [in the Crockford on JavaScript series].
"Before we begin, I recently read a white paper: some guys comparing two application platforms, one written in C++ and one written in Java."
"They went through the features, comparing them and deciding which of the platforms was better."
"When they got to garbage collection, they said garbage collection is a programmer convenience."
But then they evaluated the two systems based on how large a convenience it appeared to be.
"They measured the number of dispose instructions in the C++ code and found that there wasn't a lot of that, and then determined that it was more than a programmer convenience, which was completely wrong."
That's not what garbage collection is.
Garbage collection is a reliability mechanism.
Having garbage collection means you're not going to have dangling pointer errors and all these other hazards.
It also means there's a large class of wonderful algorithms that you can consider that are really too dangerous to consider if you don't have garbage collection.
So they completely screwed up their analysis.
"Basically their conclusion was: if you're into C++, you can feel good about not understanding Java."
That turns out to be a really bad way to think about things.
"You really should be making decisions based on good information and deep understanding, and very often that's not what we do."
But that's not what I'm going to be talking about tonight.
I'm going to be talking about loops.
Here's a loop statement.
"It says loop and you've got a block, and as you would expect, all of the statements within the block will get repeated over and over and over until something happens."
"JavaScript doesn't have a statement that looks quite like that, which"
What?
Roomate?!
Did something happen?
"No, I'm fine."
Voiceover:
"Let's say I am an economist, and I am curious about whether, in general, things are getting more expensive or not, and if they are getting expensive, by how much?"
"The way I'd approach that is,"
"I'd think of, what are just a bunch of goods and services that the average person would buy?"
"I would think up some type of basket of goods and services, and I would try to weight that basket, based on how people actually spend their money, so I would say, ""Okay, 40% of people's money"
"""on average are spent on housing;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on transportation;"
"""maybe another 10% is spent on food,"" and I would go out into the market, and I would try to take an average of what these things cost, and I would sample a bunch of products, a bunch of services, so I could get a decent average of that."
"This is not a simple thing to do, but I am an economist, and I am serious about trying to calculate it."
"Let's say that when I take that weighted average of all of the stuff, I just come up with a number."
"I'm not giving you the details of how it's actually calculated, but to give you the idea of what they are doing."
I get a number.
"To rent, to buy or lease your average automobile; to lease your average apartment; to buy your average servings of food for a given family; all the rest;"
"let's say I come up with, that costs, and I'm making up a number here,"
"let's say that it costs $20,000."
My basket of goods and services.
Just based on the way that I've weighted it.
This is all happening in year 1.
This is in year 1.
"I'm curious whether between year 1 and, let's say, year 5, and year 5, whether things got more expensive."
"I'll take that same basket of goods and services, so, basket of goods and services, and I'll try to figure out what is their weighted average cost in year 5?"
"This is a lot harder than it might sound right now, because the baskets of goods and services change."
"If computers get faster, do you use the same computer, or do you think about what the average computer is, which would now be a better computer?"
"If most people's TVs got bigger, do you use the same TV in year 1 and year 5 or do you adjust for what is now the average TV, which is now bigger?"
"If houses have gotten bigger on average, do you use the same house, or would you use the average house?"
"There's a whole bunch of areas here that you can really tweak, and these are actually huge subjects of debate, on what is the actual increase in cost."
"Let's say that you're able to do this in what you think is a pretty reasonable way, and you find that the same basket of goods, adjusted for things like technology and all of the rest, now costs $22,000."
"Your takeaway from here is that the same things that cost $20,000, the things that gave you the same standard of living in year 1, to get that same standard of living in year 5, you now need to spend 10% more."
"Likewise, the things behind you,  those are redshifted, and those look like they move more slowly."
Now that's all 99.9% but it's not faster than the speed of light.
The idea of warp drive is something that physicists have absolutely  thought about.
"In what we call Einstein's  Special Theory of Relativity, it is simply impossible."
That was his 1905 theory about space and time being together.
But then in 1916 Einstein said that space and time can be warped.
So we realized more recently  that you can imagine warping space-time in a little bubble around you  and have that bubble move in such a way that to an outside observer it looks like  you're moving faster than the speed of light.
"However it looks, we're not sure, but it looks like this  is not actually possible in the real world."
To make this happen would require tremendous amounts of energy and some negative amounts of energy.
So you would need an enormous  space-time warping field around you and we don't know how to make the kind of negative energy that it would require.
So the smart money is that there is  no warp drive in the real laws of physics.
"But we don't yet have a proof, we're working on it you should check back  to see where things go."
"The next question is, ""If you did travel  faster than the speed of light,"
"""would you be able to visit the past"
"""or if an object were moving faster than the speed of light,"
"""would it look like it was in the past?"""
And this is a great question because this goes right to the heart of Einstein's way of looking  at space and time versus Newton's way  of looking at space and time.
"Before Einstein came along, Isaac Newton  had laid down the law about space and time."
"They were both fixed,  separate, and absolute."
"And what that means is that if you know  that it's 2 pm right here, right now, you can say it is also 2 pm on Alpha Centauri 4 lightyears away."
"It's also 2 pm in the Andromeda Galaxy, and so forth."
That's Newton's way of looking at the world but then Einstein comes along  and says there's no such thing as what time it is right now in some far away place.
"It's not that there's no such thing, it's more that it depends on who's asking the question."
"So to you, there's something  called 2 pm on Alpha Centauri but to somebody else moving  at some speed relative to you, what counts as 2 pm on Alpha Centauri is completely different."
"And what that means is  if you could travel faster than light, in Einstein's universe — and he says  you can't and he's probably right, you probably can't."
"But if you could, imagine you said,"
"""I was able to move so fast that I got to Alpha Centauri 5 minutes from now."
"""It only takes me 5 minutes to get there."""
"What that means is that, from someone else's point of view, you went from here, now, to Alpha Centauri some time before you left, some time in the past."
"So according to Einstein,  if he has the last word and we're never sure about that,  if he has the last word, then the ability to go faster than the speed of light is the same as the ability  to go backwards in time."
You could go faster  than the speed of light and come back and you could come back before you left.
Now we don't think that there's anything that actually does that in the universe.
"Hi guys, this is another video from LifeSlGNS."
"Just a quick one this time, erm it's May so May the Fourth be with you guys."
I hope your all well.
Erm this is just going to be a quick one saying that I am sure you are all aware that LifeSlGNS is a user led organisation.
And by that I mean that we rely solely on donations from you guys and we are extremely lucky to have such generous people who are willing to give us all these donations to help us carry on our work.
"And during this month we are going to thank every single person who donates £5 or more within the UK, sorry guys it can't be further."
"By sending them, one of our shiny new magnets."
Yeah!
"This is what they are, this is what they look like."
Little magnet.
"They've been designed by our Wedge, and they have the brand new images and motto on them."
So it's a little Lighthouse.
"To get your hands on them, basically you just have to donate £5 or more during May and when your donation is received we will email you within 24 hours of your request to get your postal address, which is only going to be used for sending you your gift and then it will be deleted, so we won't spam you to death."
"So if you can possibly spare a fiver this month please consider just donating five pounds to us, it will do a really good deed for us guys and really help us out."
So pretty please?
(laughs) And it will be a lovely decoration for your fridge so who wouldn't want this?
"That's it guys, thank you."
"And I hope you are all having a wonderful May, bye."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Secretary Salazar:
"Thank you very much, Neal Muholland, and thank you to all of the members of the National Parks"
Foundation for your outstanding work and for making this day possible.
Thank you for the work you do to protect America's natural heritage and its culture.
On behalf of the Department of the Interior and the National
"Parks Service and my colleagues on President Obama's cabinet, we are honored that you are all here with us tonight to celebrate this great American holiday tradition."
"Seventy years ago this month, just weeks after the bombing of"
"Pearl Harbor, in those dark days,"
President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined here together in the White House to light the national Christmas tree.
"During those dark days, President Roosevelt called on the nation to view the lighting of the tree as a reminder that we set our faith in human love and in God's care for us."
"Tonight let this tree remind us that in all times, the light of love and good will shines brightly across America and around the world."
"This occasion is also special for all of us, because we are gathered here in Presidents Park, one of the 397 national parks under the care of the service, and here we light our nation's spirit of peace, hope and joy for the holidays."
"Now on this remarkable night in these remarkable times, it is with great honor that I introduce someone who never rests, someone who never tires, someone who never quits, someone who is a champion for American peace and prosperity for all of its citizens, the 44th President of the the United"
"States of America, Barack Obama!"
"I see a lot of people doing this, recognizing a failure in my position of the text there."
A bunch of scientists at the beginning of the last century wanted to figure this out.
"They were a bunch of Germans, they wanted to figure out how to order things and group things, and how we do that."
"They call this idea of order, they considered it order or rightness, they called it gestalt."
Here's an example of some gestalt principles at work.
You can see here how some very simple changes in the structure of the data make it so much easier to process on the right.
"Alex talked about these hierarchies of information and how, since we can't change the algorithms in people's brains, we have to speed things up by structuring the data."
"Well, these gestalt principles are how we structure the data."
"Now, I'm not going to go through all of the principles here."
"I'd recommend that you read the Wikipedia article on the topic, it's great."
I could have just read it and done well.
But I've distilled some of these ideas into two practical principles that you can put to work immediately when you're evaluating designs.
Here's the first one.
This is the thing that I wish that people had told me on the very first day of design school.
It's line stuff up.
That's it.
Everything should be lined up with something unless it has a good reason not to.
"So even if elements are at the very opposite sides of the screen and they're almost aligned, line them up."
"If we don't do it, then our subconscious brains are spending precious cycles trying to figure out, why are those things not lined up?"
Does it mean something?
Does it not mean something?
"It's almost like I'd compare it to a memory leak in your software, where something's going on, you're not exactly sure, but you're wasting your resources."
Let's line that back up.
That's better.
"So even stuff that isn't on the same screen, let's say three or four screens later, you've got something that's maybe in this case, a little bit above halfway down the page."
Line it up.
"Even though it doesn't seem like people will be able to make that association, and consciously they certainly won't, our visual processing systems are using that information to know how to decode this."
"Now I might also point out, if you do want to bring emphasis to something, then not lining it up is a really great way to do it."
You can see in these suggested paragraphs right here how just pulling one line out of alignment gives you a bunch of information about what's the most important and a lot of structure.
Here's the second big idea.
Design the spaces.
"Now, this is a little bit hard to do because again, our conscious brain is really good at examining objects in the foreground."
Enhancing the size of the student body means we need more faculty to teach them.
"We hired five new faculty last year, eleven new faculty joined us this year, and we're out recruiting for even more faculty to join us next year."
These new faculty add to our expertise and they add an energy that's revitalizing the College of Business Administration.
We believe that we are shaping and molding the next set of ethical leaders for Nebraska and the world.
"As our enrollments increase, we are taking steps to keep all these new students highly engaged."
"For example, all freshmen now take a course that's designed to introduce them to the rigors of college work, introduce them to the various majors in business, to leadership, and to help connect them to fellow students so they have a sense of community here in the College of Business Administration."
Many people say we're a large college that feels small.
And I like that.
"Hi I'm Clark Cunningham, are you from Germany."
"I think it was a fantastic way for me personally, I'm from out of state so it's kind of hard for me to get to know people."
"It was a really great way for me to experience new cultures, get to meet people."
"We're all doing something that's new to us, we're all in this new environment and I thought it was fantastic."
The University of Nebraska is a city within a city.
Get to know as many people as you possibly can.
Speakers like alumnus Aaron Davis and Husker legend Dr. Tom Osborne speak to our freshman class.
They stress the importance of meeting new people and both are examples of the rich traditions of this university.
This fall we rolled out a new major in supply chain management.
We also revised our management major to include a new track in entrepreneurship.
"Finally, we started a new minor in business designed especially for non-business majors from all the other colleges around the campus."
And it's been very well received.
"This summer, I attended the CBA Nebraska at Oxford Program along with 71 students from the University of Nebraska."
"The program, held at one of the most prestigious schools in the world, is the largest study abroad program at the university and has flourished over the last 24 years."
"All these great things happening here in the College of Business Administration would not be possible without the support of you, our friends, our alums, and our business partners."
"In fact, we've just wrapped up our annual CBA partnership summit and advisory board meetings."
More than 170 individuals from all over the nation give of their time and talents serving on our 12 advisory boards.
We're fortunate to have such loyal volunteers who take an active interest in CBA.
"As you can see, it's a great time to be part of the College of Business Administration."
Thank you for your interest and support and I encourage you to continue to engage in our CBA community.
CBA's the place to be.
You'll be hearing more from me soon.

"When you quit smoking, it's like there's a good self on one side saying,"
"Oh, I made some new observation and I'm going to go straight to write a wiki article about it."
You can write about it but first you have to submit it to some say journals or conferences.
Go through the peer review process that is based on scientific merits and back and forth.
And then once it appears in some external link then you can write about that in the wiki entry. .
"The third of policy is abbreviated as NPOV, a neutral point of view."
"And unlike verifiability and no original research, neutral point of view is much harder to enforced, cuz it's not as."
Clear cut as to whether this policy is observed or not.
"But roughly speaking, it says that, if you read an article, you should not be able to tell."
What kind of people wrote it?
"For example, in U.S."
"Political articles, you should not be able to tell, is it a Democrat or a Republican who wrote this article?"
"So the article must appear as, as objective and neutral as possible to the point that you cannot easily identify the kinda label."
To the people who wrote this article.
There're also quite a few other mechanisms here including having a history page where a few people would click that page but you can always check that out.
Every single edit in the entire history of that hardcore is stored and you can check that for yourself.
There is also talk page for discussion among the contributors and the editors.
There is reputation system.
"If you enter using your ID then there's a reputation system of no ID, if you don't then there's a reputation system of the IP address."
"Later, in lecture thirteen we will talk about internet IP architecture but basically, this is the address of the device that you use to enter your articles."
And then there is a hierarchical community.
"There are many, many contributors."
And then there's a small set of people who are editors.
And then there is a even smaller subset of that who are more senior editors.
"And they form like, juries."
And they will debate and discuss and try to form rough consensus.
On articles where the contributors hold a very different opinions.
"And eventually, it can pop up to the highest level of committee to debate and discuss."
"So thanks to these policies and guidelines and thanks to these mechanisms, some of these challenges faced by Wikipedia has been quite successfully tackled."
"So now what we want to go into more detail is how this, this kind of committee operates."
And they operate it based on two kinds of mechanism.
"One is bargaining, and one is voting."
Prof:
"In 5 years' time, I wish each of these kids will probably have access to a cell phone that would be more powerful than the computer you own."
I would say that you can make the case that the future of the world depends on what they see on that cell phone.
"Will they be looking at trivia, pornography, incitations to violence?"
Although some of them get to look face-to-face at some of the world's greatest teachers speaking to them in the language that they can understand.
They can give them information they need to come out of the poverty to realize their true potential.
They might be in here.
"They might be the next Einstein or the next Gandhi, the person who will save the planet for our grandchildren."
How does that happen?
I can't make that happen.
"But, maybe, just maybe, we can."
"And, certainly today is a really exciting start."
"So, thank you to each of you."
(Applause)
this is representing the earth
Okay !! and this represents ... what do yo think?
"The moooon yes , our first challenge is how far apart are they"
like roughly.
Like roughly? about that much.
Okay.
I guess may be not that far about that far? yeah yeah may be that far.
"about like that? ha ha may be I guess, yes"
May be that may be that
like this far ?
"I feel its like here, somewhere right there?"
alright alright lets lets....
I am just going to stand here
Can I ?
Yeah yeah go ahead how does this far sounds like these are some images I found: on a Google image search for the earth and the moon diagrams that are not to scale are pretty common and I understand why we make them so you can show that detail without showing all that uninteresting space in between but they can have a problematic effect on learning because they give people the wrong idea about the relative proximities of things now if we want to talk about the distance between the Earth and the moon its actually...
its about here think about this.
It takes light one second to go from the earth to the moon takes eight minutes for light to travel to the Sun and four years to go to our nearest star then consider that there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy and as far as we know a hundred billion galaxies in the universe say universe truly is bigger than we can imagine and certainly bigger than we can draw to scale
"We are asking forgiveness from our Lord in these times to forgive our mistakes and to count us from His sincere servants we are not able to carry these days orders because shaytan and our ego are standing in our way so we are asking forgiveness and asking Allah SWT to send us more power to become better servants to Him from the first man until the last one order came to the children of Adam AS believe believe in Allah and believe in akhirat life this was the duty of 124,000 Prophets they came to warn people and to tell them this Kalimat, to call them to Allah"
"He told them not to concentrate on this dunya, but to concentrate on akhirat life when we check from Adam AS until Muhammad ASWS this is what they did in this century people are running not to mention the name of Allah from small groups to organizations to governments running to stop the name of Allah and heedless 21st century people are running after them"
Hick's law is more interesting.
It's about solving for time based off of the number of choices and probability.
"It's been proven that if you simplify the Ul, people are going to be able to click on things faster."
"So the argument of, why don't we just introduce a button for that?"
It's because it has cost.
It literally makes interface less efficient if people have to search against it.
"So equation here, you have the number of equally probable choices, which first of all, no interface is going to have equal probabilities, so this form's bad."
What you actually want is summation with the probability of each one individually.
"And based off of that, you can determine when you have something lined up with others, what the access time is going to be as people try to locate the one that they're"
looking for and choose.
So the combination of things like Fitt's law and Hick's law goes into the field of cognitive modeling.
"And basically what this is, is predicting a performance assuming highly trained users."
"So unlike the self-describing section, here you're assuming that people know what everything is."
And it's purely about access time and how quickly they can target the control and get to it.
So a lot of this work is actually done.
"At NASA Ames, there's a really good group doing it right next to the Google campus, and they're primarily doing it for fighter pilots, actually."
"This is a simulator of the F35, and in this case, you obviously have really highly trained users because they know what every control does, and it's purely about visual access time and small controls and proximity to other small controls."
"But even for a standard interface, a mobile application or a desktop application, you could do this type of modeling to try to make sure things are super efficient, looking at the metrics."
So that's how to build great interfaces.
"But the things we talked about, self-describing, basically the user building a mental model and sort of simulating in their head how stuff works, preventing errors, making users fast, the idea of cognitive modeling."
That's how to make something really easy to use.
Show an example.
This is really easy to use.
"If you know you have to get to the other side, we talked about doors a bit, you know how to get there."
"You can assume the thing rotates, being inside a circle."
"There's no mode errors, because it only rotates in one direction, and it's easy to use."
It also looks like a human cheese slicer.
It is not a happy door.
"So that leads us to the second part, which is visual design."
Here's Christian Robinson.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So not to contradict you, but I think that the design of that is actually really quite appropriate."
"Now for all but the longest wavelengths, a radio telescope is just a dish, much like the main mirror of an optical telescope."
"But because radio waves are so much longer than visible light-waves, the surface of the dish doesn't have to be nearly as smooth as the surface of a mirror."
And that's the reason why it's so much easier to build a large radio telescope than it is to build a large optical telescope.
"Also, at radio wavelengths, it is much easier to do interferometry."
"That is, to increase the level of detail that can be seen by combining the light from two separate telescopes, as if they were part of a single, giant dish."
"The Very Large Array in New Mexico, for example, consists of 27 separate antennas, each measuring 25 metres across."
"Now each antenna can be moved around individually, and in its most extended configuration the virtual dish mimicked by the array measures 36 kilometres across."
So what does the Universe look like in the radio?
"Well, for a start our Sun shines very brightly at radio wavelengths."
So does the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
But there's more.
Pulsars are very dense stellar corpses that emit radio waves only into a very narrow beam.
"In addition, they rotate at speeds of up to several hundred revolutions per second."
"So in effect, a pulsar looks like a rotating radio lighthouse."
And what we see from them is a very regular and fast sequence of very short radio pulses.
Hence the name.
The radio source known as Cassiopeia A is in fact the remnant of a supernova that exploded in 17th century.
"Centaurus A, Cygnus A and Virgo A are all giant galaxies that pour out huge amount of radio waves."
Each galaxy is powered by a massive black hole at its centre.
Some of these radio galaxies and quasars are so powerful that their signals can still be detected from a distance of 10 billion light-years.
"And then there's the faint, relatively short-wavelength radio hiss that fills the entire Universe."
This is known as the cosmic microwave background and it is the echo of the Big Bang.
The very afterglow of the hot beginnings of the Universe.
Each and every part of the spectrum has its own story to tell.
"At millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths, astronomers study the formation of galaxies in the early Universe and the origin of stars and planets in our own Milky Way."
But most of this radiation is blocked by water vapour in our atmosphere.
"To observe it, you need to go high and dry."
"To Llano de Chajnantor, for example."
"At five kilometres above sea level, this surrealistic plateau in northern Chile is the construction site of ALMA: the Atacama Large Millimetre Array."
"When completed in 2014, ALMA will be the largest astronomical observatory ever built."
"64 antennas, each weighing 100 tonnes, will work in unison."
"Giant trucks will spread them out over an area as large as London to increase the detail of the image, or bring them close together to provide a wider view."
Photoshop.
"So here at the capture sharpening stage you can often just stick with the defaults but if you do want a photo to look sharper here on your screen at this stage, here's how to work with the detail panel's sharpening controls."
The first thing you wanna do is set up your previews.
"You have your preview of your sharpening -a live preview, here at the top of the digital panel."
"And if you don't see it, you can click this black triangle to open the Preview area."
I can set this
Preview to any part of the photo by clicking on the target and then clicking on the area of the photo that I wanna see in this preview.
And I can even come in and Click and Drag to move that around.
"By default, this small preview is set to one-"
-to-one view.
And that's really important because you cannot accurately preview sharpening unless you're viewing the photo at one-to-one.
And that's also true in the other preview that you have which is out in the Image Window.
Your Image Window has to be set to one-to-one view as well in order for you to judge your sharpening here.
"So, I'm gonna go up to the Navigator panel and I'll click the One-to-One button there."
And then I'll use this small square in the Navigator panel to drag the image in the image window to the part of the photo that I wanna see as I'm sharpening.
"Now, let's talk about what sharpening does."
Sharpening looks for edges in a photo.
"The edges between dark and light tones, like this edge here at the corner of the building."
"And then when you sharpen, that adds light pixels on one side of the edge and dark pixels on the other, those are called Sharpening Halos."
These halos increased contrast at the edges and that creates the illusion of sharpness.
"To see that better, I'm gonna go over to the sharpening settings and I'm gonna drag the amount slider way over to the right."
"And, then I'm also going to zoom in, I normally wouldn't do this when I'm sharpening but I want you to see that along that edge, there are some white pixels and along the other side of the edge, some dark pixels."
And those are the halos I just mentioned that create the illusion of sharpness.
"This amount slider determines the strength of sharpening, how brighter, how dark the sharpening halos are."
"The next slider, the Radius slider determines the thickness or spread of the sharpening halos."
"How far out from an edge a sharpening effect extends so you can see that if I drag the Radius slider to the right keeping your eye on these halos, they're going to move out from that edge as I increase radius."
"And if I decrease radius, those halos go back in toward the edge."
"Now if the Radius slider is up too high, you're gonna see a kind of a ghostly glow on the edge of the building when I go back in to a one-to-one view."
I'm gonna do that now.
Coming up to the Navigator panel and clicking One-to-One.
So you can see I've still got that glow along the edge of the building and that means that my Radius slider is up too high.
"So, I'm gonna drag it down."
"So anyway, that's sort of what I wanted to say on productivity."
"Yeah, question?"
AUDlENCE:
"Does higher productivity translate into more income, or more income for individuals who will buy stuff [INAUDlBLE] taking more leisure?"
JON GRUBER:
Because basically the point is think of our economy as a pie.
"That basically the idea is let's think of you have a start up, and your start up is such that you can make this product, and you could make $1 million a year with 10 workers."
You could make $1 million worth of stuff with 10 workers.
"So each of your workers takes home $100,000."
"Now imagine that you discover new technology which lets you, with the same amount of workers, make $2 million a year."
"Well, some of that you'll keep, but some of it you'll pay your workers more."
"So suddenly they have more money, because you've suddenly managed to make twice as valuable stuff with the same amount of resources."
So that's the situation which improves our standard of living.
Other questions about that?
Comments?
"OK, so the bottom line, coming back to sort of micro-theory we're talking about, is we have to think about production functions as having a productivity adjustment."
"Macro raises these big issues about sort of ultimately what determines our standard of living in this country, and how do we want to spend that money?"
"So, with that as background, we're now going to stop talking about production and move on to cost."
Cost is-- quite frankly this is perhaps my least favorite thing in the whole course.
"It's a little bit boring, but you need to understand how cost structure in a firm works to understand how firms make the decisions that ultimately get to be a lot more interesting again, so just sort of bear with me."
"Now, so we talked about costs, let's start with a couple of definitions."
"Basically, let's back up, where are we coming from?"
"I talked about what the firm's decision is, the firm has to maximize profits, which is revenues minus cost."
So we have to ask what are costs if we're going to make this profit maximizing decision.
"Well, costs are going to have a few components."
"The first component, costs are going to have really two major components-- fixed costs, and variable costs."
Fixed costs and variable costs.
Fixed costs are the costs of inputs that cannot be varied in the short-run.
"Remember, I said that the short-run is defined as a period over time which only some inputs can vary."
"Well, fixed costs are the costs of those inputs that can't vary in the short-run."
"Variable costs-- so that's like capital in the short-run-- variable costs are the cost of goods that can vary in the short run, that's like labor."
"So total costs is the sum of these two, so total costs equals fixed cost plus variable cost."
"When Einstein introduced the wormhole into his equations... he didn't think that anyone... could ever walk through one of these things... because, after all, you die in the process."
"Impossible as it may sound, experts think there may be... a way to travel through a wormhole... and live to tell about it."
"In principle, you can go right through... to another parallel universe."
If you go through again... you wind up on yet another parallel universe.
And if you go again and again and again... you wind up on repeated parallel universes.
"It's like going into an elevator and hitting the ""up"" button."
Each floor looks like a universe.
"Once again, however, there is a major drawback."
One problem is you don't know where you're going to wind up.
You'll wind up in a middle of a star... wind up in the middle of a planet.
It may ultimately prove impossible for individuals... to pass through a portal to a parallel universe... but there may be another way to save humankind.
"If the gateway is very small, like, for example, atomic in size... perhaps what we should do is send a seed, a nanobot... a microscopic robot through the gateway... containing the DNA, containing all the information... necessary to create a new civilization on the other side of the universe."
Where do we see that in nature?
Think of a tree.
A tree creates a seed.
The seed contains the DNA that it shoots out in all directions... capable of creating a new tree.
"The idea is that if an advanced civilization... in the future could assemble enough high-energy laser beams... they could, in theory, burn a hole in the fabric of space-time."
It's very difficult.
But we physicists have calculated that if you concentrate... enormous energy at a single point... to attain something called the Planck energy... the ultimate energy... space and time itself become unstable.
Little bubbles begin to form...
little bubbles that are perhaps portals... gateways to another universe.
"In this way, a microscopic pod or nanobot... containing humanity's DNA and the cosmic code of our world... can be transported to a parallel universe."
Faced with extinction... this could be humanity's last great hope.
"If we can't do it, it means the death of the universe."
"But if this incredible feat is achieved... our entire universe would be resurrected... and, like a phoenix, rise from the ashes."
"In other words, you are playing God."
This fantastic idea...
like the replay button on the universal iPod... could reset the cosmic concerto of human history... back to the beginning.
At least some kinds almost certainly exist.
Maybe the other kinds exist as well.
We just don't know.
"Only then, perhaps, will we be certain that there are parallel universes."
"Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters."
"The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline, over and over."
"Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers -- that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure, which is currently rated at a D minus."
"So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,"
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
"And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites."
"They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,"
"like risk and responsibility,"
"like peripetia and anagnorisis,"
"like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone."
"It's been great talking to you and get back to work, will you?"
(Applause)
The same statistic was run for female students.
"Again, I made up the data to illustrate the effect."
Females tended to apply predominantly for major B with 900 applications for major B and just 100 for major A.
The university accepted 80 out of 100 applications in major A and 180 out of 900 in major B.
Please tell me the rate of acceptance in percent for major A for the females student population.
I believe the first step I took at the Mechina was my first step towards success in life
"After you finish the Mechina, you have the tools to succeed later on in life, in the army, in everything that follows"
"I think this Mechina in general isn't a Pre-military Academy, but a preparatory academy for how to live life"
"When we thought about erecting an institution in the city we deliberated what kind of institution it should be, and we decided that this is what Am Yisrael really needs now"
I went to Rabbi Drukman and asked him who should lead the Mechina
He told me to call Rabbi Boaz [Sherman.
"They asked me to lead the Mechina, to found it"
I debated about it and in the end
I decided to go ahead with the idea
"We brought a bus from Ashkelon, some guys from here and there we told the guys we recruited:"
"""Guys, there will be a new Mechina here next year"""
It was a very special experience.
"We began with 30 guys, ""the pioneers"" who came to the Mechina."
They began the idea in a really nice way.
"We came to Kiryat Malachi we sought a place for the Mechina, though we couldn't find a suitable place so we rented an apartment and a storage area which would serve as our Beit Midrash."
"So this is some member of Rn, you want to construct this vector."
"Well, the linear combination that would get you this is"
literally a1 times e1 plus a2 times e2 plus all the way to an times en.
This scalar times this first column vector will essentially just get you-- what will this look like?
This will look like a1 and then you'd have a bunch of zeroes.
You'd have n minus 1 zeroes plus 0 and you'd have an a2 and then you'd have a bunch of zeroes.
"And then you'd keep doing that, and then you would have a bunch of zeroes, and then you would have an an."
"Obviously, by our definition of vector addition, you add all these things up, you get this guy right here."
"And it's kind of obvious, because this right here is the same thing as our identity matrix times a1."
I just wanted to expose you to that idea.
"Now, let's apply what we already know about linear transformations to what we've just learned about this identity matrix."
I just told you that I can represent any vector like this.
Let me rewrite it in maybe terms of x.
"I can write any vector x as a linear combination of the standard basis, which are really just the columns of the identity matrix."
"I can write that as x1 times e1 plus x2 times e2, all the way to xn times en."
"And remember, each of these column vectors right here,"
"like for e1, is just 1 in the first entry and then all the rest are zeroes. e2 is a 1 in the second entry and everything else is 0. e5 is a 1 in the fifth entry and everything else is 0."
"And this I just showed you, and this is a bit obvious from this right here."
"Now, we know that by definition, a linear transformation of x-- let me put it this way."
"A linear transformation of x, of our vector x, is the same thing as taking the linear transformation of this whole thing-- let me do it in another color-- is equal to the linear transformation of-- actually, instead of using L,"
let me use T.
I used L by accident because I was thinking linear.
"But if I were take the linear transformation of x, because that's the notation we're used to, that's the same thing as taking a linear transformation of this thing."
They're equivalent.
"So x1 times e1 plus x2 times e2, all the way to plus xn times en."
It's equivalent statements.
"Now, from the definition of linear transformations, we know that this is the same thing, that the transformation of the sum is equal to the sum of the transformation."
So this is equal to the transformation of x1 e1 plus the transformation of x2 e2 where this is just any linear transformation.
Let me make that very clear.
This is any linear transformation.
"By definition, linear transformations have to satisfy these properties."
"So the transformation times x2 e2, all the way to this transformation times this last entry, the scalar xn times my standard basis vector en."
"How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?"
"I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old, the thing that came to my mind was,"
"""How do you come into her world?"
Is she thinking about me?
"Is she thinking about others?"""
"Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies."
We had to basically step inside a body.
We had to see the world through her eyes.
"And so in the past many years, we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking."
"We can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with."
"This is my colleague, Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years."
"And you see there a happy five-month-old, a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world: his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare."
"What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment."
What is important and what is not.
"Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention."
You're watching a video -- those frames are separated by about a second -- through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.
"And we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing."
"In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism."
"So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl."
What are the children with autism doing?
"They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting."
"Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment."
"It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers."
"Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts -- you know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and you have physical height and weight."
"Well, we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement."
We sought children from the time they're born.
"What you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months."
"This is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart."
They start over here -- they love people's eyes -- and it remains quite stable.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
"Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic."
It's something very different.
"But unfortunately, half the reason why I wanted to make this video is because part of what he's saying, at least in my experience, a lot of guys don't understand."
"Ponytail makes the argument in one statement that the swimmers are broad-shouldered and flat-chested with little waists, and then in the other argument he's saying that they flatten them into stubs."
"And, see, that doesn't really make sense, Ponytail,"
"'cause on one hand you're saying it's their body type, and then on the other hand you're saying it's their attire."
Are they flattening their boobs or are they just flat-chested?
"You really don't know what that person looks like, is what you're saying."
"Girls are majestic fucking creatures, just like I said, Ponytail, and you have been tricked yet again by the optical illusion, in this case, of a swimsuit."
"I made a video on my blog channel awhile back about how to trick people into thinking you have big boobs, and basically gave a step-by-step tutorial on how to make your boobs go up to your neck and look gigantic, and you can do that the other way so that you can be good at sports, and it's called a sports bra."
"And in fact, when I was in college,"
"I actually had multiple people introduce themselves to me during the day, when I looked like a little kid, and then introduce themselves to me later at a party in a much different way, because they thought I was two different fucking people."
"And aside from the obvious hair/makeup thing going on, without fail, there was almost always a comment along the lines of,"
[DEEP VOlCE]
"""Whoa!"
"Where did those things come from?"""
[NORMAL VOlCE]
It's like guys don't understand how sports bras work.
"It's like boobs are fucking ghosts, and they're only real if they're in front of your face."
Have you ever tried running with two giant cantaloupes attached to your chest?
"No, you'll give yourself a black eye."
It fucking hurts when you're doing things with your boobies bouncing all over the place.
I'm sorry that it's not aesthetically pleasing to you.
"There is a time and a place for watching girls being sexual objects while doing something athletic, and it's called a strip club."
"So if you'd like to go there, you can go ahead and do that."
Sports bras make you look like you have no tits because you can't do shit with your titties bouncing all up in your face.
"We can't expect you to just know all the secrets of our top-secret titty club, but that doesn't mean that they're not there."
"How dare you, Creepy-Facial-Hair Ponytail, call someone broad-shouldered and flat-chested when you probably have no fucking idea what her titties look like."
So I'm gonna show you what a girl typically working out would look like versus what you want me to look like — but it's still fucking me.
"Oh, hey."
"Don't mind me, I'm just a 12-year-old boy-man-girl lady here to ruin femininity in the Olympics for you."
"Beautiful, huh?"
What's that 12-year-old little boy doing here?
Out to win a gold medal.

Research is an essential part of education.
Students are expected to cite articles from scholarly journals when they write research papers.
You probably use journal articles in your own work.
You've probably also encountered journal articles that you wanted to read but couldn't get access to.
Why is that?
"Well, let's take a look at how scholarly journals are published today."
Professor A does some research and writes an article about it for free.
He wants to publish it so he submits it to a journal in his field.
The journal likes his article so asks Professor B and C to peer review it.
"The professors read it, evaluate it and send it back for free."
"The journal sends Professor A the changes that need to be made, if any, and Professor A sends them the final version of his article at no cost to the journal."
The publisher then puts Professor A's article with a bunch of other articles and formats them all together and charges people for access.
How much does it cost to a campus library to buy a subscription to the journal?
It depends...
"If it is a journal of Econometrics, a year subscription costs as much as two thousand one hundred and fifty-five dollars if it is the journal of Geophysical Research, it costs five thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars. if it is the journal of Brain Research, it's twenty-one thousand seven hundred forty-four dollars. not all scholarly journals cost this much but when many of the key resources for students and faculty cost an arm and a leg, not even the best funded universities and libraries can afford them all."
So librarians buy what they can afford and students and the professors just have to hope they're not missing something important.
But it doesn't have to be this way
There is an alternative to the closed subscription-based scholarly publishing model:
Open Access
"Open Access is free, unrestricted online access to scholarly works."
"Open Access journals use advertising sponsorship, author fees and other sources of revenue to support the cost of publication, keeping the access free to the user."
Authors can choose to publish their articles in one over forty-two hundred peer-reviewed Open Access Journals or they can put a copy of work published elsewhere in an online repository.
Open Access lets anyone read the latest research.
"It helps scholars stay up-to-date on each other's work... it enables computers to sift text mining and mashups, which help uncover trends that no-one would have suspected it gives authors more visibility and impact... and makes scholar work a lot easier."
Open Access brings curious minds and the world's knowledge together.
Isn't that what academia is fundamentally about?
"Free, unrestricted, online access"
Open Access
"Also, we saw the invention of computer gaming, and the computer game authors pretty quickly realized that having READ statements didn't work for most games, that you wanted a different way of organizing the program so that it could be more responsive."
"But the mainstream didn't see much of this until, say, 1984, when the Macintosh came out."
"The Macintosh was the first mainstream product that got in front of mainstream programmers with this radically new idea of how to do interactive programs, which was not based on READ but on event loops; a radically different way of writing programs."
Were the programmers happy to have this new model?
"No, they were quite unhappy."
You have to write programs inside out!
Waa.
"Nobody can do that, it's too hard."
It's just not the way God intended us to write programs.
We should go back to the command line as he intended.
"So Apple had to work really hard to try to convince programmers no, really, it's OK, you can be successful writing in this model."
"They released a program called Mac App, which was a template of a Pascal program that already came with an event loop built into it with prototypes for setting up menus and things like that, so all you had to do was hook your logic into it."
"That was just too hard, it was rejected."
"It looked like Macintosh was not going to be the big success that it turned out to be, except for one thing:"
HyperCard.
"Bill Atkinson had this little multilayer paint program with a silly little scripting language in it, and suddenly everything took off because non-programmers could be incredibly productive with HyperCard."
"They could get a stack -- that's what they called programs at that time -- and they could open it up and look at the scripts inside of it and fiddle with them, and make wonderful things happen."
"In fact, there were thousands of stacks running around the world, most of them being written by people who had no business programming, just because it was fun and easy."
"After that the professionals kind of went oh, OK, I guess it's not that hard, we could probably do that."
Then we saw an explosion of programs for Macintosh and Windows when a new generation of programmers were finally able to work with the event loop.
HyperCard worked because it was all about events.
You didn't have to build an event
"loop; it was built in, it just worked."
All you had to write were the event handlers.
"A program -- again, a stack -- was just a collection of event handlers attached to things"
like cards and buttons and fields.
And the events could bubble up — that's how it did delegation.
"It called it inheritance, but it really wasn't inheritance."
It had events
"like on mouseUp and on keyDown, on cardEnter, which would be equivalent, say, to on load today."
"And on idle, which got fired whenever the event queue was empty."
I don't think they knew what people were going to use that for.
And this machine lowers this building over the canal.
"And the water evaporates by the sun and condenses on the inside, and you get drinking water, desalinization, without expenditure of energy, using the sun."
"After we have filled this with salt water, it's for irrigation and flood control."
So all this water is directed towards water storage basins so you don't have flooding.
"Mr. Fresco sees a future where computer systems will monitor the world's environment and provide timely, accurate information on events that needs our immediate attention."
This represents the government of the future.
It would be cybernated.
"That means that computers will monitor farm production, harvest the crop, plant the seeds and maintain their packaging and everything else."
Whereas these various image screens will give you an image of any part of the Earth.
This represents a hurricane.
So you can see on these screens any area on Earth.
From 3000 miles out in space you can photograph plant diseases.
They show up as red.
"If you photograph the Amazon jungle, you will see a dark red area, which means those plants are ill or sick."
And so you can maintain with the satellite as the Earth rotates under the satellite.
You will be able to show people everything on Earth and every airplane in the air and every ship at sea.
"When you ask the computer, how many planes are there in the air at this instant?"
It will tell you exactly.
"It will tell you 10,408, 9, 10."
And you would be in touch with every area of the Earth by these screens.
There is no government in the future
The government is maintained electronically.
"But it is programmed to monitor food transportation, monitor the Earth, hurricanes, tsunamis, and tell people warning them of any problems."
So everyone will have this which gives them information about the Earth until we learn to control the tsunamis and the weather which i believe man will eventually be able to do.
"Man will eventually be able to control hurricanes, the weather and most disasters."
"Supreme Master Ching Hai has also spoken about the potential for wondrous technology to be available on our planet in the future, as in this excerpt from a July 2008 videoconference with Supreme Master Television staff in Los Angeles, California, USA."
"The technology that we are having right now is nothing, nothing compared to what we will have if all the population of the planet turn to a loving kind compassionate vegetarian diet."
"Then you will see all kind of inventions that we have never imagined before, will surface."
"And all people will live in peace and love, even if they don't pray for it."
It will come.
"Our sincere thanks Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows, for taking time to introduce The Venus Project and its underlying philosophy to us."
May a sustainable planet with everyone's needs met soon be a reality.
"And also ma, want to make sure you didn't overshoot it."
"Because if you overshot it, maybe you've got the firewall or the, I said widget."
"The firewall widget tightened down too much or, or, or something."
"You know, and there may be something you can do that would reduce that the, the, the degree by which you've overshot the, the baseline."
"Also, if the risk can't be contained within the acceptable level because you've got constraints, either in terms of budget or in terms of the attributes of the business."
"In other words, you know, we can't operate if we, if we have to put this control in place."
"Then, management may decide to accept the risk even though it's high."
"And the, those risks are also to be included in residual risk as you maintain this, these results of this risk assessment report."
"But those are the ones that probably are going to get the lion's share of your attention going forward. cuz those are the big, hairy ones for which you have not implemented any prevented, detected the work, recovery controls."
"Management is aware of them, because they've made this explicit decision to retain the."
"But you, all of you, are responsible for making sure nothing bad happens."
"I mentioned earlier I was going to give you an example of risk assessment report, and again this is a very simple one."
But it kind of puts all of the pieces together.
"The, the asset, in this case, was a customer list."
"And so, we looked at it in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability."
"And remember, I mentioned you could have this three point scale where three is high, two is medium, one is low."
"And, you know, I just threw some numbers in here so I've rated this high on confidentiality, medium on integrity, medium on availability."
"You look at the level of threats and it, again, it's a very generic term."
"But, you know, you obviously would look at specific threats but this is kind of a catch all."
"You know, I rated it two for confidentiality, two for integrity, and three for availability."
Level of vulnerabilities.
"Three for confidentiality, two for integrity, two for availability."
"And I just did a very, very simple methodology here where I just said, you know, what I'm calling the risk point is just the value of the asset times the threat times the vulnerability, A * B * C. It's just a way to rank it."
"So, three"
* two * three is eighteen.
Two * two * two is eight.
Two * three * two is twelve.
Which one are you going to focus the most attention on?
The eighteen.
"And then, you think about, well. what kind of treatment method can we apply to this? in this particular case , where you're"
"looking at confidentiality, the suggestion was that you reduce the risk by making the server password more difficult to guess."
"And by doing that, you reduce the level of threat to two and the level of vulnerability to two, so you've gone from eighteen to twelve."
This shows the long-run expansion path for a firm.
"This shows how, as it produces different amounts of goods, it will choose different units of inputs."
"So for the first level of production, it chooses five machines and 10 workers."
"Then if it wants to double production, it chooses 10 machines and 20 workers."
"So if it wants to increase production by another 50%, it chooses 15 machines and 30 workers, and so on."
This is a linear expansion path.
"This says this firm is a production function, and prices are such that basically they always want these inputs in fixed proportions."
So it would be a fixed proportional expansion path.
"No matter how much you choose to produce, you always want to use twice as much labor as capital."
"However, that doesn't have to be the case."
So this long-run expansion path is going to be what becomes our underlying cost curve.
"This is where underlying cost curves are going to come from, and hopefully where supply is going to come from, is this"
long-run expansion path.
This long-run expansion path is going to show us how much more we have to spend to produce different amounts of quantity.
"Now in this case, what you see here is that you have these fixed proportions."
"That as you increase quantity, that the input portion stays the same, but that doesn't have to be."
"For instance, figure 9b, you can imagine a world where, as you produce more units, capital becomes less productive."
"So you want more and more labor, but not that much more capital."
So this might be the example of like McDonald's.
"If McDonald's wants to produce more burgers, ultimately there's only so many fryolators it can use."
"Ultimately, it needs more people to package up the burgers and sell them."
So you might think that capital becomes less and less productive.
"And as a given McDonald's franchise expands its sales, it might want to increase the ratio of labor to capital."
So this is a case where capital's becoming less productive.
"And as you see, as you expand production you're going to more labor and less capital."
"In other words, the marginal product of labor is still steep, and the marginal product of capital is flattening."
"So you want more and more labor, and not as much capital."
That's one kind of expansion path.
Figure 9c shows a different kind of expansion path.
Here's one where labor becomes less productive.
"So this might be, for example, something which is a mass production process, like producing automobiles."
"Where basically as you produce more and more automobiles, you need more and more machines to produce them."
"They run the first 10 minutes of the film, and then they stop it dead... and then they run commercials on the screen, and they have a break... where they walk up and down selling ice cream sandwiches and pop corn... completely interrupting the movie."
"And I remember the first time I witnessed that, I turned to someone in the audience and asked..."
"""How many pauses are we going to have to sit through?"""
"And they said, ""just one."" But it's a real interruption."
"So this is a practice that's been going on for a long time in Europe, and now it's come to America."
Why?
Because theater chains are in trouble.
Theater chains just aren't making as much money as they should on their films...
"And also you have to realize that studios have what's called a ""90/10 split"" on the first week."
Most of money goes to the studio.
Only 10% goes to the theater.
"And since most movies these days are what's called ""front loading""..."
They make all of their money in the first couple of weeks...
"Even though the split increases for the theater as it goes out into the second and third and fourth week... or ""frame,"" as they call it in the business... it's just not that much money."
"So commercials, unfortunately I'm afraid, are here to stay."
"When a movie says it's going to start at 1:30, I usually show up a 1:45, and miss all of the commercials... and that's pretty much what I recommend that you do."
"Commercials are, unfortunately, part of the contemporary movie scene, and will stay that way..."
But it's necessary to maintain the theatrical experience... and that's what we really need to do to keep films in theaters.
"I'm Wheeler Winston Dixon, and this is Frame By Frame."
"If you look at the history of the world, a huge fraction of the improvements in the standard of living have come because private businesses have created new products, have given people jobs, have generated profits that raise people out of poverty and allow them to live fruitful and productive lives with reasonable standards of living."
"We can have much more of that, and it will have beneficial effects around the world, if we step back from the excessive regulation and have a much more capitalistic system."
"My name is Jeff Miron, and I'm Director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University."
I want to talk about three myths about capitalism.
The first is that being pro-capitalism is the same as being pro-business.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
"The point of capitalism is to make sure that businesses have to compete vigorously against each other, and that benefits consumers."
It's not good for the businesses per se because they have to work really hard.
"So many businesses understand this, and they hate capitalism."
"They're constantly trying to get government to erect various rules, restrictions, regulations that help them, but they're not in the interest of the consumers."
So pro-capitalism is good for consumers.
That's who we're ultimately trying to help.
A second myth is that capitalism generates an unfair distribution of income.
"Self efficacy, caught in the motivation, and tolerance or ambiguity."
"By self efficacy, what we mean is that this is your belief that you can do something and something specific."
"So it's not self confidence, which is a bit more of a broader perception."
But it's efficacy in that you believe for a given scenario and a given situation that you can have success with that.
That you will be effective in that situation for that particular task or activity.
And that's a key predictor of individual performance.
The second element that we'll look at is the cognitive motivation.
"And again, that's that element of thinking."
Do you like to research?
"Do you like to understand? do you like to get a good clean sense of what's involved and what's at stake, and what you can do in that scenario?"
"And we see that if you do not have that high level of cognitive motivation, you tend to perhaps over rely on assumptions or experience."
And we see that successful entrepreneurs often have a higher need for cognitive motivation and that they're willing to do the research and they're willing to try and understand why things happen or may happen as they will.
And the third element is the tolerance re-ambiguity.
And that fundamentally is just being comfortable with change.
It's recognizing that you can't predict everything that things are going to happen that are unexpected.
And that you're comfortable within that.
And you believe that you can be successful within that changing environment.
"There are three cognitive biases to think about and to be aware of, and some of these are positives, and some of these can be negatives."
And the first if over confidence.
We certainly want to be confident.
We certainly want to believe in our venture.
But it's perhaps too much of a good thing if you are over confident.
"So, in that way, we want to be careful not to be overly ambitious."
And we've talked before about throwing good money after that.
It is okay to close a venture.
"It is okay to start something and stop it. and in that way again, there's something to be learned from that."
"But, you certainly want to be sure you know, that you balance your ideas."
That your thoughts are supported by research and that your assumptions are validated.
Representatives.
What we mean here is that you want to be sure that you are not basing your decisions on too small of a sample set.
"That you don't ask someone if they like your idea, they say yes, and you start your venture."
Ask many people.
We hope for better biomarkers.
"Again, heterozygote advantage does not seem to exist for Alzheimer's so we'll leave that go until we get to depression and let's look now at therapeutic approaches."
"Suppose a person is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's, what can be done?"
"Well the molecules that are in the clinic now, and that are the molecules of choice, are the"
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors because neurons that make acetylcholine.
Are among the first to die in Alzheimer's disease.
They're in the basal forebrain.
"And therefore, if one can prolong the life of acetylcholine by inhibiting its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase."
One has more acetylcholine.
"And the lack, relative lack of cholinergic neurons does not matter much. the three that are on the market are."
Somewhat effective.
"Interestingly enough, galantamine, may also be, a positive, allosteric modulator, of alpha four beta two receptors, so that, it could be acting, both, by preventing the breakdown, of acetylcholine, and by enhancing its action."
"Also on the market is one NMDA inhibitor, called Memantine, and the thinking here is that."
Excessive activity at NMDA receptors may be excitotoxic.
"And so, it may be possible to slow down the time course of Alzheimer's using Mementine."
"For both of these types of medications, the slowing down is statistically significant. but."
We need very much better drugs.
"So, because we've talked about that the various Secretase sites in beta APP, you can appreciate that."
Beta-secretase inhibitors would also be useful if one could develop them with no side effects and specific action.
There have been other drugs with unknown mechanisms that failed for Alzheimer's trials.
Gamma secretase inhibitors might also be useful.
The one that got the furthest along in clinical trials also failed.
One could think about targeting the protease complex with notch-sparing gamma secretase inhibitors.
Remember the.
"Probable natural function of gamma secretase is to, protealize Notch."
So you'd need to develop a gamma secretase inhibitor which allows Notch proteolysis to go ahead.
But blocks cleavage of the APP.
"And, other gamma secretase drugs."
"Modulators that shift the proportion of a beta peptides, in favor of shorter, less harmful, peptides. have been conceived, but not brought to the clinic."
"And then there's the topic of antibodies against a, beta APP, or, A-Beta."
And the three that had been tried so far in clinical trials are listed here.
The have been largely unsuccessful.
Norms are defined as rules or standards that effect what's appropriate or inappropriate behavior in a group.
"Now, if any of you are teachers or have been teachers, you know, that you have to have order in your classroom and rules for students - what's appropriate and what's inappropriate."
"And even a parent does this in the family, which is actually a type of group."
It's more of a social group.
Kids have to know what is expected of them and when they're behaving appropriately and inappropriately.
"Well, norms keep things orderly."
They maintain respect.
"They make sure everybody has a chance to talk, makes sure that we don't take short cuts or discriminate against some one in some way or put somebody down."
"So, let's talk about norms."
"We're going to talk about two types of norms that are important, like the rules of the game or the ideal team."
"And now, these two types of norms, and this is actually something I am going to do is create my own categories for you just to make norms a little more analytic or make it a little more common sense."
I'm going to talk about process norms and relationship norms.
"First, let's talk about process norms."
"Now, process norms are rules about who can talk and what can they say when they're talking."
It's like turn-taking.
"Like what order are we going to take, and how are we going to make sure everybody gets to have some input?"
And let's not interrupt each other.
"Let's give everybody enough time, and let's listen and make sure that everybody gets a chance to say what should be said, and what shouldn't we say."
What's off limits?
What crosses the line into being something that's outside what this group really needs to be doing?
"Maybe it's confidential information, or maybe it's information about the past that's not relevant to what we're doing right now, staying on task for example."
That this is not on task.
This is a new issue; let's wait until later on that.
"It's a process norm, right there."
Now let's look at relationship norms.
"Now, relationship norms are about people."
Rules about treating each other in ways that are appropriate in a group.
It's about mostly respect.
"Listening and respecting each other and making sure we don't insult each other or condescend, even feel inferior in a group just to be on a mutual respect level that everybody is equally apart of the group and no one's better than anyone else."
Everybody is entitled to their opinions and no one's opinion is superior.
"That's one of the norms is a relational norm, and there are also norms about power."
What's appropriate use of power?
"I'm just continuing this ultra, five star problem just so you make sure you can understand everything that's going on, especially with tension and pulleys and all the rest."
So here we were.
We figured out the net forces acting on this block.
And we said it was the tension of the rope minus the force of friction.
And we figured out the force of friction in the traditional way.
And that equals the mass of the block times the acceleration of the block.
"And actually, it would have been a good idea here to solve for tension."
So what is the tension pulling on this block?
The tension is equal to 10 times the acceleration of the block plus 39.2 newtons.
"And actually, this is probably the one that I should have squared because this is even more useful than what I wrote before."
So we figured out the tension of the rope here in terms of the acceleration of the block.
And then we moved on to the pulley.
"And we said, OK, well what are the net forces acting on here?"
"We have 150 newtons to the right, and we have twice the tension pulling back right?"
Cause we have the tension here pulling back and the tension there.
That's kind of what pulleys do.
And we knew that because the tension in the rope is constant.
"And if you were to do it here, not that it matters, the tension of the rope here is T and then the wall is pulling back on the rope with the force T."
And that's why this point is constant.
"But we don't worry about that, so back to the problem."
"So we said the net forces on the pulley, which is 150 minus 2 times the tension, is equal to the mass of the pulley, 5 kilograms, times the acceleration-- and this is the p here-- times the acceleration of the pulley."
"And at the very beginning of the problem I had said, well the acceleration of the pulley is half the acceleration of the block."
And I went off about all the reasons.
"And I'll say it one more time, because if this pulley moves an inch to the right, not only will the pulley move an inch to the right, this length of wire will get an inch longer, right, cause this is stationary here."
"So this length of wire, since the wire is a constant length, will get an inch shorter."
"So this is getting an inch shorter and the pulley is moving an inch to the right, so this block will move 2 inches to the right."
"So that's how we came to the conclusion that whatever the velocity to the right of this pulley is, the velocity of this block will be twice that."
"Or whatever the acceleration of this pulley is to the right, the acceleration of this block will be twice that."
And that's what we wrote here.
The acceleration of the pulley or the acceleration of the block is twice the acceleration of the pulley.
Or the acceleration of the pulley is 1/2 the acceleration of the block.
"So with that said, we took this equation and we substituted the acceleration of the pulley."
"And soon enough, they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction."
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
"Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism."
"And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me."
"Imagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face."
"You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?"
You would recoil.
You would call the police.
(Laughter)
"You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction."
"We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly."
This is our body wisdom; it's not something mediated by our language.
Our body just knows that.
And we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
"It happens to some of our phyletic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long."
"So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without which they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, socially."
"Now, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you."
"Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;amp;M."
"So I could not attract her attention, but something -- a thing -- did."
"Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people."
"Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like."
"Now, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences."
"What she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging, moment by moment, as she is isolating herself further and further."
"So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we're going to be."
"But, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind, and this is what's happening with her brain."
"Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders."
And it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all; there are those individuals who talk too much.
"Given 12, we would have to resort to trial-and-error to find matching exponents."
How hard is this?
"Well, with small numbers, it's easy; but if we used a prime modulus which is hundreds of digits long, it becomes impractical to solve."
"Even if you had access to all computational power on Earth, it could take thousands of years to run through all possibilities."
So the strength of a one-way function is based on the time needed to reverse it.
"Now, this is our solution:"
"First, Alice and Bob agreed publicly on a prime modulus and a generator, in this case 17 and 3."
"Then, Alice selects a private random number, say 15, and calculates 3 to the power 15 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Bob."
"Then, Bob selects his private random number, say 13, and calculates 3 to the power 13 mod 17, and sends this result publicly to Alice."
"And now the heart of the trick,"
"Alice takes Bob's public result and raises it to the power of her private number to obtain the shared secret, which in this case is 10."
"Bob takes Alice's public result and raises it to the power of his private number, resulting in the same shared secret."
"Notice they did the same calculation, though it may not look like it at first."
"Consider Alice, the 12 she received from Bob was calculated as 3 to the power 13 mod 17, so her calculation was the same as 3 to the power 13 to the power 15 mod 17."
"Now consider Bob, the 6 he received from Alice was calculated as 3 to the power 15 mod 17, so his calculation was the same as 3 to the power 15 to the power 13."
Notice they did the same calculation with the exponents in the different order.
"When you flipped the exponent, the result doesn't change."
"So they both calculated 3 raised to the power of their private numbers, without one of these private numbers, 15 or 13."
Eve will not be able to find the solution.
And this is how it's done.
"While Eve is stuck grinding away at the discrete logarithm problem and with large enough numbers, we can say it's practically impossible for her to break the encryption in a reasonable amount of time."
This solves the key exchange problem.
It can be used in conjunction with a pseudorandom generator to encrypt messages between people who've never met.
"What we're going to do right now is a recurrence relation, which is a kind of recursive mathematical function, which is a good match for this recursive algorithmic expression for Rec_Russian--"
Rec_Russian recurrence relation.
"Looking at the structure of Rec_Russian, if a is 0, then it's going to execute 1 statement-- basically the test to see whether it's 0 and returns."
"Otherwise, if a is bigger than 0 and even, let's take a look at what Rec_Russian does in that case."
"We come in here with a number that is even and greater than 0 is going to execute the condition of this if statement, which fails so there's 1 of that."
Then 1 more to do this plus it's going to recursively workout the value of this quantity.
Then one more operation to multiply that by 2.
I call a total of 3 plus however long it takes to multiply a over 2 times b.
We don't know what that is.
"If you look at the figures, they're all coming down."
So I don't know where the hell they got that from.
"I was going to go into the Media Freedom Committee's campaign to open the Family Courts, which ended up being absolutely useless, because they can get into the Family Court..."
"You can get into the Family Court as a journalist now, but you can't report any names or any identifying factors, so nobody goes, and the only coverage you get is the documentary, or in-depth, sort of coverage."
"So if they got a little bit more out of the courts,"
"I'm just not sure that it's going to make much difference; however, I don't know, that's just a speculation."
"Okay, I'm running out of time."
"I'm going to put this up on my blog, so if you want to read it all, that's fine, and I'll skip over..."
"The final point, I think, is the way that the media approaches ethical issues generally."
"It tends to be utilitarian, the greatest happiness to the greatest number."
They tend to forget the rider to that is you shouldn't be doing any harm to people.
And I was reminded of how all this works when I went back into the Sunday Star Times newsroom for six months a couple of years ago.
I hadn't written in anger for about 20 years;
I thought it was time to go back.
"And I just realised, after 20 years of teaching ethics in the classroom, how easy it is to resolve ethical issues in the classroom compared to a stress situation, such as the one that Jonathan works in, where you've got one of the most highly competitive markets, as the Sunday's, and all of my high moral ground occupation disappeared almost instantly, and I was urging people to do things that were possibly questionable."
I have seen what happens when you do...
You can get a strange situation with some stories.
"We had a case, when I was in Taranaki, of a very prominent family."
Their son committed suicide in Sydney.
He was a prominent rugby player.
"And because it happened in Australia, of course, they weren't covered by the same rules."
"The NZ Herald got into this in an incredibly insensitive and speculative way, and the family felt very battered and resentful."
"The local newspaper treated it with real sensitivity, didn't back off the story, it was on the front page, reported that death was self-inflicted, and the family was very grateful."
And I used that case when I was in Taranaki.
"We brought in that reporter and the uncle, the spokesman for the family, to talk to us, so our students could see what the impacts of that were."
"So I have to speculate, if we liberalise the regime, as the media want, it's a safe bet that someone is going to push the rules to the limit, in the name of media freedom and utilitarianism, and it'll just be bad luck for any individuals caught up in the gears."
Thank you.
[applause]
SARAH LEE:
"Thank you, Jim."
"I've been looking forward with somewhat anticipation wondering what Jim was going to talk about today, but it's been fantastic."
I've taken a few points from that myself.
"Farewell, Egypt"
"So, after you've done all these things with respect to assessment and treatment, there's going to be some residual risk."
"You can't treat risk out of the, out of the system completely."
"So then, you have to make some decisions with respect to which ones you're going to accept and which ones you're going to try to, to transfer. the, the decision is driven by a number of different things."
"The first is the, the three realities that make risk acceptance, the risk acceptance decision a foregone conclusion."
Every organization has to make it.
"Which are, you're not going to be able to deal with all the risks in the organization."
Second one is no system can be made absolutely secure.
"And third is that, you've got a limited pool of resources for addressing these exposures."
"So, given those three things, those three realities, there's going to have to be a decision at some point about which risks you're willing to accept."
"And the way that you do that is the organization, the organization being the organization's management. needs to decide, needs to decide what its tolerance level is."
How much risk it's willing to accept.
"And then, if the risk that's been identified through the risk assessment process is beyond that level, then you look at maybe implementing some supplemental controls."
"And, if it's been the level, then you accept it. continue to monitor it, make sure it doesn't get out of out of tolerance. but that's basically the approach."
"Now, and I, I, I know I say this a lot, but I'm going to say it one more time."
"When you think about how management defines it's, it's acceptable"
"level of risk, it's not just direct dollar cost."
"It's, you know, how sensitive are they to bad publicity?"
How sensitive are they to being embarrassed?
"I would argue that most senior executives would rather have bad news come out about the company that doesn't directly affect them than they would be to have information comes out that makes them look stupid, makes them embarrassed."
"So, that embarrassment factor is going to, and should come into play ."
"Because you don't want to run into a situation where, you know, management says, okay."
"We, we're willing to assume an aggregate exposure of twenty million dollars a year."
And we don't want anything about us no negative publicity on the front page of the local newspaper.
"And you say, okay, chief, you got it."
"And then, something happens."
"And it's, you know, section two of the paper, page three."
"But it's, you know, the CFO, you know, left his laptop in his car."
"It was stolen, and it had the company's financial records on it."
It was within the tolerance.
"But he's, he's embarrassed."
"And I guarantee you that if you go back to him, and say, well, you know, it was within the tolerance that you specified."
"Both of those are fighting against that continuous thing, the copying and the shuffling, and the inserting is there something about that flexibility of the rewiring that can kind of get us out of this some operations having to be slow because other operations are fast."
Question.
[Inaudible].
Yeah.
Why is space used for stacks when those are half?
Yeah.
"So in this case, right, depending on how you're modeling your stack, if it is with vectors, right, then you're likely to have the before and the after stack, both have capacity for everything, even when they're not used, right."
And so it's very
"likely that either right give 100 characters they're either on one stack or the other, but the other one might be kind of harboring the 100 spots for them when they come back."
"Or it could just be that you have the link list, which are allocating and de allocating but has the overhead of that."
"So it's likely that no matter which implementation the stack you have, you probably have about twice the storage that you need because of the two sides and the overhead that's kind of coming and going there."
So we will see the link list and we'll talk that guy through on
Friday.
I'll see you then.
"People are very, very aware of social feedback - like we're really tuned to this."
"And so things that can potentially harm your social standing can potentially impede your relationships with other people, these are things that we take very seriously."
"When we're sitting there in the context of that situation, we don't always respond like we should."
Now
I will put ECG sensors on you.
"We wanted to look at just how do people respond to social stress and we wanted to know how they respond physiologically to it, how they responded cognitively and how they respond subjectively."
"At the outset of the experiment, the first thing that people are doing is that we want to collect these baseline recordings of physiology."
To do that we need to affix these physiological sensors that monitor activity.
And so here is the ECG signal coming in.
What we're doing is looking at changes from their normal state.
"This is the skin temperature, and you see right here it's at 93.42 degrees."
So they were told to think about stress as a coping tool.
"Like, stress isn't bad, that these responses have evolved to help our ancestors survive, that if we didn't have these things we'd be doing worse."
So after this we tell them they're going to give a speech about their strengths and weaknesses.
"Ok, we are ready to begin."
Please tell us about your strengths and weaknesses as a person.
We will be evaluating your performance throughout the speech.
This is a very self-relevant speech.
In search of pastures and water sources they frequently cross the border with their cattle and goats.
"Cholima Logid, a father of nine used to cross the border to trade livestock. but he was confronted with different challenges."
Diseases cross the border with ease.
Pastoraslists can only rely on services offered at endpoints in either Uganda or Kenya.
Like here in Moroto Uganda where local organizations maintain routine checkups.
But there are differences in the quality and the prices of the veterinary services offered on both sides of the border.
And the lack of coordination makes it difficult to control disease outbreaks.
"With support from the European Union and ECHO this situation prompted IGAD, FAO and other organizations to initiate programs harmonized animal health care on both sides of the border."
April 2013 a Memorandum of Understanding between the government of Uganda and Kenya is signed.
The agreement commits both governments to develop programs for animal health care in the border regions.
The local NGO ACTED initiated the process.
ACTED's role began in August 2011. when we initiated a cross-border meeting ona very local level just among the district veterinary officers.
At that time it was to address and outbreak of Brucellosis.
We learned at that time that the dvos didn't have the freedom to work together without blessings from their ministries. and as a result we needed to move to ministry level.
Under the RlSPA initiative
"FAO liaised with the governments of Uganda and Kenya and animal health coordination was moved up the political agenda, resulting in the"
Memorandum of Understanding.
The next step is now to implement.
And the implementation entails development of a program program that is going to look up specifics on how to coordinate and share information.
Number two on how to have common activities.
For example in animal health.
How will they synchronize the vaccinations and treatment information.
The sharing and surveillance.
So that's a critical part of memorandum.
After the devastating drought that hit the Horn of African in 2011 governments in Eastern Africa spearheaded initiatives to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities
This new partnership is an important step.
One of the first issues to tackle is a frequenty reported lack of drugs to treat sick livestock.
Here Timothy Kelae is spraying a goat against tick.
But getting the spray and other treatments and medicines is a major issue.
The MoU will not necessarily provide the drugs  but the key thing is the implemenation of it which is going to be through the program.
The program now will go specifically to where the need is.
If there is a need of drugs
"There, was another point that I wanted to make that now, Nih has a policy that if your paper is supported by them as part of a grant or contract The finished man even if the journal wants to charge money for downloading the paper, wha."
"After a year, NlH will put it on PubMed as a finished manuscript which may not have had the kind of copy editing that will finally."
Hm.
Appear in the journal.
But it'll at least be your final version of the manuscript.
"And so you'll be able to, to read papers that have been out for a year, even if, for no cost, even if the journal is the kind that wants to charge money for it."
"That is great, yeah."
"And if you could change one thing about the publication process, what would you change?"
"Well I had, when you asked me that question before, I got two things."
"First of all, I think there should be greater evaluation of negative findings, by both researchers and by The journals."
"You know a, you're gonn, when you do studies, you're gonna have this great idea that you think something is a cause or prevention of, of some disease."
And you're gonna do a study and it's not gonna pan out.
"That is the, that is the most common experience that we epidemiologists have."
"In fact and a graduate student here, who is doing a study of Metformin and in relation to risk of breast cancer because."
"It was some thought that this might be preventive, Agent for, you know for reducing the risk of certain kinds of breast cancer."
"And This is being done at, at Kaiser Permanete in our division of research."
"But It's looking like, and, and this is not final result."
But it's looking like that's probably not gonna turn up.
"What was hoped for or what was expected and naturally, the researcher is very disappointed in that, but you know, I say, you know, this is important to know too, that there's a negative finding."
So don't be Discouraged if you have a negative finding.
"It's important that, that get published and it's imp-, and, I wish journals would be more interested in, in publishing these, and, sometimes it, it, you know, a negative finding, if you want to get it out there, could be written in the form of a brief report which will take less journal space, it'll get higher priority so, I think that's, that is my main..."
Answer to your question.
"I, I also wish that there was greater ease in getting peer reviewers to review a paper."
Sometimes we have a list at the American Journal of Epidemiology and I sent a particular paper out to people who said this was their specialty or special interest and out of ten people who we sent it to only one agreed to review.
Oh wow.
"And we tried to get two and I was asked, you know, can you make a decision on just the one review because we can't just keep."
"Trying to get, with your."
"So, as, as a scientist and an author."
"Please accept the responsibility of being a reviewer, as well as a As an author, we've had some cases where."
"You know we've published papers by a certain author, and this author consistently refused to review papers."
And naturally they're not well regarded by the.
Mm.
"People get off of gluten and they say, you know, remarkably, I feel better."
There's nothing wrong with following a gluten-free diet if you don't have Celiac disease.
"If you suspect you have Celiac disease, it's a good idea to get tested and have a confirmation of your diagnosis."
Many people find that they lose weight when they go on a gluten-free diet.
"If you've been consuming hundreds of extra calories from breads and pastas and rices, it makes sense that when you cut those foods out of your diet, you're going to"
lose weight.
"If you're interested in learning more about Celiac disease, I recommend you check out some of these resources."
"The Gluten-fFree Diet book, by Shelley Case, is a great resource."
"Shelley is a Canadian dietitian, who, herself, has Celiac disease."
"A number of the different foundations, like the Celiac Sprue Association, and the"
"Celiac Disease Foundation, can also provide you with valuable information. ."

"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On August 1, 2007, the eye 35 bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 45."
Newspaper articles followed asking questions why did the bridge collapse.
And the experts pointed to structural deficiencies such as corroded bearings or faulty-- fatigue cracks in the steel around the bridges joints.
"But for the victims and their families, the important question was not why did the bridge collapse, but why did the bridge collapsed at the exact moment when I was on it."
"Ann was on the bridge because she was on a cell phone with her friend, so she missed her exit."
Otherwise she wouldn't have been on the bridge when it collapsed.
"On the other hand, Jim was not on the bridge because he happened to meet a friend and stopped to chat, or he would have been on the bridge."
The questions the bridge victims asked are just like the questions of the Zande in the Central African Republic.
"Just the same questions when misfortune strikes them, they're not interested in why did the bridge collapse, but rather why did the bridge collapsed at the precise moment when I was on it."
But the Zande have a different kind of answer.
"It's not God, it's not karma, not coincidence, not God's will, but witchcraft."
The main point I was making today is that witchcraft gets a bad rap.
"It's seen as backwards, superstitious, barbaric, and pictures like this one, of a Zande witchcraft-- witch doctor, which I took, don't help."
But witchcraft among the Zande is not an irrational belief system from the heart of darkness.
"It does nothing more or nothing less than other belief systems do, including world religions."
"They all explain why things happen, especially bad things."
"They do so in a way that allows intervention, especially medical intervention, and it allows to blame someone else or something else for our misfortune."
I'll be making a plea today for cultural relativism.
"Deep down, one person's witchcraft is another person's Christianity."
"The Zande live where the three countries of South Sudan, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet."
"So, another use of single assignment form is that if we see the assignment w equals x in a block."
"So here, the register w is being just copied from the register x."
Then all subsequent uses of w can be replaced by uses of x.
"So, for example, Here we have an assignment to b And then we have a copy, a, is=to b."
"And then, down here, w e have a use of a in the last instruction."
"Well, that use of a in the last instruction can be replaced by a use of B. And this is called copy propagation, okay?"
Propagating copies through the code
"And by itself, notice, that this makes absolute no improvement in the code it's only useful in conjunction with some of the other optimizations."
"So, for example, in this case after we do the copy propagation, it might be the case that this instruction can be deleted."
"If A is not used any place else in the code, then this instruction can be removed."
Now let's do a little more complex example and use some of the optimizations that we've discussed so far On a slightly bigger piece of code.
So we are starting with this piece of code here on the left and we are going to wind up with this piece of code here on the right.
And how does that work?
"Well, first we have a copy propagation, so we have A is assigned the value five."
"And, so we can propagate that value forward."
And replace the use of a
"later on by five, and I should say."
"That when the value is propagated is a constant rather than a registered name is called Constant propagation instead of Copy propagation, but it's exactly the same thing."
"We, we, we have a single value assigned on the right hand side, either a register name or constant and we are replacing uses of that in later instructions by that register name or constant."
Okay?
"So once we have replaced a here by five now we can do constant folding, and now we have two constant arguments for this instruction."
So this two times five can be replaced by the constant ten.
Now notice we have another assignment of a constant to a register and so we can propagate that constant forward.
We can replace the subsequent uses of X by the number ten.
And now we have more opportunities for constant folding ten plus six can be replaced by the value sixteen.
"Alright now we have another, another value here which is a, a constant assignment so another instruction here which is just an assignment of a constant to a register so we can p ropagate that constant forward."
Alright then we wind up down here with ten times sixteen And I see over here in my final example here I didn't bother to propagate the ten to x.
"But we can do that, and this So we can either do this optimization."
"So x times sixteen if we didn't do the propagation, would be equivalent to x left shift four."
Or we can just replace this by ten times sixteen.
That'd be even better.
We wind up achieving the value 160.
"Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener."
Which he did -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
"There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,"
Leicestershire and Somerset.
"And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan."
"And the head of the council said,"
"""If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."""
"As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging."
"In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this."
And we see it all over the place as well now.
"But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions."
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
Because I think stories are vital here.
"And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here."
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
"Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company."
"And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden."
"Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States."
"So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?"
"Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil."
"I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky."
"But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point."
"Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable."
"And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Good afternoon.
"First of all, I'm not that great."
I'm just a chemist.
"I'm the person who knows about materials, but I don't know so much."
And I am pretty mediocre.
"For example, I don't do any sports, or I cannot dance,"
We need to make sure that we do not harden our hearts to God's work.
"We need to make sure that we allow Him to work through us, work in us, and ultimately shape us and change us to be able to use the various gifts and talents that He's given us for His glory."
I hope you were blessed by this.
Have a great day!
Projectile Motion
In this AP maths interactive model we are going to take a look at the independence of the horizontal and vertical components of velocity.
And this will help us understand projectile motion.
"So I have a red ball and a blue ball, equal mass, and we are just going to let them drop under free fall."
So you can see that their motion is identical.
I will just go through that in slow motion.
At each frame the vertical motion there is identical.
I'm going to project the red ball horizontally at five meters per second.
Now vertically I haven't changed anything.
We will pressure up.
When I move through these frames in slow motion the vertical motion remains identical.
Take this point here.
"Even though the red ball's horizontal components of velocity is five meters per second and it's being projected towards the right, vertically nothing has changed."
Both balls still vertical components of velocity equal to minus six point four meters per second and they are both the same height.
I will reset again and this time I will change the horizontal velocity to eight meters per second.
"Once again, if I go through this frame by frame we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical."
The only difference is the red ball has a horizontal component of velocity and it is being projected horizontally.
"What I will do this time, I will also give the balls an initial vertical velocity."
Both balls are going to be projected upwards at four meters per second.
Let's see that again in slow motion.
Frame by frame again we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical.
The only difference is the horizontal component of the red ball's velocity.
And this is very important when we are trying to model projectile motion.
The horizontal and vertical components of velocity are independent and we can model them separately.
Narrator:
"Refrigerant leaks are the most common problem in an air conditioning system, and are usually the result of faulty hoses or rubber"
O-rings.
Large leaks are rare and require the system to be opened up for repair.
"Hence, these animals were in Central Italy before Roman times."
"However, agriculture also arrived to Italy way before Romans."
"In fact, the Neolithization of Italy occurred about 6000 years BC."
How to narrow down the arrival period of these cattle?
"Mitochondrial DNA, our time machine, helps also in this case."
"By reconstructing genealogies and knowing DNA mutation rate, it became possible to date the ancestors shared by modern Central Italian and South West Asian cattle."
These ancestors lived in South West Asia and a branch of their progeny moved to Tuscany.
"The molecular clock dated their arrival around 2,000 BC."
"So we have some evidence on a possible relationship with the Etruscans: geography, date, the sea route..."
"They arose in Central Italy in the first millennium BC, exactly in that area."
"Look, we found a real proof of this..."
"I'm kidding, no scientific journal would take it as an evidence, however we found an Etruscan fibula representing a Maremmana-like bull, a male one."
"You see female horns are lyre-shaped, while male ones are crescent-shaped."
The origin of Etruscan civilization is still debated.
"The Italian school supports the local origin of Etruscans even if a clear influence from Eastern culture is acknowledged, so that their period of highest development is referred to as the Oriental Period- but they think they're local."
European Experts are divided between local origin with Eastern influence and purely Eastern origin.
"Archaeologists have different opinions, as linguists do."
"We only understand a few words of their language, and we know the Etruscan alphabet."
"But no analogous to the Rosetta Stone, that could allow us to understand Egyptian hieroglyphic, was ever found."
"Interestingly, some Etruscan words seem to have more sense when interpreted according to the Semitic rather than Indo-European languages."
"Herodotus, in his ""Stories"" reports that Etruscans were Lydians, once settled on the coast of modern Turkey, that sailed to Tuscany and funded the Etruscan civilization."
Human genetics for a long time have produced inconclusive results.
Etruscan bones have been analysed.
The results indicate modern Tuscans as the closest population to Etruscans and Anatolians just a little further.
"Since Etruscans were critical in interpreting our results, we seek advice from re-known human geneticists."
And since we were no longer talking about
"Etruscan cattle, but people, we went to Cavalli Sforza and his colleagues."
Antonio Torroni at that time was working on human DNA from people
living in small villages of Etruscan heritage.
This because people in large cities are probably mixed and have excessively diluted
DNA signatures of ancient origin.
The end of the story is that we joined bovine and human evidence.
- so accepting.
And that builds up.
"The most powerful emotion which I know, the inspiration of peace in deep meditation, and that has moved me to tears."
I've cried many times as a monk.
"But not out of grief, or out of anger, or out of frustration."
"Just cried out of pure inspiration, beauty, joy, delight, either in seeing amazing inspiring feats of others or just seeing the beauty and peace in your own heart."
This is actually what happens and why I've often said that it's the females in general do better in deep meditation.
"Simply because they have more familiarity, in general I'm saying, because there are many exceptions"
- and you're probably one of them [laughter].
"But I've noticed that because you do need that emotional sensitivity to be able to allow these positive emotions to grow, to be able to develop them in the first place."
Deep meditation is a powerful emotional state.
It's not a blanking out.
It's not an intellectual state.
It's what you feel - deeply.
"The whole point of mindfulness is being deeper where you already are - feeling it, being it."
"Not with thought, with this mindfulness which can accept the power of a still mind."
Those forces get very very strong.
I'd say the highest emotion I've ever felt are the emotions in deep meditation.
So still but incredibly powerful.
"They move you to become monk, they move you to stay as a monk, they move you to teach, they empower you."
So these are the very highest emotions.
"So in Buddhism we're not saying you should be this emotionless zombie, like a robot, because that's what sometimes people think."
"They think when you meditate you can't get any rise out of you, you're not supposed to tell jokes, or laugh at jokes, you're supposed to be like this automaton who doesn't feel because you're supposed to have no craving, no emotions, no attachment, you're never unhappy, you're never happy, you're sometimes in this middle just like.."
If that was the case I would never be a monk.
"We start the path with the corners of our mouth turned downwards, in the middle part of the path the corners of our mouth are horizontal, as the path develops those corners go higher and higher and higher [laughs]."
It's great seeing these enlightened masters in places like Thailand - and they're the happiest people who would really laugh.
"That told me something, that the goal of this is not being emotionally dead."
The goal of this path is having those negative emotions transcended and replaced by this beautiful inspiring peaceful kind compassionate empathetic emotions.
Caused by letting go of control.
Caused by kindness.
Caused by the great gentleness of respect to every moment.
"That way whatever's happening to you in your life, the negative emotions, make peace with them, they're going to pass, they're part of things."
"So, not really legally trademark violation cos it's distinct enough but certainly perceived as unfriendly, awkward and difficult."
"That went on for a while, and Brendan and the rest of us posted something that said"
"""OK, you're right, we're gonna change the name we'll change it before we ship our next version."""
"That was a problem, because it meant that the version was ready to ship before we had a name for it."
"Shipping it with no name seemed like a loss of momentum,"
Brendan had made a commitment and we had a really intense emotional survival fight
"like a couple of weeks, I think it was a couple of weeks, to try to figure out what we were gonna call this thing."
"The developer, Ben,"
liked the idea of doing something with fire in the name.
So we went through a dictionary or a book
looking for all the words that started with fire that might make sense.
So we started going through them.
"On the side, we were doing a very professional process of thinking about ""oh, what does the browser mean?"
How do you develop a brand?

Is it trust or is it fun?
And there was this very professional process on the side.
"But the reality was the name was chosen when Ben had a list of words that started with fire, we started looking at the ones we liked, and then taking the ones we liked and looking to see which of them didn't have trademark problems."
And Firefox was the one.
It turned out it had a slight trademark issue but we were able to resolve that one.
"We also knew that it had a mascot, we could have an image that would be good and I think it might have been Asa who first found the Chinese red panda, that there really truly is an animal called the Firefox and it's adorable or whatever."
So there we were.
We picked the name and then were able to ship Firefox 0.8.
Seven!
Seven?
"Ok, seven."
So this would be in 2004.
"This is in the spring of 2004, we had the foundation for seven or eight months, we're burning through our money, we're trying to figure out how we're gonna support ourselves, we have a good size community, we have an office, a very funky sublet from some friends of the Mozilla project, who when the giant .com boom had gotten a lot more office space than they needed and so they'd given us this little funky sublet, there is one picture of it floating around if you've seen that picture of 10 or 12 of us at a table with the cables hanging down in the middle of it, it had no running water, you had to go back into the janitor's closet in the back of the building to get running water or to wash any dishes, we bought a portable dishwasher and we rolled it down to the janitor's closet to wash our margarine glasses, mostly."
"So we were finally able, in the midst of all of that, we have a name, we can ship our product."
"So, let me encode an ordering by a labeling of the vertices with the numbers one through N."
This is just to encode the position of each vertex in this ordering.
So formally there's gonna be a function which takes vertices of G and maps things to integers between one and N. Each of the numbers one through N should be taken on by exactly one vertex.
Here N is the number of vertices of G. So that's just the way to encode an ordering and then here's really the important property that every directed edge of G goes forward in the ordering.
"That is, if UV is a directed edge of the directed graph G, then it should be that."
The F value of the tail is less than the F value of the head.
"That is, this directed edge has a higher F value as you, as you traverse it in the correct direction."
Let me give you an example just to make this more clear.
So suppose we have this very simple directed graph with four vertices.
"Let me show you two different, totally legitimate topological orderings of this graph."
"So the first thing you could do is you could label S1,"
"V2, W3 and T4."
This corresponds to mapping these four vertices.
"Another option would be to label them the same way except you can swap the labels of, V and W. So if you want you can label V three and W two."
So again what these labeling meant to encode is an ordering of the vertices.
"So the blue labeling you can think of as encoding the ordering in which we put S first, then V, then W and then T. Whereas the green"
"labeling can be thought of as the same ordering of the nodes, except with W coming before V. What's important is that the pattern of the edge is exactly the same in both cases, and in particular, all of the edges go forward in this ordering."
"So, in either case, we have S with edges from S to V and S to W. So that looks the same way pictorially."
Whichever order V and W are in.
"And then symmetrically, there are edges from V and W to T. So you'll notice that no matter which order we put V and W in, all four of these edges go forward in each of these orderings."
"Now, if you're trying to put."
"V before S, it wouldn't work because the edge from S to V would be going backward, if V preceded S. Similarly, if you put T anywhere other than the final position, you would not have a topological ordering."
"So in fact, these are the only two topological orderings of this directed graph."
I encourage you to convince yourself of that.
Now who cares about topological orderings?
"Well this is actually a, a very useful subroutine this has been, come up in all kinds of applications."
"Really whenever you want a sequence, a bunch of tasks, when there's precedents constraints amongst them."
By precedents constraints I mean one task has to finished before another.
"You can think, for example, about the courses in some kind of undergraduate major, like computer science major."
"Here the vertices are going to correspond to all of the courses and there's a directed edge from course A to course B, if course A's a prerequisite for course B, if you have to take it first."
"So then, of course, you'd"
like to know a sequence in which you can take these courses so that you always take a course after you've taken its prerequisites.
"Now when you take your office as a doctor, if you want to see more patients in the short-run, they might be crammed into your office, and in the long-run you might build a bigger office."
"So in the short-run, how hard you work is variable."
"In the long-run, how big your office is is variable-- how many secretaries you hire, et cetera."
But your medical school spending is gone.
"That's not variable in the long-run, that's sunk."
"And that's a very important distinction is between basically these fixed costs, what we call fixed costs."
"Which are costs where, like the costs of the office and the machinery the physician uses, which can be changed over a 10-year period, versus sunk costs which once paid are gone forever."
"And the key reason, just to give you a hint about why these will matter, is because when firms set up this-- we may see firms in the market losing money."
You may see firms in the market losing money.
"In fact, in any point in time we see lots of firms in the market losing money."
"You might say, why don't they go out of business?"
The reason they don't go out of business is because they've already pay huge sunk costs.
It's not efficient to go out of business.
They've already invested a certain amount.
"It's not going to be efficient to go out of business, because then they'll give up the cost they've invested."
"So if you're a doctor, and you've spent all this money on med school, and you're not making money as a doctor in the first couple of years."
"If you quit and go do something else, you've just given up all the investment you made in med school."
"So if there's any prospect that eventually you'll make money, you might want to hang on and keep being a doctor."
So that's the difference between a fixed cost and a sunk cost.
"So I'm going to come back to that, but it's important to remember that distinction when we talk about competition."
"So let me stop there, and we'll come back on"
"Wednesday, I guess."
Have a good three-day weekend.
We'll come back on Wednesday and we'll talk about competition.
One of the things we of course are tremendously interested in is the whole idea of the Readymade.
We are familiar with the concept of junk sculpture.
"This is something that such artists as and even Picasso in earlier days more or less advanced, to pick up an object which was made for an entirely different use, possibly a discarded object, which because of its shape and its patination, its configuration, suggests another possibility."
"It may be a very satisfying texture, a very romantic kind of quality about the piece, in other words, it became a kind of chosen object but chosen for esthetic reasons."
In what respect does junk sculpture differ from the concept of the Readymade?
"Let's say for example, the Bottle Rack or the Bicycle Wheel?"
"This was of course the difficulty when it came to my mind but that was back in 1915, when I applied the word Readymade to these objects."
"In fact, I only made 13 of them in my life, in 40 years so it is not very much of an occupation."
So there's a little bit more memory.
The thing the Array is doing is it tends to be allocating extra slots that aren't being used.
So it's not usually tightly allocated either.
So in any given situation it could be as much as twice as big because it had that extra space.
So kind of in the tradeoff they tend to be in the same general range.
"This one has about twice the space, I think it's about four bites it has a four-byte pointer."
The thing's much bigger and it turns out actually this four bite pointer might be a smaller percentage of the overhead and will be a larger amount of the capacity in the excess case.
So for a lot of things they're going to be about the same range.
"And then there's a few isolated situations where, yeah, if you have very big things being stored having a lot of excess capacity is likely to be a more expensive part of the vector strategy than the link list."
But the
link list does have this built in overhead for every element.
"And so it's not the case where you would say right off the bat, well, definitely an array over link list because that the allocation space."
"It's like, hey, you have to think about the whole picture."
That is going to be the whole next lectures.
"Well, you know, it's about tradeoffs."
It's not that one strategy's always going to be the clearly better one.
"If it is, then we don't need to think about anything else."
There are times when you know that one is just great and there's no reason to think about anything else.
And then there's other times when there are reasons to think about different ways to solve the same problem.
So let me propose a case study that has some meat.
"You may think along the way, but you're going to really have to pretend that this is going to be relevant at first because it's going to seem like you've been transferred back to 1970, which was a very bad year, long before you born."
I want you to think about the idea of a text setter.
"So Microsoft Word, or you know your email send window, or"
"BB edit, or X code."
"All these things, right, have some backing of what usually is called a buffer, a buffer, sort of a funny word, right, but a buffer of characters behind it."
Okay.
And that buffer is used as the kind of document storage for all the characters that you're editing and moving around.
As you kind of bop around and move around there's something often called the cursor where you type characters and characters get moved as you insert.
"You can select things, and delete them, and cut, copy, and paste, and all that sort of stuff."
So what does that data structure look like?
What is the kind of thing that wants to back a buffer?
What kinds of things are important in that context to be able to support and what operations needs to be optimized for that tool to field [inaudible]?
"Now the problem here is that you have this selling of pollution rights as, as less costly than the setting of the standards."
But yet the politics calls all five firms to vote for the setting of the standards and the issue becomes one of how do we.
Courage firms to vote for the cheaper method of beating pollution.
"Well, there is one possibility that you can get concurrence from the five firms."
To switch firm setting standard to selling the pollution rights.
"As opposed to just setting the standard for polluting two units, why don't we."
Tell these firms that we're going to give you two pollution rights.
And you can use these pollution rights or you can sell these pollution rights.
What we know from pour graphical analysis that the equilibrium price.
"Is going to be $1500 and that is established by the intersection of the supply of pollution rights and the demand for pollution rights and the demand for pollution rights as a function of these, of these call structures and these call s tructures have not changed."
So we know the equilibrium price is going to be $1500.
"When you give the rights to pollute to the firms and then allow them to resell, if they want to resell them, well what is going to happen?"
"Well at $1500 per pollution right A is going to figure, well"
"I would prefer To sell one of my tickets, collect the $1500, and incur the cost of $800 to clean up and I'll be better off to the tune of $1500."
I will keep one right so I wont' have to incur this $1600 in cost.
"So a is gonna sell off one, one right. b is going to, Say B is going to do what?"
"It's going to buy one right, why?"
"Because it want's to lower its cost of abatement by 1,800 at a cost of the ticket for uh,1,500."
"C is going to, is going to."
"Well, C is gonna sell both rights."
"Why, because it can collect $3,000 from the selling of it's pollution rights, and then incur $1,800 to abate the pollution."
D?
Well D is gonna hang on to it's rights.
And keep them so it won't have to incur these costs.
Well E Is going to buy the is going to buy two pollution rights.
The result is that you get the exact same distribution of rights if you give the firms the right to pollute and then allow them to resell them.
"You get the same distribution as we got when the government was selling the, The rights and if you don't believe it, go back and replay this video lecture and see that the distribution here is exactly the same."
"But we also have a distribution, have a, have a system here, that's likely to be an improvement. over the government auction, as least as far as the bi perms are concerned."
Because bi perms get the rights free of charge.
And they can either use those rights or they can sell them.
"And if they use them it's just like the standard method, but if they sell them they, they can collect the fifteen hundred dollar price for the ticket."
"So if a firm keeps the rights and uses "" em, it must be better of then, then selling "" em for fifteen hundred."
"All those error terms have an h, so I'm going to collect all the h's at the end."
"The first error term is g prime of f of x, this term here, times the error of f at h."
"The next ones, plus the error of g, at this complicated quantity,"
"I was going to abbreviate hyphen, times f prime of x times h, I'm collecting all of these h's the end, plus the error term for g, at that complicated quantity, times the error for f at h, and all of that is times h."
Alright.
"Now, this is almost giving me the derivative of the composite function provided that I can control the size of this error term, right?"
"What I need to show now is that the limit as h approches 0 of this error term is really 0, and the error term, right, it's the part before th e times h, and it's g prime of f of x times the error term for f at h plus the error term for g times f prime of x, plus the error term for g times the error term for f at h."
"Now, why do I know that, that limit is equal to 0?"
"Well, I can do it in pieces, right?"
"It's the limit of the sum, so it's the sum of the limits. and I know that this first term is 0 because it's got an error f h term in it, and because f is differentiable, the error term goes to 0."
"I likewise know the same for this, alright?"
"This is, it also got an error f of h term in it."
The most mysterious term is this.
"But if you think a little bit more about it, the error of g at this hyphen thing, which I'm abbreviating this whole thing here, also goes to 0 as h goes to 0."
"And that's another thing to know that the limit as h goes to 0 of this quantity is 0 which is then enough to say that g of f of x plus h equals this quantity, actually implies that this is the derivative."
"So, here's what we've actually shown."
"Suppose that f is differentiable at a point a and g is differentiable at the point f of a, then the composite function, g composed with f, is differentiable at a, with the derivative of g of f at the point a, equal to the derivative of g at f of a times the derivative of f at a."
My name is Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad
President of the Strike Committee in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt.
"I ask bus workers in London to demand their rights, whatever it might cost."
"In any strike, the negotiators must be an elected committee of strikers."
If you have an appointed committee it won't get the workers their rights.
If it is an appointed committee of salaried officials its job will be to stop the strike.
The goal of an unelected committee of of negotiators is to stop the action.
So I urge bus workers in London to elect a committee to negotiate with the government because an unelected committee will not negotiate in the name of the workers.
The strike must be led by those elected by all the strikers.
"Our negotiators in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt are elected, not appointed."
"If they were appointed they wouldn't get us our rights, and would stop the strike."
"When we are building for a strike, we try to convince our colleagues that our demands are just and fair, and that we should win our rights."
"And if negotiations don't work, we'll call a strike."
"Strikes are a legitimate right of every citizen, even in London."
Every citizen in the world has the right to strike.
It's bringing it down into the soil.
It gets processed and de-nitrified and goes back up as
N_2.
There's some industrial fixation; the Bosch-Haber process is doing that.
"This runs off, gets into the ocean and fertilizes the ocean."
"If we look at the impact of nitrate and sulfate on human problems and on terrestrial ecosystems, one of the big ones is acid precipitation."
"So this stuff right here, all of human industry and cars and so forth, which in the United States has been concentrated in an area mostly roughly between Chicago and Pennsylvania, right here, this area, because of the-- remember our Hadley cells and the jet stream and the reason that the air is flowing from west to east across the continent-- all of that emission is getting picked up and it's getting dropped on lakes in Canada and the Northeastern United States."
"So in 1955 the pH in this region of the country, in freshwater bodies, had dropped to 4.6; that's starting to get pretty acid."
And by the way it was a much bigger problem for a lake that was sitting on granite than for a lake that was sitting on
limestone.
Why would it be more of a problem on granite than on
limestone?
Student:
Limestone's basic.
Prof:
Limestone's basic.
It's also a buffer.
So limestone will basically put a lot of carbonate into the water and buffer this.
"So this was a big problem, and in fact some lakes were"
losing all of their fish populations.
"However, there were improvements in air quality control around the country, and this has spread, but in many places it's also been ameliorated."
"I'd say it still remains a serious problem, and it's a situation that also causes international tensions, because basically Eastern Canada is getting hammered by"
"U.S. industrial and car emissions, because the flow of materials around the planet does not respect the arbitrary national boundaries that humans have created."
It's even worse in Europe.
"In Europe the industrial production of Germany, which creates a huge load of acid in the atmosphere, gets dumped on Scandinavia, which is old Scandinavian basalt shield; so they don't really have any"
limestone buffer up there in Scandinavia.
And that's one of the issues that gets talked a lot about in the European Union is how to equalize these kinds of costs.
"Because basically Canada is being treated as an externality by the United States, and Scandinavia is being treated as an externality by Germany."
So that sort of thing needs conflict resolution.
"Okay, water."
"The hydrological cycle is critical because you can't grow plants without water, and you can't grow humans without water either."
"And as the human population has gone up over five, and now through six billion, fresh water on the planet is becoming very, very scarce."
Now what does statement two tell us?
6 of the cans sit exactly along the length of the carton.
"So they're telling us that these cans, there's 6 cans that fit right along the length, which we figured out from statement number one."
But that also gives you the same information as statement number one.
Because you know that these are cylindrical cans.
I think it's a safe assumption to say that these are circles.
Yeah.
"A cylinder, you're assuming that the tops are circles."
"So if you say that 6 can fit that way, then you know that the diameter of each of them is 8 centimeters and then you can make the same argument that the diameter's 8 centimeters to say that 4 can fit the other way down."
"So two, alone, is also sufficient by itself."
"So the answer is, what is that, C?"
"Both statements-- no D, each statement, alone, is sufficient."

It is around now you're living out the cliche gringo fantasy of becoming an honorary native and leading the resistance forces but screw it.
And we raise the a little more.
And so I will show you now s- some of the results for maxima.
So I only go now for constructive interference.
And I have done this for three different distances.
"Those of you who are 5 meters away from me, 10 meters away from me, and 15 meters away from me."
"And what you see on the left side is going to be X, that is the linear separation, and these, so these were in meters, forgive me but I will do these in centimeters."
"And this is X1, if you are 5 meters away from me, you will have -- I will put X1 a"
"little lower than I have it now, you will see shortly why I put it a little lower -- X1, this is about 38 centimeters."
So the linear separation from one to the next is 38 centimeters.
"And you're 10 meters away, it's double that, that's no surprise, 76 centimeters."
And if you're 15 meters away it is 113 centimeters.
"And then X2, which is the position where you have another maximum, would be at 76 centimeters and it would be at 152 centimeters, and it would be at 228 centimeters if you're 15 meters away from me."
"So the minima will fall almost exactly in between, and so the minima where, in an ideal case there is no sound at all, sound plus sound gives silence, think about it, sound plus sound will give silence, will be when you are roughly at 19 centimeters, half of this, this will be 38 centimeters."
"Half of this, and here will be something like 57 centimeters."
"And you can calculate what these values are, they are exactly in between."
"And so the conclusion is that if you're 5 meters away from me and you're near the center line, but you can also be a little bit in this direction, that the separation between bright sound,"
"loud sound, which is always at zero of course in the middle, to silence is 19 centimeters."
And then you move another 19 centimeters and then you hear loud sound.
"If you are however 10 meters away from me, just past the cameras, then you have to move 38 centimeters to go from loud sound to silence."
"And if you're all the way in the audience, in the back of the audience, it's more like 60 centimeters."
And this is what we're going to do now together.
I want you all to stand up and I'm going to make you listen to 3000 hertz.
And what I want you to do when
"I turn on the two loudspeakers, I want you to move your head very slowly and try to find locations where you hear silence."
"The position of silence is extremely well-defined, so don't go too fast, you miss it, also keep in mind that there are reflections of the sound from the walls, and from the blackboard, and so the pattern that I have calculated here is not perfect."
But you will see that there will be locations where sound plus sound will give you silence.
[tone]
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
[tone]
You are a couple of lousy scientists.
"If the separation between a lot of sound and silence is 19 centimeters, that's about the separation of your ears, you dummies, so one ear could be at a maximum, the other ear could be at a minimum, so at least close one ear."
How can that be?
"We just computed that on the one hand I, we I thought we had this symmetry relation."
Relativity tells us that if the black twin sees the blue clock running slow so does the blue twin see the black clock running slow.
What ruins relativity here?
"Well, when you think about it."
It's pretty clear that these two twins are not related by Lorentz Transformation.
"They were related by Lorentz Transformation, as long as twin number one, two was moving to the right at this constant speed, v. But there is a big difference in their life histories."
"And the big difference occurs, of course, here, at this instant."
Twin
Number two jumped from one spaceship to the other.
He was not inertial.
At that instant twin number two was actually accelerating.
"Not only that but as I drew it, since his velocity changed instantaneously the rate of change of his velocity was infinite."
He was experiencing an infinite acceleration.
"So that's not very realistic, but it makes the calculation simple."
But this is why the.
"Life history of the two twins is different, it's different and it's not, you don't expect symmetry if blue thinks black clock runs slow then black thinks blue clock runs slow, the difference is that one of them accelerated and the one who accelerated will be younger and this is brought out by drawing some auxiliary world lines here, so what I've done is at this event, event number one."
"I took, I drew before the t double prime axis the world line of the moving twin as h e returns."
I can now draw the auxiliary light cone and therefore the x double prime axis.
And here we see the resolution to the mystery because remember before I suggested that we introduce event number two over here which is.
What is this?
"This event is from the point of view of the blue twin of the, the moving twin as long as he is moving away from earth, event number two is simultaneous with event number one."
"So if these guys were exchanging messages then indeed when he decided to change The, to, to jump ships."
"The moving twin was, would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was."
And in just as the stationary twin would have been convinced that his brother was younger than he was.
"Until that point, everybody's inertial, and life is symmetric."
But at the moment that he jumps ships.
"What happens is that, now, simul-, what he considers, when he's moving to the left, to be simultaneous with this same event #one is actually event #three over here."
Is line of simultaneity changed because you changed velocities instantaneously.
"So in particular over the instantaneous jump from ship to ship, his brother aged this much."
All of this aging took place essentially instantaneously during the instant that the moving twin jumped chips.
"This is the resolution.This is where the symmetry is broken, indeed this segment."
"And of course as soon as you bring a node into the set X, into the [inaudible] territory, you have to commit or Dijkstra's algorithm chooses to commit to a shortest path distance and a shortest path."
"What is the definition of its shortest path distance, as computed by"
Djikstra?
Well it's just a degree score.
"So it's going to assign the vertex t the shortest path distance of minus two, and the path is going to be just the arc S t."
But notice that this is in fact wrong.
"The shortest path distance from S to t is not minus two, in this graph."
"There is another path, namely the one that goes thorough V that has length minus four, less than minus two."
"So, [inaudible] computes incorrect shortest path distances on this trivial 3-note graph."
"So t o summarize the story so far, We've described Dijkstra's algorithm."
I've shown you that it works in a very simple example that doesn't have negative edge lines and I've showed you that it doesn't work in and even simpler example that does have negative edge
lines.
"So, I've both given you some plausibility that it might work generally at least for non negative edges links."
But I've also tried to sew some seeds of doubt that it's not an all clear if at this point if Dijkstra's algorithm is always clear correct or not even if you have non-negative edge lengths and certainly if it is always correct there better be a fool proof argument to why.
You should be demanding and explanation of a claim If Dijkstra's is correct in any kind of generality.
That's the subject of the next video.
Now let's find the sum of squares for within subject variability.
This one's a
little harder.
We take the sum of each value and subtract the respective mean.
Then square it.
Then we add them all together.
This is a little trickier.
You need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respected mean.
Square them and then add them all up.
Do the same for every sample.
And then add up each sum of squares.
"You're welcome to enter your calculations here, but that part won't be graded."
Only the complete sum of squares for within groups will be graded.
"There are many people who experience discrimination in healthcare here in Oregon, but members of our transgender communities face healthcare discrimination at a systemic and unparalleled level."
"As the mayor mentioned, the American Medical Association has identified transgender health care as being medically necessary."
"Yet many transgender Oregonians are routinely denied the ability to even purchase health insurance, or are denied the coverage for basic medically necessary care solely on the basis of their gender identity."
"Threw all of that type A energy into having kids, and we had four kids in just over five years."
(Laughter)
"And I was busy nuking those Dino Nuggets, (Laughter) serving flourescent mac and cheese, and blue yogurt."
I didn't want anybody telling me what to feed my kids;
I didn't want anybody telling me what to eat.
"And then one morning, five years ago, over breakfast, everything changed, and our youngest child had an allergic reaction."
I was so clueless.
"As I raced her to the pediatrician's office, she said, ""Robyn, what did you feed the kids for breakfast?"""
"And I said, ""Well, tubes of blue yogurt,"
"L'Eggo my Eggo waffles, and scrambled eggs."""
"And she said, ""Well, those are three of the top eight allergens,"" and she starts rattling off these statistics about food allergies."
"And I had totally rolled my eyes at the whole thing, and I thought, ""Since when?"" because I hadn't known anybody with a food allergy when I was a kid, and I didn't understand why all of the sudden a PB&amp;amp;J and a carton of milk were loaded weapons on a lunch room table."
"So as I got everything under control and I got the kids back down, and everybody was down for a nap that day, every analytical gene in my body went off, and I wanted to see the data."
And that morning I learned that from 1997 until 2002 there'd been a doubling of the peanut allergy.
I learned that one out of 17 kids under the age of three then had a food allergy.
"I learned that one in three American kids now has allergies, autism,"
"ADHD, or asthma."
"And I later went on to learn, according to the CDC, there'd been a 265 percent increase in the rate of hospitalizations related to food allergies."
That was people checked in to the ER - big kids and little ones.
That wasn't somebody making it up.
"And as I learned that a food allergy is when your body sees food as foreign, and launches an inflammatory response to drive out that foreign invader, it just begged the question, is there something foreign in our food that wasn't there when we were kids?"
I don't think anything really could have prepared me for the answer that I found.
"Because as I dug into the data, I learned that in 1994, in order to drive profitability for the food industry, scientists genetically engineered an E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone to help a cow make more milk."
"The analyst in me - it made perfect sense: you drive profitability for the dairy industry, there's the argument you can lower the cost of milk, who can stand in front of that?"
"But at the same time, I kept coming back to the fact we were genetically engineering E. coli bacteria to create an artificial growth hormone that we were injecting into our dairy cows."
And we were the only developed country in the world that did it.
"Canada, the UK, all 27 countries in Europe,"
"Australia, New Zealand, Japan - they all said, ""This has never been proven safe."""
"The product label for the product said that it caused fertility problems, reproductive problems, mastitis, ovarian cysts."
"It resulted in an increased antibiotic use in animals, and so for that reason, these countries never allowed it."
"And yet, we did."
"And then studies started to come out showing that it elevated hormone levels that were linked to breast, prostate, and colon cancer."
"So the new path is just the SVW Path, okay?"
So [inaudible] we computed the shortest path from S to W in this graph.
So now we proceed to the final iteration of Dijkstra's algorithm.
We know what vertex we're going to bring into X. It's gonna be the vertex T. That's the only one left.
But we still have to compute by which edge we discover T and bring it into the set X. So we have to compute the [inaudible] score for each of the two crossing arcs...
VT and WT.
"And in this final iteration the score for the arc (V, T) is unchanged."
"So this is still gonna be the a value of its tail, one, plus the length of the arc, six."
So the score here is still seven.
"And now, for the first time, WT is a crossing edge of the frontier, and when we compute its score, it's the a value of its tail W, which is three, plus the length of this arc, which is three, so we get a rescore of six."
"So by Dijkstra's greedy criterion, we pick the edge wt instead of the edge VT, and of course, that doesn't matter who gets brought into X, but it does matter how we compute the A and B values for T."
So in the final iration.
"We compute AT to be the Dijkstra greedy score of the edge that we picked, which is the edge, WT and the score was six."
So we compute the shortest path distance from S to T to be six.
And then what is the path itself?
"Well, we inherit the shortest path from the tail of the arc that we used to discover T. So that's the shortest path to W, which we previously computes as being the path through V. And then we append the edge we used to discover T, so we append the edge, WT."
"So the shortest path from S to T, we're going to compute as the zig-zag path."
"S. Goes to V, goes to T, Sorry, Goes to W, goes to T. And then now indeed X is all the vertices."
We've computed it for everything.
This is our final output.
"The contents of the, especially the A array, this, the final output."
Shortest path distances from S to all of the four possible destinations.
"And if you go back and compare this to the example you went through to the quiz, you will see at least on this example, indeed."
"Dijkstra's algorithm corrects pa, the shortest path distances."
"Now, I've said it before and I'll say it again."
"If someone shows you their algorithm works just on some example, especia lly a pretty simple four note example, you should not jump to the conclusion that this algorithm always works."
"Sometimes the algorithms work fine on small examples, but break down once you go to more interesting complicated examples."
"So I definitely owe you a proof that Dijkstra's algorithm works not only in this network, but in any network."
"And actually, it doesn't work in any network."
It's only gonna work in any network with non-negative edge lengths.
"So to help you appreciate that, Let's conclude this video with a nonexample showing what goes wrong in Dijkstra's algorithm when you have networks with negative edge lengths."
"So before I actually give you a, a real non example let me just answer preliminary question which you might have and should be have very good question if it something that's occurred to you."
Steven:
So this is a painting that really does show the opulence of imperial France.
The moment that's being represented is clearly intermission.
The chandelier has been lowered into the space of the audience.
"The lights are up, and so the audience's gaze has shifted from the stage to themselves."
Beth:
"So Cassatt's family, although it was very wealthy, actually her father refused to support her desire to be an artist, and although he paid for her basic living expenses, refused to support her art supplies and her studio where she painted."
Steven:
"This, despite real support from the leading artists of the day."
"She was a close friend of Degas, who had enormous respect for her ability, and she was an extraordinary painter, in every way a peer of the great impressionist painters in Paris."
Beth:
This painting displays a virtuoso technique.
"Mary Cassatt gained her knowledge of painting from a variety of sources, but it was difficult because she was a woman."
Steven:
"Her first formal classes were at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art, but women were not allowed to study from the nude, even from within the context of art school."
Beth:
"And like many artists of her generation, they moved to Paris where there was a little bit more freedom for women who were aspiring artists."
"Although she couldn't enter the Ăcole des Beaux-Arts because she was a woman, she did enter the private studio of several accomplished artists and studied with them."
Steven:
"But the world was still a restrictive one for her, even in Paris, and she was not, for instance, able to spend time with her friends like Degas at the cafes."
"We see that, actually, reflected in her subject matter, which tends to be domestic, or perhaps a night out at the opera."
Beth:
"It's difficult, I think, to remember those restrictions for women when we look at this painting because there's an extraordinary sense of freedom about the woman who's depicted here."
She's leaning back on her right elbow.
"There's a strong diagonal that has a sense of informality and movement, real self-confidence"
Steven:
"The woman with a pearl necklace, perhaps Lydia seems so much her own agent in the world, and it really does remind us of the tensions that existed at the end of the 19th century, as women were really entering into the public space."
"You know that the tension between public and private is played out, not only in terms of the subject matter, not only the fact that they're in a kind of semi-private space within this booth in the public space of the opera house, but also in the contrast between light and shadow that plays across Lydia's body."
Look at the way the light picks up only the side of her face.
The front of her face is in shadow.
"Not only is it rather brave on Cassatt's part, but it also speaks to the representation of bourgeois culture, this notion of privacy and its importance, even as one views the stage with others."
Beth:
Not only with the poor but also with young people.
"Because in Davos, I saw that the owners of technology are mostly young."
"And so, the young people own the future."
"And so, and these are exciting times."
"I realize that that's also, you know, what innovation is about."
"Always have aspirations, always have hope so that - because aspiration drives innovation, invention and creation."
Thank you.
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.
"Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing for penetration testing purposes."
"And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with random testing sort of in the general software robustness."
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
"On many an occasion I've been camping in the Adirondacks, and one of my favorite periods is right at dusk, when the lake becomes absolutely glass-like."
"The sun is setting but you can still see the silhouettes of trees - all these conical spires, beautiful reflection on the water with the last few bits of sunlight."
And then you hear the wail of a loon.
"You'll hear one individual of the pair give this long, mournful wail, which is essentially saying,"
"""I'm here."
"Where are you?"""
"Generally, moments later, you'll hear the response from the other member of the pair giving its wail, saying,"
"""I'm over here."""
Loons are active at night.
"You can be out in a beautiful Adirondack lake after dark, or a northern Minnesota lake, and this is one of the characteristic, evocative sounds you're going to hear from that area - something that'll stick with you for the rest of your life."
"It just punctuates the fall of night and really sets the mood for what follows: the solitude, the peacefulness."
It's all wrapped up in that one vocalization.
Thorotrast was a contrast medium used in Germany since 1890.
"It was used in Japan since 1930, but it was found that 25 to 30% of people developed liver cancer 20 to 30 years later."
Why does it take so long before cancer develops?
Thorotrast is an alpha-radiation nuclide.
"Alpha radiation injures nearby cells, and the DNA that is harmed most is a gene called ""P53""."
"We now know, thanks to genome science, the entire sequence of human DNA."
"However, there are 3 million locations on the DNA that are different from person to person."
"So today, it doesn't make sense at all to proceed as if all humans are the same."
"The basic principle should be the ""personalized medicine"" when we look at internal radiation - which DNA is damaged, and what kind of change is taking place."

Highland Football League
"The Highland Football League (HFL) is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands, as the name may suggest, but also in the north-east lowlands (Moray and Aberdeenshire). It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association."
History.
Formation.
"The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle."
Recent History.
"Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland."
"The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate."
"In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected."
"On February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club."
Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.
"The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous."
Linked Competitions.
The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs. These competitions are:
Meselson–Stahl experiment
"The Meselson–Stahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, using ""E. coli"" DNA."
"With their experiment, they found that DNA replication was semiconservative. The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, that is called ""synthesis""."
There are three different way this replication could happen:
"Meselson and Stahl found that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They put the bacteria in an environment with a Nitrogen isotope. They first used N15. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N14. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all v. Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N14."
Woodford tube station
"Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom."
The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell.
History.
The ancient Greeks called the Great Pyramid one of the seven wonders of the world. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them are on the western side of the River Nile. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the Egyptian pharaohs went to the stars to join their gods in the afterlife.
Pyramids in the Americas.
The Aztecs and Mayans also built many massive pyramids. None are as old or big as the oldest or biggest Egyptian pyramids. Most of them are step pyramids.
"Unlike Egyptian pyramids, which were used as tombs for rulers and wealthy people, Aztec and Mayan pyramids are believed to have been used for public displays of human sacrifice."
Other pyramids.
"There are also ancient pyramids in other parts of Africa, Central America, Europe, North America, and Asia. There is a famous modern glass pyramid in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada is also a glass pyramid."
Care Bears
"The Care Bears are a very successful toy franchise from the 1980s. Over forty million of these stuffed teddy bears, made with a variety of colours, were sold from 1983 to 1987. Each Bear had a name, a job, and a symbol tied to it. For example, Funshine Bear helps people wake up, and has a sun on his stomach."
"The toys were first made as characters on cards in 1981; the original artwork was done by James Lewis. Later, other toys called the Care Bear Cousins were introduced."
"They also gave way to three animated movies for the cinema in the mid-1980s. A related TV series from DIC and, later, Canada's Nelvana Limited came out at almost that same time."
"Recently, Care Bear toys have been brought back in a new edition for the twenty-first century. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in their first two DVD movies (both computer-animated), as well as a few video games."
Bolzano
"Bolzano (; ; , Southern Bavarian: ""Bozn"") is the capital city of the province of Province of Bolzano-Bozen in northern Italy's Alto Adige."
Data.
"Its population is 98.057 (March 2005) and the area of the municipality is 52.34 km2. Bolzano has a history of Italian-speaking inhabitants since the Middle Ages. The region of Alto Adige/Südtirol is mainly German speaking, but in the city the Italian speaking population was the majority (75%) in 2001. The German speaking population of the city was 24% and the Ladin speaking less than 1%. Actually the foreign-born are around 7% (mostly are from eastern Europe)."
"Historically between the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated by neolatins from the time of the Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanisation. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present area of South Tyrol (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin. After the Italian victory in WWI the Italian government promoted a huge immigration of Italians in the city, that was fully modernized with new areas and with the creation of an industrial section: since then the Italians are the majority and in the 2011 census they were nearly 77% of the total population."
"Bolzano actually is an international city with a trilingual English-German-Italian university (Free University of Bolzano), the European Academy (EURAC), a Business Innovation Centre (BIC), an international airport (ABD, daily flights to Rome and Munich), the ""Bolzano Fair Area"", the Archaeology Museum with the Frozen Fritz (the Iceman called here Ötzi), other important museums, the famous ""Monumento alla Vittoria"" and an old Tyrolean medieval centre with the typical alpine arcades (""Portici""-Lauben)."
"Bolzano is the centre of the ""Euregio Tirol-Südtirol/Alto Adige-Trentino"" and with Innsbruck is the capital of the ""Alps Convention""."
City districts and neighboring communities.
Bolzano has five city districts:
"Communities next to Bozen are: Appiano, Cornedo, Laives, Deutschnofen, Renon, Genesio, Terlan, and Vadena."
"Other important towns near Bozen are: Bressanone, Brunico and Merano."
Flubber
"Flubber is a 1997 American science-fiction comedy film directed by Les Mayfield (who had previously directed another John Hughes scripted remake, ""Miracle on 34th Street"") and written by Hughes, based on an earlier screenplay by Bill Walsh. A remake of ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" (1961), the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton, and Clancy Brown with Jodi Benson providing a voice. The film grossed $178 million worldwide despite negative reviews. In selected theaters, the ""Pepper Ann"" episode ""Old Best Friend"" was featured before the film."
Mary Wollstonecraft
"Mary Wollstonecraft (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was a British writer. She was born in Spitalfields, a daughter of a rich farmer who inherited his fortune. Her father was known because he was sometimes violent towards her, her four siblings, and their mother when his farms failed. Mary Wollstonecraft was the second oldest child in her family. She was the oldest female child. She left home at the age of nineteen to work and become independent."
"Working in the English city of Bath, Somerset, she developed a disliking for the upper class and their social lives. In 1784 she experienced the near death of her sister Eliza who was also the victim of abuse at the hands of her husband. She escaped with her sister to London to preserve her life. Soon after, her good friend Fanny Blood, died of complications in childbirth. Wollstonecraft suffered depression following this and being in financial straits, she began to write her first book ""Thoughts on the Education of Daughters"". Then she wrote """"."

Gustave Courbet
Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. His paintings made social comment on the world around him.
"Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters."
Early life.
"Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting."
"When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life."
"In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time.83"
Success.
"Courbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called ""After Dinner at Ornans"", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government.32 Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. This rule was changed in 1857.55 Courbet's work, and the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as ""Realism"". Like the Dutch painters he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings."
"""Stone Breakers""."
"In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend ""It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning."""
The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.31
"""A Burial at Ornans""."
"Courbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the ""Coronation of Napoleon"" and showed all the people who were present."
"Some people praised ""The Funeral at Ornans"" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies.4 Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: ""The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism."""
"Courbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a ""terrible socialist"", and a ""savage"".8"
Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850:
"During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as ""Village Damsels"" (1852), the ""Wrestlers"" (1853), ""Bathers"" (1853), ""The Sleeping Spinner"" (1853), and ""The Wheat Sifters"" (1854)."
"""The Artist's Studio""."
"Courbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called ""The Artist's Studio"" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor."
"In 1855 Coubet took this picture, with ""Burial at Ornan"" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called ""Exposition Universelle"". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings.52 Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures.84 Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France."
Later life.
In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to the exhibition. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses.52
"For the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called ""The Origin of the World"" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into large paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty."
"At this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking."

"Two key problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the H-Block hunger strikers, two of Thomas McElwee's sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting; Mary said to the media outside that ""he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions"". FitzGerald then ordered Gardaí to remove the families from the meeting."
"In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months, in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a working majority."
Taoiseach 1982–87.
Constitutional reform.
"As Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society. His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws."
"A controversial Pro-Life Amendment (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the ""Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother"", was added to the Irish constitution—against FitzGerald's advice—in a 1983 national referendum."
Northern Ireland.
"FitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. It provided the incentive for the reopening of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985."
"While the Agreement was rejected and criticised by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the Irish and British governments which, in time, would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and, subsequently, the republican and loyalist cease-fires."
Infighting and declining support.
"In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election, and Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach."
Post-Taoiseach period.
"FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, and retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, died before him in 1999; after that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in ""The Irish Times"", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs."

Belle-Isle-en-Terre
"The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700 km wide.p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today."
Change of climate.
"The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate."
"The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.p30"
Structure.
"""Lepidodendron"" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged."
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin.
"The scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of ""Lepidodendron"" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark."
"""Lepidodendron"" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk."
"The branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. ""Lepidodendron"" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores."
Stigmaria.
"Stigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks. They were the roots of coal forest lycopsid trees such as ""Sigillaria"" and ""Lepidodendron"". Each trunk had four of those roots. ""Stigmaria"" is a ""form taxon"", as the genus and species of the plant bearing the root cannot be identified."
DuPont
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (often DuPont) is an American chemical company. Eleuthère Irénée du Pont founded it in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill. DuPont was the world's third largest chemical company based on market capitalization and ninth based on revenue in 2009. Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the cooling industry and later, more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair."
"Some of DuPont's trademarked brands have become genericized. For instance, “neoprene” was originally intended to be a trademark, but quickly came into common usage."

Puyi
"Aisin-Giro Puyi or Emperor Puyi (, February 7, 1906–October 17, 1967) was the last Emperor of China. He was crowned emperor in 1908 at the age of three. His era name as Qing emperor, ""Xuantong"", means ""proclamation of unity"". On February 12, 1912, during the Xinhai Revolution, he was forced to abdicate. He later became the ruler of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo during World War II. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs."
"When he was two years old, in 1908, he became the Xuantong Emperor (then spelled as Hsuan Tung Emperor). At the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. He was forced to give up all political power, but he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City. In turn, he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City."
"In 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses."
"After Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to stop the treasury from getting robbed. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft. He also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace."
"In 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria in 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. Chinese media and writers accused the Japanese and collaborators like Puyi of being homosexuals as an insult."
"After the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China. For the next ten years, the former emperor was in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards said that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing. He spent the rest of his life there as a common citizen. He worked as a gardener and then an editor. He earned 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home."
Lithium (Nirvana song)
"""Lithium"" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana which featured on their second album ""Nevermind"". Kurt Cobain wrote the song. He said the song is about a man who became religious after his girlfriend died."
Endocrinology
Endocrinology studies the working of the endocrine system and hormones.
"It is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in."
The endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.
"Hormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology."
Medical aspects.
"Medical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone."
An endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:
These are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.
Work can mean different things depending on how the word is used.
Romania
"Romania (old spelling: Rumania, Roumania; , ) is a country in southeastern Europe. It is north of the Balkan Peninsula, on the Lower Danube River. Western Romania is circled by the Carpathian Mountains. Romania also has a border on the Black Sea. Most of the Danube Delta is found inside Romania. Romania shares borders with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine to the far northeast, the Republic of Moldova to the near northeast, and Bulgaria to the south."
"Romania is a semi-presidential unitary state. It was created when Moldavia and Wallachia joined together in 1859. It was given its independence in the Treaty of Berlin of 1878. At the end of World War II, some of its land (close by what is now known as Moldova) was occupied by the USSR. After the Iron Curtain fell in 1989 Romania was liberated from the communist regime. During the 2000s, Romania made changes to the country, such as reform the democratic system, human rights acts, freedom of speech acts, economy and law. That let Romania join the European Union on January 1, 2007."
"Romania has the 9th biggest area of land and the 7th biggest population (with 19 million people) of the European Union member states. The capital and biggest city in Romania is Bucharest ( ), with a population of 1.6 million. One of the cities in Transylvania, Sibiu, was named a European Capital of Culture. Romania joined NATO on March 29, 2004."
Origin.
"The word ""Romania"" (""Rumania"" or ""România"") comes from the Romanian word ""Român"", which comes from the Latin word ""Romanus"" which means ""Roman"". English texts still used the word ""Rumania"" during World War II. This came from the French word ""Roumanie""."
History.
Prehistory and the Romans.
"Some of the oldest human remains found in Europe were discovered in Romania. They were about 42,000 years old. This may have been when the first Homo sapiens came to Europe."
"The world's first and oldest writing comes from people who lived in today's Romania. Approximately 5300 years BC. According to archaeology it is not a matter of symbols, but the world's first writings. It belonged to the Vinča culture which inhabited all of today's Serbia with over 150 Vinča sites and minor parts of Western Romania, northwestern Bulgaria, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Southeastern Hungary."
"Herodotus in the fourth book of The Histories, written in about 440 . Herodotus wrote that the Getae were defeated by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great when he battled the Scythians. The Getae were called the Dacians by the Romans. They were Thracians who were living in Dacia, which is where Romania, Moldova and the northern part of Bulgaria are now. The Dacians attacked the Roman province, the border of which was formed by the Danube, in 87 . This was during Emperor Domitian's rule. The Dacians were defeated by the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan in two battles that lasted from 101 until 106 . The Roman Empire made Dacia into the province of Roman Dacia."
"A lot of ore, such as gold and silver, were found in Roman Dacia. A lot of gold and silver were found in the Western Carpathians. Trajan went back to Rome with 165 tons (330,000 pounds) of gold and 330 tons (660,000 pounds) of silver after his conquest."
There were many Romans living in the province of Roman Dacia. They spoke Vulgar Latin. They began to write the local languages using the Latin alphabet. Writing languages with the Latin alphabet is called romanization. This became the first version of Romanian.
"In the 3rd century, the province was attacked by groups of nomadic people like the Goths. They made the Roman Empire leave Dacia about 271 . This became the Roman Empire's first abandoned province."
The origin of modern Romanians is widely talked about by historians to this day. It is thought that the Romanians were formed from large ethnic groups that came from both the south and north parts of the Danube.
Dark Ages and Middle Ages.
"From 271 to 275, the Goths took over the abandoned Roman province. They lived in Dacia until the 4th century, when another group of wandering peoples, the Huns, came to Dacia. The Gepids, Avars, with the Slavic people, were in control of Transylvania through the 8th century. In the 8th century, however, the country was taken over by the Hungarian Empire. It was made part of the First Bulgarian Empire, which ended Romania's Dark Ages."
"The Bulgarians held Transylvania until the 11th century. The Pechenegs, the Cumans, and the Uzes were a few of the people later noted in the history of Romania."
"In 1310, now called the High Middle Ages, Basarab I started the Romanian principality of Wallachia. Moldavia was begun by Dragoş around 1352. During the Middle Ages, Romanians were living in three different areas: Wallachia (Romanian: ""Ţara Românească""—""Romanian Land""), Moldavia (Romanian: ""Moldova""), and Transylvania."
"Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary from around the 10th century until the 16th century, when it turned into the Principality of Transylvania. This lasted until 1711. Wallachia had been on the border of the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century. As the Ottoman Empire's influence grew, it gradually fell under the suzerainty (control) of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century."
"The best known ruler of this period was Vlad III the Impaler, also known as Vlad Dracula, or """", , Prince of Wallachia, during the years of 1448, 1456–62, and 1476. While he was the leader of his people, he had an agreement with the Ottoman Empire to stay independent. Many people in Romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country."
"Moldavia was at its greatest when Stephen the Great was ruling between 1457 and 1504. He was a great military leader, winning 47 battles and losing only 2. After every battle he won, Stephen would build a church. Because he won 47 of the battles that he fought, he ended up building 48 churches. After Stephen the Great's death, Moldavia came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century."
Independence and monarchy.
"When Transylvania was the organic part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire was in control of Wallachia and Moldavia, almost all of the Romanians had limited rights as a citizen. They stayed this way even when they made up most of the people in those areas."
"After the even more violent Revolution of 1848 did not succeed, so explained the Great Powers did not like the idea of Romania becoming a free nation and it was not a real possibility."
The people who voted in 1859 in Moldavia and Wallachia picked the same person – Alexandru Ioan Cuza – to be the prince in those areas. He managed to unite the people and nationalism was seen as a useful method.
Alexandru Ioan Cuza walked with cautious steps he was not proclaiming a declaration of independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war. Instead he let Moldavia and Wallachia merged in the United Principalities of the Ottoman Empire and increasing self-government to a greater degree.
"The new union was at the front of today's Romania. With cautious steps we freed itself more and Bucharest was established as the capital. However, farmers had more land when serfdom was abolished, which led to a coup d'état against the Alexandru Ioan Cuza staged by peasants who overthrew the regime."
"Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became the new leader, and was later called Prince Carol I of Romania. While the Russo-Turkish War was happening, Romania battled on the Russian side. When the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was signed, the Great Powers made Romania an independent state. In return, they had to give Russia three of their southern districts of Bessarabia. In 1881, the principality became a kingdom, with Prince Carol ruling as King Carol I."
The World Wars and the Great Leaders.
"John of Damascus studied religion. He also studied law, theology, philosophy and music. He is said by some sources to have served as a Chief Administrator to the Muslim caliph of Damascus before he became a priest. He wrote works about Christianity. He composed hymns that are still used by Greek Orthodox churches around the world. He is considered ""the last of the Fathers"" of the Eastern Orthodox church. He is best known for arguing to let people use pictures of Greek Orthodox saints, which are called ""icons"". He is also honored by Catholic churches, specifically the Roman Catholic Church."
Pope Leo IV
Pope Saint Leo IV (790 – 17 July 855) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 10 April 847 until he died in 855.
"He was born in Rome. He died in Rome on 17 July 855 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. There was a medieval tradition that had claimed that a woman, Pope Joan, had succeeded him by disguising herself as a man but she is believed to be fictitious."

She also played Helen in the 2012 melodrama movie ""Jack Reacher"". Her role in ""Gone Girl"" got her an Academy Award nomination. Pike was born in London."
Pope John XV
Pope John XV (??? − March 996) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from August 985 to his death in 996.
"He was born in Rome, Papal States and died in March 996 in Rome, Papal States, Holy Roman Empire."
"During his time as pope, there was a dispute that arose over the deposition in 991 of Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims. Arnulf was made archbishop of Reims in 988 by Hugh Capet of France. Arnulf was the nephew of the King's bitter rival, Charles of Lorraine and considered Arnulf a turncoat. He demanded his deposition by John XV. Hugh Capet captured both Charles and Archbishop Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. He deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Abbot Gerbert of Aurillac who would later be known as Pope Silvester II."
"At the synod, Arnulf, Bishop of Orléans accused John XV:"

Black Friday
"Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. Even though it falls on a Friday, which is the last day before the weekend, and comes right after Thanksgiving Thursday, it is not a federal holiday. There are some states, however, that observe this day instead of Columbus Day for workers of the state government."
"The name ""Black Friday"" started to be used sometime after World War II, but it was not popular outside of Philadelphia until around 1975"
Traditions.
"Many Americans see Black Friday as the official beginning of the Christmas holiday season, a time when many people go shopping for gifts to give to their family and friends on Christmas Day. On Black Friday, many stores have big sales, and it is common to see long lines of people waiting outside stores and in malls to get the best deals first before they run out. Because of this, stores usually open around 6 am in the morning or later. Some stores, though, started opening at 5 am and even 4 am in the late 20th century. Now, a few stores even open at midnight. Shoppers like to stay out all day to get what they need, making Black Friday the busiest shopping day of the year."
"On the first Monday after the long weekend is Cyber Monday, when many people go online shopping."
Lions in heraldry
"Lions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal. It traditionally symbolises bravery, valour, strength, and royalty."
"They may appear as a charge on the shield or as a crest. They are described in the ""blazon"" (heraldic description) by their ""tincture"" (color) and ""attitude"" (position). Sometimes the teeth and claws of a lion can be colored differently from the rest of its body; it is said to be ""armed"" of that color (e.g. ""A lion Or armed gules"" is a gold lion with red teeth and claws). Sometimes the tail is even described, if it is shown in an unusual way. One reason why lions are shown in so many different ways is because when heraldry developed, a lot of people wanted a lion on their coat of arms, but no two coats of arms can be the same. The purpose of heraldry in the Middle Ages was to identify people with bold images over the outside of their armour. Since a lot of people started putting lions on their coats of arms, they placed them in a lot of different positions and in every color used in heraldry. In France and Germany, they even made patterns of colors on some of their lions, as if they were painted."
"French heralds refer to lions in the walking positions as ""leopards"", but this term is seldom used by British heralds."
Attitudes.
"Although there are many ""attitudes"" or positions now used in heraldry, very few of these were known to medieval heralds, who simply wanted to draw a lion to fill the space provided on the shield. The following table describes the different attitudes of heraldic lions:"
"Other terms are used to describe the lion's position in further detail. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, (facing left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's ""whole body"" is turned to face right, he is ""to sinister"" or ""contourné"". If his ""whole body"" faces the viewer, he is ""affronté"". If his ""head only"" faces the viewer he is ""guardant"" or ""gardant"", and if he looks back over his shoulder (body facing left but head turned to face right) he is ""regardant"". These words follow the main description of position, and then the lion is further described as ""armed"" (teeth and claws) of another color, if another color is used. And finally, the tail may be described if it is unusual. A lion (or other beast) ""coward"" carries its tail between its hind legs. The tail also may be ""nowed"" (knotted), or the lion may be ""queue fourchée"" (forked tail) or ""double-queued"" (two tails)."
"The population of Trieste, practically nearly all Italian, promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918, and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called ""Venezia Giulia""."
"The population is 207.069 ab. (2004). It was nearly 300,000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus."
"These days, Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry, science parks, universities and ""history on the border of western Europe"". Trieste will be connected to the Italian ""TAV railway"" (High Speed) network: a 300 km/hour (186 mph) fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next few years."
Economy.
"During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the city's annexation to Italy following World War I, because it was cut off from the ""Mittleurope""."
"But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous ""Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)""). Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards)."
"As a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has had a huge economic boom, thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal, steel works and an oil terminal."
"Trieste is also Italy's and Mediterranean's (and one of Europe's) greatest coffee ports, as the city supplies more than 40% of Italy's coffee. Coffee brands, such as Illy, were founded and are headquartered in the city. Currently, Trieste is one of Europe's most important ports and centres for trade and transport, with Trieste being part of the ""Corridor 5"" plan, to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries."
Offenbach am Main
"Offenbach is a city in the German state of Hesse. It is on the river Main near Frankfurt am Main. The city has about 120,000 people. The ""Deutscher Wetterdienst"" (German weather service) is in Offenbach."
Economy.

Twinned cities.
Offenbach has the following twin cities:
Heilbronn
"Heibronn ( ]; , local dialect: ""Hallbrunn"", ""Haalbrunn"") is a city in Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. With about 117,000 people, Heilbronn is the sixth largest town in Baden-Württemberg."
Heilbronn is also on the river Neckar and is known for the wine which was grown in their region and the Kätchen a famous sign.
Hildesheim
"is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30 km southeast of Hanover. The city is on the banks of the River Innerste, which is a smaller river that flows into the River Leine. It can be reached from Autobahn A7, which links Kassel, Göttingen and Hanover."
"It has about 110,000 people living there."
History.
"Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany. The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford, where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (""Alter Markt""), which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important. The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000. When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well. In 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province."
"The city was bombed in World War II, but the bombing had little importance in the course of the war. 28.5% of the houses were destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses had no damage. The center, which still had its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Fortunately, most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began. Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down. Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place."

"Some 65,000 species (13,000 of which are living) have been identified."
"Ostracods are small crustaceans, typically around in size, but varying from to in the case of ""Gigantocypris""."
"Their bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a bivalve-like, chitinous or calcareous valve or ""shell"". The hinge of the two valves is in the upper (dorsal) region of the body."
"Marine ostracods live in the zooplankton. Others live in the benthos, on or in the upper layer of the sea floor."
"Many ostracods are also found in fresh water. Terrestrial species of ""Mesocypris"" are known from humid forest soils of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania. They have a wide range of diets, and the group includes carnivores, herbivores, scavengers, and filter feeders."
Copepods may not be monophyletic. Ostracod taxa are grouped into a Class based on gross morphology (what they look like). Their DNA sequence analysis in their mitochondria has been examined. The results are not clear.
Urban decay
"Urban decay is the process in which a city or area goes into conditions of disrepair or becomes decrepit or filled with blight. Urban decay involves white flight, population changes, depopulation, economic troubles, high local unemployment, higher than usual crime and political issues. Blight is associated with condemned properties, empty lots and deserted areas that often attract criminal activity. That includes squattiing in these buildings/homes,"

Muhammad Hassan
"Mark Copani (born November 7, 1981 in Syracuse, New York) is a retired American professional wrestler who is best known for wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name, Muhammad Hassan."
"His gimmick was about a Middle Eastern-American wrestler that wanted acceptance from the stereotypes created by the 9/11 attacks. His gimmick got attention from the New York Post, TV Guide, Variety and other news sources because he was supposed to face The Undertaker in a match The Great American Bash and Teddy Long put Hassan's manager, Daivari in a match with The Undertaker on the earlier version of SmackDown."
"After Daivari was defeated, Hassan began to pray on the entrance ramp and five masked men came out that were dressed in black shirts, ski-masks, and camo pants. They were armed with clubs and a piano wire and they beat and choked the Undertaker out, and Hassan put him in the Camel Clutch."
"Three days later before the episode aired, the London bombings took place and UPN didn't have enough time to edit the segment out of the episode and they showed the unedited version in the United States and Canada but was removed from airing in Australia and Europe."
"UPN urged the WWE to remove Hassan's character from television which they succeeded in when Copani was released from his WWE contract on September 21, 2005."
"The Amalie Arena is an arena in Tampa, Florida, that has been used for ice hockey, basketball, and arena football games, as well as concerts."
It is home to the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League and the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League.
The area has previously been called The Ice Palace (19996-2011) and Tampa Bay Times Forum (2012-2014).
History.
"The arena, in Downtown Tampa's Channelside District was a secondary location chosen after the failure of Tampa Coliseum Inc. to secure funding to construct an arena on Tampa Sports Authority land near Tampa Stadium. It opened in 1996 as the Ice Palace. Its first event was a performance by the Royal Hanneford Circus. The first hockey game was the Lightning hosting the New York Rangers, which the Lightning won by a score of 5–2."
"The arena was built as a new home for the Lightning after the club outgrew the older, smaller Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds. Prior to the opening of the Ice Palace, the Lightning moved to the Florida Suncoast Dome, which was nicknamed the ""Thunderdome,"" in St. Petersburg, Florida, joining the Tampa Bay Storm, in 1994. Upon the completion of the Ice Palace, both the Lightning and the Storm, moved in. The Thunderdome, now named Tropicana Field, is currently home to Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays."
Control of the venue has changed hands three times since the building's opening in 1996. The lease agreement ties the arena to the ownership of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
"Naming rights to the Ice Palace were sold to the ""St. Petersburg Times"", a daily newspaper sold throughout the Tampa Bay Area. In January 2012, the arena name changed to Tampa Bay Times Forum once the newspaper renamed itself the ""Tampa Bay Times""."
"On September 3, 2014, Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik announced that the arena would be renamed Amalie Arena after they came to an agreement with Amalie Oil Company, an oil company based in Tampa. Other entertainment events occasionally held in the Arena include concerts, NBA games, USF Basketball and NCAA Tournament games, tennis, professional wrestling, boxing, figure skating, and rodeos (as well as stand-alone bull riding events; the Arena has hosted an event by the PBR's premier tour, the Bud Light Cup (renamed Built Ford Tough Series in 2003), annually since 1998.)"
Notable events.
"The building hosted the 1999 NHL All-Star Game, World Wrestling Federation ""Survivor Series 2000"", and games of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 2003, 2008 and 2011. The Arena hosted 4 of the 7 games during the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, as the Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames 4 games to 3 to win their first Stanley Cup. The Arena also hosted ArenaBowl XII (1998) and ArenaBowl XVII (2003) and the 2007 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament."
"The Arena hosted the 2008 NCAA Women's Division I Final Four Basketball Tournament on April 6–8. Tennessee beat Stanford, 64-48. In 2009, the Arena hosted the Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Tournament."
"In 2009, Britney Spears performed at the Arena for her ""The Circus Starring Britney Spears"" tour. The show is also notable for a wardrobe malfunction and the remark, ""Okay, my pussy is hanging out of this fucking --"", after she performed ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" and didn't realize that her mic was still on. The incident later received notable attention and has received thousands of views on YouTube."
"In 2012, Amalie Arena hosted the NCAA Men's Hockey Frozen Four championship finals; this was the first time the ""Frozen Four"" was held outside the northern US since 1999, when the University of Alaska Anchorage hosted the event at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, now the Honda Center, in Anaheim, California. The Frozen Four was hosted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the nearest NCAA hockey team to Florida."
"WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown has been held at the arena numerous times. WWE held their three-hour event inside of the Arena where Raw hosted their 800th episode celebration on November 3, 2008. WWE returned to the Arena once again for the December 21st edition of Raw where former New York Yankees and current Tampa Bay Rays player Johnny Damon served as the Guest Host at the time he was a free agent. For the first time in three years, SmackDown returned to Amalie Arena for the June 8, 2010 edition."
"Tampa also hosted WWE Extreme Rules on May 1, 2011; it was the arena's first WWE PPV since Survivor Series 2000 in 11 years as it was originally scheduled to take place at the Amway Center in Orlando."
Amalie Arena hosted the 2012 Republican National Convention.
Piedmont blues
"Piedmont blues (also called East Coast Blues) is a blues music style from the East Coast of the USA. The name came from the Piedmont, a hilly coastal area between Richmond, Virginia and Atlanta, Georgia. But the style is also played in Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida."
"The main instruments are guitar, vocals, drums and bass. The Piedmont style is played on acoustic instruments. The main difference to the Delta blues is the ragtime based rhythm. The style is influenced by ragtime, country string bands, traveling medicine shows and popular song of the early 20th century. East Coast Piedmont Blues blended both black and white, rural and urban song elements in the diverse urban centers of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic region. In contrast to Delta blues, the Piedmont blues were influenced by white music."
"In the early twentieth century artists such as Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Blake, Blind Willie McTell, Rev. Gary Davis and Sonny Terry made Piedmont blues popular. Women also played the Piedmont guitar style, including Etta Baker and Elizabeth Cotten, whose “Freight Train” is one of the most recognized Piedmont tunes. Before the Second World War Piedmont blues was a style that was very popular with the African-Americans of the South. The heyday was the 1920s and 1930s."
Sportverein Austria Salzburg
The Sportverein Austria Salzburg (shortly SV Austria Salzburg) is an Austrian footballclub based in Salzburg. The club was founded in 2005 after the Red Bull takover of the old Austria Salzburg.
History.
The club was founded in September 2005 after the Red Bull takover of the 1933 founded club SV Austria Salzburg. Due to differences about the new club supporters left the now socalled FC Red Bull Salzburg and founded SV Austria Salzburg. Role models were the fanbiased English clubs AFC Wimbledon and FC United of Manchester. The club claims to preserve the tradition of SV Austria Salzburg.
"The season 2005/06 they played together with PSV Schwarz-Weiß in the Salzburger Landesliga (4th class) but at the end of the season the cooperation ended. The club has to start in the 7. class of Austrian football. The first match of the new SV Austria Salzburg was played on 29 July 2006 against ""Lieferinger SV"", another football club from the city of Salzburg. SV Austria Salzburg won 6–0.But the following seasons they won the classes they played in so they play the season 2010/11 in the Regionalliga West, which is the 3rd class of Austrian league system."
"In the 2014–15 season the club was promoted to the First League, the second tier of Austrian football. The promotion to the First League forced the club into debt of €900,000 by November 2015. It was caused by an increased budget for the players and a security requirement In November 2015 they were fined €40,000 and had 6 points deducted. This was due to their failure to adhere to the league's stadium requirements. The same year they were relegated."
Now Austria Salzburg is playing in the Regionalliga Salzburg (3rd level).

Panthera
Panthera is a genus of the family Felidae.
"It has five living species, which are the biggest cats in the Felidae. The tiger is the largest ""Panthera"" species, and the largest of all cats. The leopard is the smallest ""Panthera"" species."
"Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the ""Panthera"", a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008. The genus ""Neofelis"" is also closely related."
Superpower
"A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a great power and less powerful than a hyperpower. Right now, only the United States is a superpower. However, China may become a superpower in the future. Some say it is already one. Others say that it will not become a superpower."
"In the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs – those who would be able to start a nuclear war – were all given ""permanent"" seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union."
"For most of the 1900s, the Soviet Union was a superpower. After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, it was not a superpower anymore. Russia got most of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and also its permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries also have nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power. The Republic of India, and Pakistan are a few countries like this. In order to be a superpower, a country must dominate economic, cultural, and military as well as diplomatic influence."
Snow leopard
"The snow leopard (""Panthera uncia""), also known as the Irbis and ounce, is a feline, which lives in central Asia. It used to be thought not to be closely related to the smaller leopard, which is why they were put in different genera before. However, recent research has discovered this is not correct. The cat is closely related to the other big cats in the genus ""Panthera""."
Appearance.
"Snow leopards are about 2-5 meters long in the body, and have a 90-100 centimeter long tail. They weigh up to 75 kilograms. They have grey and white fur with dark rosettes and spots, and their tails have stripes. Its fur is very long and thick to protect it against the cold. Their feet are also big and furry, which helps them to walk on snow more easily. They use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill."
Voice.
"They are one of the cats which cannot purr: ""In five cat species (lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard and snow leopard) the epihyoideum is an elastic ligament, whereas in all other species of the Felidae the epihyal is completely ossified (bony)... those felids with an elastic epihyoid are able to roar but not purr, while species with a completely ossified hyoid are able to purr but not to roar"". Despite this, it seems now that snow leopards cannot roar, though they can make a number of other sounds."
Hunting.
"Snow leopards are well camouflaged, and are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk). They stalk and eat medium-sized prey like Ibex, bharal (mountain sheep) and wild goats. It can survive on a single sheep for two weeks."
"Snow leopards prefer to ambush prey from above, using broken terrain to conceal their approach. They try to land on the sheep, and kill it directly. If the sheep runs, they pursue it down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of their initial leap to chase prey for up to ."
"They kill with a bite to the neck, and may drag the prey to a safe location before feeding. They consume all edible parts of the carcass, and can survive on a single bharal (blue sheep) for two weeks before hunting again. Annual prey needs is 20–30 adult bharals."
Habitats.
"In summer, snow leopards usually live above the tree line on mountainous meadows and in rocky regions at altitudes from . In winter, they come down into the forests to altitudes around . Snow leopards prefer broken terrain, and can travel without difficulty in snow up to deep, although they prefer to use existing trails made by other animals."
"They live alone. After a pregnancy of about a hundred days the female gives birth to 2 or 3 cubs. Snow leopards are protected in most of the countries they live in. However, people do still kill them for their fur, or to protect their cattle."
Distribution.
"The snow leopard has a huge range in central Asia. It is in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kashmir, Kunlun, and the Himalaya to southern Siberia, Mongolia, and Tibet."
"Since many estimates are rough and outdated, its numbers could be falsely viewed as low. The total wild population of the snow leopard was estimated in 2008 as 4,510 to 7,350 individuals."
Taxonomy and evolution.
"The snow leopard was not thought closely related to the ""Panthera"" or other living big cats. However, recent molecular studies put the species firmly in the genus ""Panthera"": its closest relative is the tiger (""Panthera tigris""). MSW3 still refers to the snow leopard as ""Uncia uncia"", but the more recent IUCN classifies it as Panthera uncia."
In popular culture.
The snow leopard is an official symbol of Kazakhstan.
"On 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown."
"A local industry using the fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully reestablished in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. However, the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres and the last flax industry closed in 1965."
"In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938."
1981 to present.
"In 1981, the British governmente changed the status of Saint Helena and the other Crown colonies to ""British Dependent Territories""."
"In 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha."
"Geography, plants and animals."
"The island of Saint Helena has a total area of . The centre is covered by forest, of which some has been planted. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena Plover or Wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the islets near the coast."
"The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak () at . In 1996 it became the island's first national park. In 2000 a project began to replant part of the lost Great Wood, called the Millennium Forest, and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust, established in 2002."
"There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre of the shore."
"The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena Plover, known locally as the Wirebird. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag."
Climate.
"The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by trade winds that blow almost continuously."
Administrative divisions.
"Saint Helena is divided into eight districts. People that works and lives in the Jamestown Harbour and in the Royal Mail Ship ""St. Helena"" (RMS) are included in the census in their work places (see reference)."
Economy.
"The island had an economy of only one crop until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string. St Helena's economy is now weak, and is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government."
The tourist industry is heavily based on the presence of Napoleon in the island.
"Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports ""Tungi Spirit"", made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, ""Opuntia ficus-indica"" (""Tungi"" is the local St Helenian name for the plant). Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income."
Banking and currency.
"Saint Helena has its own currency, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling. The government of Saint Helena produces coins and banknotes. The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and in Georgetown, Ascension Island."
Helicopter
A helicopter (also often used: chopper or heli) is a kind of flying machine or aircraft. A helicopter lifts up off
"of the ground and moves because of its rotors. A rotor is several small wings, called rotor blades, that spin together around a shaft. For that reason, helicopters are sometimes called ""rotary-wing aircraft"". A helicopter flies differently from an airplane. An airplane must move forward to stay in the air, but because the helicopter's rotor blades are always moving, the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground. Not needing a runway, they can land in places where an airplane cannot. Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades, which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted."
History.
"Since around 400 BC, the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a children's toy. The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air. Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick. Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490, and drew pictures of his ideas. It was hundreds of years later (in the early 20th century) before anyone built one that could really fly. The first practical helicopters were built by Frenchman Louis Breguet in 1935 and by German Henrich Focke in 1936. A Russian immigrant, Igor Sikorsky, built and perfected the first practical helicopter in America in 1939."
Uses.
"Helicopters are especially useful when there are disasters when infrastructure is damaged. Food packets, water, medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road. When people are injured, helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road."
"Helicopters are also used by the military, because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them. Attack helicopters act as attack aircraft carrying and shooting guns and missiles."
Training helicopter is used for learning how to be a helicopter pilot.
"Taipei 101 has some of the most modern safety security of anything ever built, requiring a challenging combination of strength and flexibility, which allow it to withstand winds up to 216 km/h (134 mph), and earthquakes of a magnitude of 9.0. It has higher safer ratings than Taiwan’s nuclear power plants."
"The ""double stairstep"" design reduce the potentially dangerous oscillations caused by high winds by about 30-40%, allowing the structure to stand, even under the force of relentless typhoons. And by now, they’ve become a recognizable design element of the structure."
September 1
"This day is the first day of the last third of the year as well as the two thirds point of the common year because there are 243 days before and 121 days after it in common years. There are 244 days before and 121 after it in leap years. The exact time the second third of the year starts is 8:00 a.m. In countries that use summer time the actual exact time of the midpoint in a common year is at 9:00 a.m. for locations in the northern hemisphere, or 7:00 a.m. for locations in the southern hemisphere; this is when 243 days and 8 hours have elapsed and there are 121 days and 16 hours remaining. In a leap year in those countries, the last third of the year starts at midnight. In countries that use summer time, the second third starts at 1:00 a.m. on September, or 11:00 p.m. on August 31 in the southern hemisphere. This is due to summer time having advanced the time by one hour."
Sergio Aragonés
"Sergio Aragonés Domenech (; born September 6, 1937) is a popular cartoonist. He was born in Spain and grew up in Mexico. He is most famous for his cartoons for ""MAD Magazine"" and the comic book ""Groo the Wanderer""."
Lisa Bonet
"Lisa Bonet (born Lisa Michelle Bonet; November 16, 1967), also known as Lilakoi Moon, is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Denise Huxtable on television series, ""The Cosby Show"" and ""A Different World"". She was also married to singer Lenny Kravitz from 1987 to 1993. She is of African American and Ashkenazi Jewish (from Belarus, Moldova, Poland and Russia) descent."
Tobacco
"Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus ""Nicotiana"" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family."
History.
"Native Americans used tobacco before Europeans arrived in the Americas. The earliest know use of tobacco comes from nicotine residue from a pipe in the Southeastern United States. It is Radiocarbon dated at 1685-1530 BC. Europeans in the Americas learned to smoke and brought it back to Europe, where it became very popular. At that time tobacco was usually smoked in a pipe."
"The Europeans who moved to America started to farm tobacco so that they could sell it in Europe. This became one of the main causes of the African slave trade. In 1610 a European man called John Rolfe arrived in the American state of Virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich. Rolfe was the first non-native farmer to use ""nicotiana tabacum"", which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today. He also married Pocahontas, a Native American woman who became famous when she went to live in London."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries tobacco made farmers very rich and towns quickly grew in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1883 one third of United States tax money came from tobacco."
In 1864 the first American tobacco factory opened to produce 20 million cigarettes annually. By 1964 the cigarette contained over 500 added chemicals. Today tobacco manufacturers are still not required by law to list the 500+ ingredients.
Tobacco and health.
"Tobacco users (especially smokers) and people around them (with passive smoking) risk many very serious and often deadly illnesses, such as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and lung disease. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes tobacco use as ""the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature (early) death worldwide"". There are over 4800 chemicals in tobacco, including arsenic. Sixty-four of them are known to cause cancer. Smoking can also make men lose erections, and make their penises a bit smaller."
Jerusalem
"Jerusalem (; ; ) is one of the oldest cities in the world that people have lived in continuously. It is important to many major religions. Jews consider Jerusalem a holy city because it was their religious and political center during Biblical times and was the place where the Temple of God stood. Christians consider Jerusalem holy because many events in the life of Jesus took place there. Muslims believe that Muhammad rose to heaven from Jerusalem, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the first Qibla of Muslims after Mecca."
"Jerusalem is the capital city of both Israel and Palestine, under their laws. Most other countries disagree. Most countries have their embassies with Israel in Tel Aviv."
Jerusalem is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a hilly city with many valleys around it.
History.
"Jerusalem is a very old city. It has great importance for three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Bible says King David, the second king of Israel, took this city from pagans and settled his palace there. King Solomon, David's son and the next king, built the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Later, as capital of Judah, Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, the king of Babylon. The Palace of King David and the Temple of Solomon were burned, and the Jews were captured and taken to Babylon. Seventy years later, the Persian King Cyrus allowed them to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple."
"Later the area was occupied by Romans. King Herod the Great, who ruled for the Roman Emperor, made the Temple larger to try and win Jewish favor. The Temple was famous for its greatness and beauty."
"Jesus died in Jerusalem around 33 CE. In 70 CE, the Jews rebelled against the Romans, but the Romans destroyed the city and the Temple. Jewish people who lived in Jerusalem were caught and became slaves. The Romans renamed Jerusalem with a Latin name. Since then, the Temple has not been rebuilt, and only a part of its wall remains until today."
"After the Roman Empire was split into two, the Byzantine Empire ruled Jerusalem. Later, Muslims took over the city from them. The Muslims believed Muhammad went to heaven from Jerusalem."
"Later, the Pope in Rome sent the Crusaders from Western Europe to try and take Jerusalem back. They succeeded for a while, but eventually the city fell again to the Saracens. Until the 20th century, Jerusalem was a part of the Ottoman Empire. There were some Jews in Jerusalem all along, even though they were ruled by other people."
"The Baluchistan States Union existed between 3 October 1952 and 14 October 1955 in modern southwest Pakistan. It was formed by the states of Kalat, Kharan, Las Bela and Makran with the capital at the town of Kalat. The area of the Union was roughly the western half of the modern province of Balochistan. The Union was separate from the Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan which comprised areas to the northeast of the Union. The Union did not include the enclave of Gwadar City which was part of the Sultanate of Oman. The four state rulers continued in office but some matters became the responsibility of the Council of Rulers."
Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)
The Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan was a former province of British India. It was in the northern parts of the modern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
Interwar period
"The interwar period was a time in history from 9 November 1918 to 1 September 1939, between the two world wars, World War I and World War II."
"The period began with many changes internationally. The League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the world, but did not prevent problems with Nazi Germany, which soon left the League. Also occurred was the growing threat of Japan, which invaded China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy had begun to rise as international powers. All of that happened in the 21 years and soon triggered World War II."
Modernism
"Modernism was a cultural movement of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama."
"Modernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory."
Art.
"Modern art replaced classical art. It included abstract art, cubism, pop art, minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors."
"Typical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian."
Music.
"Composers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schoenberg are modernists. Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"" (""Le Sacre du Printemps"") is a landmark work."
Dance.
"Ballets such as ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""Les Noces"" (""The Wedding"") mark the arrival of modernism into this traditional dance form. Modern dance outside of ballet started with Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller and Ruth St. Denis."
Literature.
"James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. ""Ulysses"" (1922) has been called ""a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement"". Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" (1915), ""The Trial"" (1925) and T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Waste Land"" (1922) are also prime examples. Looking back, it is clear that: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866) had a great influence on other writers."
"The arrival of magic realism is part of modernism. The novels and short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov such as ""Diabolidad"" and ""The Master and Margarita"" are examples."
Architecture.
"Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius the founder of Bauhaus, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark ""A building is a machine for living in"" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958), became the archetypal modernist building."
Criticism.
"A criticism of the modern movement is that it does not value tradition, and goes in for change for the sake of change. What modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books."
"These experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and a love of populism and popular culture."
Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition.
Victorian era
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was a time of Queen Victoria's rule from 1837 to 1901. This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.
"The Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry."
"After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:"
SR Class 4Lav
The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.
SR Class 6Pul
"The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6Pul, 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935 (the Cor designation was later used for 4Cor units)."
British Rail Mark 3
"British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s."
Desiro
Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.
"The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort."
Austria.
"In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called ""ÖBB 5022"". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff."
Bulgaria.
"In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas."
Denmark.
"In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains."
Germany.
"Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these ""Class 642"" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs."
"The ""Class 642"" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the ""Müglitzbahn"", have made greater passenger numbers."
"At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the ""Class 642"" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the ""Class 643""."
Hungary.
"Right now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton."
Malaysia.
The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.
These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.
Romania.
"Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: """"Regio"", ""InterRegio"" and ""InterCity"" inter-city services, but mostly on its ""InterRegio"""" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes."
Russia.
"The word “free” in “free software” means ""freedom"", not ""price"". People are allowed to sell Free software, but the person who buys the software can change it, give it away or sell it too."
"The words “free software” are sometimes used in English to just mean software that can be downloaded without paying money, which is confusing. Sometimes this software lets people make their own copies for other people, however it may not let people do all the things that they can do with real Free software, such as change it or sell it. In this case “free” means “free of charge”. To make the difference more clear, software that does not cost money should be called freeware; it is almost always proprietary software."
1812
1812 was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar.
Zookeeper
"A zookeeper is a worker in a zoo, responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in scientific research, and in public education, conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public."
"Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant college degree and extensive experience."
"Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times."
Cage
"A cage is a box which is made to keep something inside of, without it being able to get out (such as an animal). Cages are usually made of many metal bars."
"A cage which has birds in it is called a ""birdcage""."
Toddler
"A toddler is a very young child who is learning how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to communicate with others."
Most children are toilet trained while they are toddlers.
"Even when toddlers can walk, they are often transported in a stroller, buggy, or pushchair when the walk is a long distance or when they're tired. Toddlerhood typically begins after age one and is over by the time the child is 4, but this can differ depending on the child."
Ronald McDonald
Ronald McDonald is an American clown character who is a mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
"He wears yellow and red stripes and has wacky hair. He lives in McDonaldland, with lots of his friends. The first actor to play Ronald McDonald was famous weatherman and Bozo the Clown actor Willard Scott. Later the actor for Coco the Clown, Michael Polakovs, redesigned Ronald McDonald's outfit and make-up, which is the version still used by today's Ronald McDonald actors. The fictional character is a heroic magical adventurer that stands up good and freedom, such as saving the rain forest and supporting Ronald McDonald House Charities."
Actors.
"McDonald's has many actors employed to portray Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in television commercials."
This is a list of these main actors:
"An actor by the name of Joe Maggard stated in an interview of The Guardian in 2014 that he portrayed the Ronald McDonald character from 1995 to 2007. However, It was stated in a 2003 article by The Baltimore Sun that Maggard was only a stand-in actor for one commercial shoot in the mid 90s and stated that ""he is definitely not Ronald McDonald"", as Jack Doepke and David Hussey were the real current portrayers as Ronald throughout the time period Joe claimed he did. In 1998, he was charged of carrying a weapon in the New Hanover County, N.C., McDonalds and the next year he was convicted in making harassing telephone calls posing as Ronald. The judge ordered him to take anger management classes."
Bob Marley
"Robert Nesta ""Bob"" Marley (February 6, 1945 - May 11, 1981) was an important Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician in the 1970s and 1980s. He made the style of reggae music very popular all over the world. His music told stories of his home and the Rastafarian religion that he followed. Some songs were about religion and some songs were about politics like Get Up Stand Up."
"Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945 in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica to a black teenager, Cedella Booker, and a white man named Norvall Marley. When he was young, his friends gave him the nickname, ""Tuff Gong"". He started his music career in the 1960s with his group the Wailing Wailers (or simply the Wailers), that he formed with two friends, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. In 1962, Bob Marley and the Wailing Wailers recorded their first two songs called ""Judge Not"" and ""One Cup of Coffee""."
"Bob married Rita Anderson in 1966 and she joined the group as a back-up singer. They had five children together. One is Ziggy Marley, who is also a well-known reggae performer."
"Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990 Prague has become one of Europe's most popular tourist places. It has buildings dating from the 13th century to the present day. The castle looks very important on the hillside. Charles Bridge is now closed to traffic so that pedestrians can walk across the bridge and buy souvenirs from the stalls. There are many museums, palaces and theatres. Tourists often go to the Old Town Square in the centre of Prague. There are lots of buildings there from different periods of history. The statue of Jan Hus stands high above the square. There is a famous Astronomical Clock on the wall of the Old Town Hall. There are museums dedicated to famous people including Smetana, Dvořák and Franz Kafka. The Estates Theatre is one of Europe’s oldest theaters. It was built in the 1780s and Mozart conducted the first performance of his opera ""Don Giovanni"" there."
Prague is on the list of World Heritage Sites.
Economics.
"Prague has been important in the economy of what is now the Czech Republic since the region developed industry in the 19th century. Textiles and machinery are made and exported to many countries. Food, electronics and chemicals are produced. Nearly half the people who work are women."
"Prague is becoming a city where many international companies have their headquarters. Since the late 1990s, Prague has become a popular filming location for international productions and Hollywood motion pictures."
There are no ghettos in Prague.
Colleges and universities.
"The city contains several universities and colleges including the oldest university in Central and Eastern Europe: the Charles University, founded in 1348."
Transport.
"Prague has three metro lines, 20 tram lines, and buses that connect to the suburbs. There is also a funicular rail link to the top of the Petřín Hill and a chairlift at Prague Zoo. All these services have a common ticketing system."
"Prague metro is one of the best in Europe for quality and speed. It has got 3 lines (A, B, and C), 65 kilometers and 61 stations."
Trains from Prague connect to major cities in neighbouring countries.
"There is a modern airport, Václav Havel airport Prague, used by many airlines including Czech Airlines."
Sport.
"Prague has many parks and gardens, including a park for culture, sports and entertainments which is named after Julius Fučík, a resistance leader of World War II. It has three stadiums, the largest of which, Spartakiádní stadion, holds 250,000 people. They have a good Soccer team and play many sports."
Wallet
"A wallet is a small flat container, mostly of leather or fabric, that a person uses to hold cash, credit cards, identification cards, etc. Most men usually keep their wallets in their pockets, while women usually keep them in larger bags called purses."
"Wallets, particularly in Europe, where larger coins are prevalent, contain also a coin purse compartments. Some wallets have built-in clasps or bands to keep them closed."
"As European banknotes, such as Euros and Pounds, are typically larger than American banknotes in size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets."
"A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, program, or service that stores public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function, a cryptocurrency wallet most often also offers provides encryption and/or the use of a digital signature. Any crypto wallet is a combination of a private key and a public address. There are the following options for crypto wallets: hardware, desktop, paper, mobile, web wallets."
Memory card
"A memory card is a form of flash memory that is used in a range of electronic devices such as a digital camera or video game console. The memory card stores data, images, music, saved games or other computer files."
"Flash memory devices like this contain no moving parts so they are not easily damaged. This means that they are ideal for use in portable devices such as MP3 players, digital cameras, mobile phones etc."
"The amount of data memory cards can store depends on the ""capacity"" of the card. Currently (in 2017) the largest memory cards can store 1 terabyte of data. As the technology improves, larger capacity cards are expected."
"There are many different types of memory cards, for example MultiMediaCard or CompactFlash, but the majority are SD cards or MicroSD."
Computer printer
"A computer printer is a piece of hardware for a computer. It allows a user to print items on paper, such as letters and pictures. Usually a printer prints under the control of a computer. Many can also work as a photocopier or with a digital camera to print directly without using a computer."
Types of printers.
"Today, the following types of printers are in regular use:"

"Stefanović died on 25 July 2022 in Belgrade, Serbia, aged 92."
Flash memory
"Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics. It is most often used in devices like digital cameras, USB flash drives, and video games. It was developed in the 1980s from the earlier and similar EEPROM."
"Flash memory is different from RAM because RAM is volatile (not permanent). When power is turned off, RAM loses all its data. Flash can keep its data intact with no power at all. A hard drive is also permanent (non-volatile) storage, but it is bulky and fragile. Flash memory is one kind of Non-volatile random-access memory. It is slower than RAM but faster than hard drives. It is often used in small electronics because of its small size and lack of moving parts."
"The main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage. Another weakness is the number of times that data can be written to it. Data can be read from flash as many times as desired, but after a certain number of ""write"" operations, ""write cycles"", it will stop working. Most flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write cycles."
"EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does: ones made in the 20th century could only survive about 100,000 write cycles, later increased to about a million. It is more expensive than flash, so it is rarely used for storage greater than 128kB. The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that most EEPROM devices can erase any byte of memory at any time. Flash memory can only erase an entire chunk, or ""sector"", of memory at a time. Both EEPROM and flash are subject to the limitation that only bytes in an 'erased' state can be written, which means that if the user wants to change only one byte of flash, the entire sector must be erased and re-written. This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM. Some flash memory can store hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes. Many are in the form of a pen drive."
"Flash memory is used in USB Drives, solid-state drives, computer RAM (occasionally), hybrid drives (small SSD + hard drive), graphics cards, and memory cards."
Bottrop
"Bottrop is a city in west central Germany, on the Rhine-Herne Canal, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Bottrop is in the Ruhr industrial area, It is next to Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center. There are factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. The population is currently 119,655. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s and was chartered as a city in 1921. In 1975 it was put together with the unification with the neighbor communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left in 1976."
History.
"The place is first heard of in 1150, as ""Borthorpe"". This name means ""village on the hillside"". In the year 1423, Bottrop is awarded the status of a market town. In 1786 the first cotton mill opens. Coal mining starts in 1856. The city gets town privileges in 1919. In 1953, the population passed 100.000 people for the first time."
Certifications and sales.
"In February 2008, RIAA reduced the certification-award-levels for Oro y De Platino to Gold=50,000 and Platinum=100,000."
Ones (album)
"Ones is a greatest hits album by Selena. The album included an unreleased ballad song. The album sold over 500,000 copies in the United States."
Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front
JKLF seeks independence of Jammu and Kashmir state from both India and Pakistan.
"The JKLF claims that they are not Islamist, but are nationalist, and opposes the emergence of the territories into either Pakistan or India but rather wants the region of Kashmir to separate from the three countries and become independent."
"In 1982 branches were established in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Pakistan and in 1987 in Indian-administered Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir)."
Mirador de la Flor
"Mirador de la Flor () is a life-sized statue that is in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue is a memorial to American singer Selena. The statue was ordered by the Mayor of Corpus Christi as a tourist attraction in 1997. Hundreds of fans visit the statue weekly from all over the world. The statue faces Corpus Christi bay, where the gun that killed Selena was thrown. A second life-sized statue of Selena was made in Mexico in March 2011."
Marie Joséphine of Savoy
"Marie Joséphine of Savoy (Maria Giuseppina Luigia; 2 September 1753 – 13 November 1810) was the wife of the future Louis XVIII of France. She was a princess of Savoy by birth, became the titular Queen consort, and was known by her title: Her Royal Highness, Countess of Provence (""comtesse de Provence"")."
Family.
"She was born at the Royal Palace of Turin on 2 September 1753 and was the third child and second daughter of Victor Amadeus and his wife the Spanish Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain. At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia."
Marriage.
"Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 ""by proxy"" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court."
"In France she was known as Marie Joséphine de Savoie. She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king. She was a cousin of the ill-fated ""Princess of Lamballe"" who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage. At the death of her husband’s grandfather Louis XV in 1774, her brother-in-law succeeded as Louis XVI. She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781, but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage. In 1791 Marie Joséphine went to Germany. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple."
"Marie Joséphine died of an edema at Hartwell House, English residence of the exiled French royal family. Marie Joséphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Her body was removed a year later on Louis's orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia; today in Cagliari Cathedral."
Islam in Palestine
"Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories, with Muslims comprising 75% of the population of the West Bank, and 99% of the population of the Gaza Strip."
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The ""Haram al Sharif"" (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah (paradise); there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran, however."
This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims are sensitive to and mindful of the circumstance that two mosques along with the rest of East Jerusalem are claimed and illegally occupied by the state of Israel.
Specific impulse
"Specific impulse (often shortened to ""I""sp) is a way to describe how well a rocket performs. It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well."
"Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like ""miles per gallon"" or ""litres per 100 kilometres"" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted."
"A rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage."
"Filming took place in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas from May to October 1996. Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene. News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico. Over 35,000 people attended, some coming from as far as Japan and South America. It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended. Producing the Astrodome scene cost about $2 million. The budget of the movie was $20 million."
"The movie's trailer was released worldwide in December 1996. Nava spent $1 million on promotions for ""Selena""."
Music.
"The soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11, 1997 by EMI Latin. The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive: ""Is It the Beat?"" and ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"". It included two medleys — ""Disco Medley"" and the ""Cumbia Medley"". They are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert. Two tribute songs were also in the album. ""Viviras Selena"" includes Tejano singers and the Barrio Boyzz. ""One More Time"", which was composed by Olmos is performed by Lil'Ray. The ""Oldies Medley"" was performed by the Vidal Brothers. The soundtrack reached at number seven on the US ""Billboard"" 200 chart and number 36 on Canada's ""RPM"". It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Selena's brother, Quintanilla III."
"Chuck Eddy of ""Entertainment Weekly"" gave the soundtrack an ""A"" rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a ""right posthumous"" album should have. Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selena's death impacted many Americans. Enrique Lopetegui of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that ""One More Time"" was a ""corny but effective"" tribute to Selena. Lopetegui commented that ""Viviras Selena"" was the ""weakest track"" of the album and that ""Is It the Beat?"" was one of the ""best songs"" of ""Selena"". He believed that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was one of the ""strongest"". Lopetegui also stated that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was similar to ""Vision of Love"" which was recorded by Mariah Carey. Lopetegui compared ""Is It the Beat?"" to the song ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" by Whitney Houston, which had similar beats and sounds. A ""Miami Herald"" writer believed the soundtrack was ""uneven"" and stated that Selena's unreleased recordings ""outshines"" the rest of the songs on the album. A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin."
Release and reception.
"Before the movie was released, Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer. Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming. The movie opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide. ""Selena"" was released on March 21, 1997, and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest debut for that week. It grossed $15,599,598 during its first week and became the number-one movie for that week. The next week, the movie grossed $24,285,142. In total, ""Selena"" grossed $35,281,794. It became the first and only movie directed by Nava to reach the 30 millionth mark. ""Selena"" was in theaters for 101 days, and Lopez's portrayal of Selena became the ""breakthrough role"" (becoming very important) for her career. She became very popular after the movie was released. ""Selena"" was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997. On September 18, 2007, Warner Bros. released a 10th anniversary of the movie. It featured unreleased ""behind the scenes"" and extras."
"The movie had mostly positive feedback from critics. Enrique Fernandez of the ""Sun Sentinel"" wrote that Nava did a great job in ""catching the audience"" with ""Selena"". Fernandez also stated that Lopez had a ""terrific characterization"" of Selena. Steve Persall of the ""St. Petersburg Times"" believed that Nava did not do a good job in retelling Selena's murder. Persall believed Nava was under pressure by Selena's family and fans to tell a more ""fairy tale"" movie then a ""real life event"". Daisann McLane of ""Sun Sentinel"" agreed that the movie was more of a ""fairy tale"" and that ""the movie is the family's version of the story"". McLane believed that ""Selena"" ""lie[d]"" about Selena's ""real life"". Stuart Elliott of ""Austin American-Statesmen"" wrote that ""Selena"" became a ""breakthrough success"" in Selena's career. Elliott believed that Nava had ""perfect[ed]"" every scene and that female Hispanics in America can relate to the conflicts and the climax of the story."
Selena ¡VIVE!
"Selena ¡VIVE! was a tribute concert that was held on April 7, 2005. It was held a week after the 10th anniversary of Selena's death. Over 65,000 fans attended the concert, which featured high-profile artists."
"""Selena ¡VIVE!"" is the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language show in American television history. The show, which lasted over three hours, scored a 35.9 Nielsen household rating."

Fifth war.
"In 1574, the fifth war began. The Catholic monarchy faced an alliance between the Protestants and a new group, known as the ""Malcontents,"" Who were were Catholic noblemen who opposed the policies of the monarchy and wanted religious toleration for the Protestants. In 1575, King Henry III's younger brother, Francis, known as the Duke of Alençon, joined the Malcontents and raised an army. Henry III gave up and in 1576 agreed to a peace treaty with the Malcontents and Protestants. Called the Peace of Beaulieu, gave a lot of land and money to the Duke of Alençon and to the Malcontents. Many of the Malcontents, including Alençon, were satisfied and became loyal to the King and the Catholics again."
Sixth war.
"In late 1576, the sixth war began. The Protestants no longer had as many allies and lost the important cities of La Charité and Issoire. However, the King did not have enough money to continue the war and defeat the Protestants totally and so the war ended in 1577."
Seventh war.
"The seventh war began in 1580 when Henry of Navarre, the most important Protestant leader, attacked the Catholic city of Cahors. He conquered the city, but the Catholics captured the Protestant city of La Mure later that year. In November 1580, another peace treaty was signed."
"In 1584, the Duke of Alençon died. King Henry III was the only living son of King Henry II (reigned from 1547 to 1559), and the next man in line to become king was the Protestant Henry of Navarre. Many Catholics wanted King Henry III to disown Henry of Navarre and to make someone else the heir to the throne because were scared of a Protestant becoming king, but Henry III refused."
Eighth war.
"In 1585, the Catholics, led by Henry of Guise, raised an army and forced King Henry III to outlaw Protestantism in France. The war that followed, the eighth war, is also known as the ""War of the Three Henrys"" and is named after King Henry III, Henry of Guise, and Henry of Navarre. Even though Henry III and Henry of Guise were on the same side in 1585, many Catholics feared that Henry III secretly wanted Henry of Navarre to be the next king. In 1588, the supporters of Henry of Guise, known as ""Leaguers,"" chased King Henry III out of Paris. In 1589, afraid that Henry of Guise wanted to take the throne from him, Henry III had him murdered, fled to the Protestant army, and joined forces with Henry of Navarre. Charles of Mayenne, Henry of Guise's brother, became the leader of the Leaguers."
"The Royal-Protestant army defeated the Leaguers at the Battle of Senlis and surrounded Paris. Before they could capture the city, King Henry III was killed by a Leaguer but named as his heir Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, before he died. The King if France was now Henry IV, who defeated Leaguer armies at the Battle of Arques (1589) and the Battle of Ivry (1590) but could not completely defeat the Leaguers. In 1593, King Henry IV converted to Catholicism."
End.
"After six more years of fighting, the Leaguers gave up, and the war ended. Henry IV pardoned those who had fought against him, and made a settlement allowing Catholics and Protestants to practice their faith within certain limits."

Streptomyces
"Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria. ""Streptomyces"" is often found in soil and is very much similar to fungi by its shape. They form long thin threads called hyphae that can differentiate into a chain of spores for reproduction. Almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by ""Streptomyces"" are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium."
Use in medicine and science.
"Streptomyces are medically important, as they produce antifungals, antiparasitic drugs, antivirals, antitumorals, anti-hypertensives, immunosuppressants and antibiotics. Different species of streptomyces are used to produce different antibiotics. Over 500 species of ""Streptomyces"" bacteria have been described. For example, widely studied ""S. griseus"" was the first to be used in production of an antibiotic streptomycin, while ""S. avermitilis"" as a source of avermictin. Another well-studied species, ""S coelicolor"", is widely used in genetic studies. Overall, Streptomyces produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin, such as tetracycline, neomycin and chloramphenicol."
Antibiotic mechanism.
"Antibiotics target essential proteins for pathogens’ growth and survival, inhibiting essential functions. For example, streptomycin, which is made from ""S. griseus,"" irreversibly binds to bacterial genetic material and causes errors in the production of new proteins, which leads to cell death. It can be used for treating severe infections, such as tuberculosis and plague. Another example is avermectin, made from ""S. avermitili."" It causes invertebrate paralysis (inability to make and pass nerve impulses), which is used as a drug and pesticide against parasitic worms and insects. Avermectin enhances glutamate (neurotransmitter) at the glutamate-gated chloride channels that mammals don’t possess. It causes the excess of chloride ions inside the cell (hyperpolarisation), so the action potential cannot be further induced, ultimately leading to paralysis."

Agustín Ross Cultural Centre
"Agustín Ross Cultural Centre (Spanish, "" Centro Cultural Agustín Ross""), previously known as Casino Ross (""Ross Casino""), is a historic casino building. It is in Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of Ross Park, in Pichilemu, Chile. The building was built in the late 1800s. In 1906 the first Chilean casino was built there. It was closed in 1932 and converted into a hotel which was open until the 1980s. The building is now Pichilemu's cultural centre."
History.
"The casino is named after Agustín Ross Edwards, a Chilean writer, member of parliament, minister and politician. He was part of the powerful family Ross Edwards, which founded the newspaper ""El Mercurio"" years earlier. Based on his european experience, Ross bought a place named ""La Posada"" (English: ""The Inn"") or Petren Fund in 1885. At that time, it was just some barracks with thick walls with a ground of 300 hectares."
"The old Ross Casino was constructed in the late 1800s by Ross himself. It contained the first mail and telegraph service and a big store. The building had three floors, and was raised using imported materials. In January 20, 1906, the first Chilean casino was opened in that building. The Ross Casino worked until 1932, when the permission was cancelled, allowing just the newly constructed Viña del Mar Casino to work. After the closing of the Ross Casino, the building was converted into a hotel was which functioned until the 1980s."
"The old casino (1905) and its gardens (1885) are an important part of the city. It was named Historic Monument by the National Monuments Council on February 25, 1988, by the supreme decree N° 100."
"Ross was also the administrator of the great Juana Ross de Edwards fortune, the Nancagua Hacienda, near the city of same name. He designed an urban set of high environmental value and landscape, transforming ""La Posada"" to a hotel (""Great Hotel Pichilemu"", later ""Hotel Ross"", or ""Ross Hotel"")."
"Ross also built several chalets, terraces, embankments, stone walls, a balcony in front of the beach and several large houses with imported building materials and furniture from France and England. Additionally, he put up a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for rich people from Santiago. He, however, could not build a dock for the city, as he had planned."
"In 1935, the Ross successors ceded to the Illustrious Municipality of Pichilemu all the Ross constructions (streets, avenues, squares, seven hectares of forests, the park in front of the hotel, the perrons and the terraces) under condition that the municipality hold them for recreation and public access."
"The Cultural Centre was severely damaged after the February 2010 Chile earthquake. The library that it hosted was completely destroyed. After the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, the Cultural Centre suffered structural damage, but Roberto Córdova, Mayor of Pichilemu, said that it was repairable."
Australia national rugby union team
"The Australia national rugby union team, nicknamed the Wallabies are the national rugby union side of Australia. The first Australian teams played against the British Lions at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 24 June 1899. The Australians won the game 13-3. In 1908, the Australians went to the United Kingdom, France and North America to play. They needed a name and someone suggested the ""Rabbits"", but the team did not like it and chose the ""Wallabies"" instead. A wallaby is a small mammal from Australia, very similar to a kangaroo. Until the 1980s, only teams playing overseas were called the Wallabies; when they played in Australia they were called Internationals. Now the national team is called the Wallabies all the time."
Sparrow
"A sparrow is a member of the genus ""Passer"". They are small passerine birds which belong to the family ""Passeridae"". They are also known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means they are one of the easiest birds to see in the wild."
"The genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, ""Passer domesticus""."
"Some authorities place other genera in the sparrow group: ""Petronia"", the rock sparrows; ""Carpospiza"", the pale rockfinch; and ""Montifringilla"", the snowfinches."
Description.
"Sparrows are small birds. They are between 11–18 centimeters long. They can weigh between 13–42 grams. They are usually brown and grey. They have short tails and small, strong beaks. Most sparrows eat seeds or small insects. Sparrows are social birds and they live in flocks (groups)."
The house sparrow.
"The house sparrow (""Passer domesticus"") is a species of sparrow. It lives all over the world. It originally lived only in Europe and Asia. However, people travelled to new places and the house sparrow went to those places too. It is now the bird with the widest distribution. This means it lives in the most places. The species has about 50 subspecies."
Distribution.
"Sparrows can be seen on every continent on earth. A long time ago, they lived only in Europe, Asia and Africa. However, people traveled to Australia, North America and South America, and now sparrows are seen there too. The house sparrow is seen in every continent. In Australia, there are no sparrows in Western Australia, as they have not been able to travel across the deserts that separate that state from the eastern states. The government employs people to hunt and destroy any sparrows that might arrive."
North America.
"The house sparrow was introduced to America in the late 19th century. It was introduced on purpose. It was imported by several people, including Eugene Schieffelin, who was a wealthy New York City admirer of Shakespeare. He wanted to introduce to America all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Two of these species were great successes: starlings and house sparrows. He organized a society for the importation of foreign birds, incorporated in Albany."
Other so-called 'sparrows'.
"Some ornithologists thought the ""Estrildid finches"" were in the same family as sparrows. However, they are now in a different family, the Estrildidae."
"There is also a group called 'American sparrows', or New World sparrows. These are also in a different family, the Emberizidae (buntings)."
"The hedge sparrow (also known as the dunnock or accentor) ""Prunella modularis"" is also not a true sparrow. It is in a different family, the Prunellidae. It is only called a sparrow because people called all small brown birds 'sparrows'. Birdwatchers call then all LBJs (little brown jobs) because they are usually so difficult to tell apart."
Tendons are often connected to joints.
Coffee substitute
"Coffee substitutes are products that try to taste like coffee. The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee, but has no caffeine in it. The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical, economic and barbaric. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, however it tasted foul. It was also hard to get. In the American Civil War there was a similar story -"
"""For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value, there is unfortunately no substitute; the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain, and cheat the palate, if we cannot deceive the nerves."" The Southern Banner, 1865"
Ingredients.
Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances.
"Some ingredients used include: almond, acorn, asparagus, barley and malt, beech nut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, cotton seed, dandelion root, fig, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel, rye, sassafras nut, sweet potato."
"Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970, and it has become a mainstream product. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides. Chicory is a native plant of Western Asia, Europe, and Northern Africa. And the cultivation of the plant is considered to be originated in Egypt. In France, around the 1800s, chicory was used as an ingredient or substitute for coffee."
"Postum is an instant type beverage used in place of coffee. It made from roasted grains and molasses. Postum history goes back to 1895 when an American named C.W. Post created the coffee substitute, inspired by a caramel coffee recipe made by Harvey Kellogg. It reached the height of its popularity during World War II. It also really caught on with people who for health or religious reasons preferred not to consume drinks that contained caffeine. For popular usage on the sitcom Seinfeld George says to Jerry he does not know why postum is not a more popular beverage."
Kuzcham Dherai
"Kuzcham Dherai (also sometimes called Dherai, Dehrai or Derai) is a town in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It is located on the bank of the river Swat and a couple of miles away from Swat Saidu Sharif airport. The population of Dherai is about 10,000 people."

Croatian language
The Croatian language is spoken mainly throughout the countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the surrounding countries of Europe.
"Croatian grammar is the grammar of the Croatian language. The Croatian language consists of three vernaculars (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian)."
"Croatian grammar books show that the codification of the language started at the beginning of the 17th century (the first grammar was written by Bartol Kašić in Latin in 1604). This means that the rules for the language were written down. From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars. Most of them described the Štokavian dialect, but some were about Kajkavian. In the 19th century, more grammars based on Štokavian were written. They were ""Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka"", written by Šime Starčević (1812), and ""Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache"", written by Ignjat Alojzije Brlić (1833). Even before the 19th century, the three dialects of the Croatian language were almost equally used. However, the way each dialect was written down varied throughout Croatia. Near the Adriatic coast, it was more similar to Italian, and near the Hungarian border, it was more similar to Hungarian."
"All grammars of the above period (1604-1836) used three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Starčević's grammar is an exception as it uses a system of four accents."
"In 19th century, Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (č,ž,š,ľ,ň,ď and ǧ). The letters that were accepted were č, ž and š, and from Polish, ć. For other phonemes (sounds), the digraphs that were accepted were ie, lj, nj and dž. Later dj or gj was changed to đ (according to proposal by Đuro Daničić)."
Orthography.
"The Croatian language uses a Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong ""ie"" or ""ije"", and ""ŕ"". This system is called ""gajica"" in Croatian (or Croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet). The name came from Ljudevit Gaj. The letter order (and whole alphabet) is called ""abeceda"" in Croatian, because the first 4 letters are spelled ""a, be, ce, de"". For writing foreign names and words, and in some professions, the Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to ""gajica"", like ""X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon)"" and others."

Grammatical cases.
"In Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. For people who are learning Croatian, declension is the most difficult part of the language to master. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension, including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension now remains. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called padeži (plural) and padež (singular)."
The question you will ask yourself here is: “Where is Krešimir going?”. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.

"Roseanna's Grave (also known as For Roseanna) is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film directed by Paul Weiland. In his review, Roger Ebert concludes that ""Roseanna's Grave"" ""isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears of the plot are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it."""

Serial-position effect
"The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon. It say that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list. They are less likely to remember the middle items. The term was created in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus. He was a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list. This ability is called free-recall. Ebbinghaus performed free-recall experiments on himself. He used a list of 2000 syllables. THe experiments showed him that the where the it was on the list affected how well he could remember it. This information is shown in the ""serial position curve"". The serial position curve shows two things. The first thing it showed him was that the first 2-3 items on the list and up to the last 8 items in a list are always remembered better than items in the middle. This was true in any list with 20 or more items. It also showed him that the size of the list and the speed at which it was preseted did not affect the outcome."
Free Recall.
"Free recall is a way of experimenting that is used in psychology. It is used to test memory. Free recall is the most common method of studying the serial position effect. to use free recakk, a person is shown a list of items. These items are normally words. The person is then asked to say which items they can remember from the list in any order. One major problem with this method is that the tests are usually done in a controlled environment. This means the result may not be different from what happens in the real world."
Primacy effect.
"The primary effect is the term used to mean that people often remember the first thing they are told. Many psychologists think that this effect may be a result of rehearsal. When a person is trying to remember the items, that person will often repeat the items to themselves. As each item is added to the list, they repeat the entire list. This causes them to repeat the first it many time. This constant repeating helps them to better remember the items at the begining of the list,The slower the list is presented, the more time a person has to repeat the list. This causes a larger primacy effect."
"In the 1970s, psychologists began testing the effect of rehearsal on the primacy effect. In 1972, psychologist Phillip Marshal tested if removing rehearsal would have an affect on the primacy effect. He did this by having the people sort the words while he was giving them a list of 18 common nouns. The people in the test were not told that their memmory was being tested. Since they did not know this, they did not repeat the words as they heard them. The experiments showed Marshal that removing the repeating also removed most of the primacy effect. It showed that rehearsal was a main cause for the primacy effect."
"In 1971, Dewey Rundus created a what he called ""overt rehearsal"" The people were told to say their thoughts out loud, This tested test ""how"" and ""when"" participants rehearsed each item in a list. In 1977, Brodie and Murdock used overt rehearsal to give an alternate explanation for the primacy effect. They learned that even as people got towards the end of the list, they were still repeating the first terms. This caused the items to still be inthe person's short-term memory (STM) near the end of the list. This created what is called a ""recency effect"". Brodie and Murdock said that rehearsal is a main cause of the primacy effect. They also believed that the primacy effect may be a type of ""recency effect""."
Recency effect.
"The recency effect is the ability to remember items near the end of a list. Unlike the primacy effect, changes in speed and the size of the list do not affect the recency effect. Psychologists have learned that asking people to list the items in the ‘order they were presented’ causes less recency effect. In a 1966 study, Glanzer and Kunitz learned that increasing the time between when the list is presented and when recall is tested can affect the recency effect. With just an added 30 second delay, there was no longer a recency effect. In 1990, researchers tried to distract the people during the test. They would have the person do something that stopped short-term memory (rehearsal). For example, they would have the person countbackward from 3. The results showed that this also removed the recency effect."

Superman
"Superman is a famous comic book character, and is often known as the first modern superhero character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in ""Action Comics"" issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes, he is also in the DC Comics. As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his nemesis general Zod as Zod was about to kill people. Like other characters in the DC Universe, there have been several alternative versions of Superman over the years. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin."
Superman's Real Life Origins.
"Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared."
Story.
"Superman was born on a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. (There is a television series called ""Smallville"" about his time growing up there)"
"As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost invulnerable (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times."
"Superman moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane."
"His weaknesses are radioactive rocks from his home planet that are called ""kryptonite""; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him."

Enemies.
"His most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro is a failed duplicate of superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman."
Teams.
"Superman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter."
Camellia
"Camellia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia. Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. Linnaeus named the genus inhonour of Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel, a Jesuit botanist. amel brought C. japonica from Manila to Spain."
"They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2–20 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3–17 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1–12 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5–9 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1–5 compartments, each containing 1–8 seeds."
"The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought."
"""Camellia"" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of butterfly species."
Cultivation and uses.
"""Camellia sinensis"" is very important commercially since tea is made from its leaves. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of ""Camellia sinensis"" or ""Camellia oleifera""."
"Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. ""Camellia japonica"" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are ""C. reticulata"", with over 400 named cultivars, and ""C. sasanqua"", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include ""C. × hiemalis"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. sasanqua"") and ""C. × williamsii"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. salouenensis""). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers."
Camellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.
"""Camellia japonica"" is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing."
Magnolia
Magnolia can mean:
Secant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_6 or formula_7.
Cotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_8 or formula_9.
"Students often use a mnemonic to remember this relationship. The ""sine"", ""cosine"", and ""tangent"" ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:"
Using trigonometry.
"With the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called ""solving"" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since ""every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles""."
"Trigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding."
"There is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation."

Monotheism
"Monotheism is the belief in only one god, rather than two or more, which would be polytheism such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt and partly Hinduism. Many religions are monotheistic, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha'i Faith, Sikhism, Eckankar, Zoroastrianism, Cao Dai and Tenrikyo. Some pagan and neo-pagan religions are also monotheistic. Deism is the belief that a higher being like god exists, but rejects the belief in many gods, revelation, religions, rituals, sacred books (like the Bible or Quran), prophets (like Jesus or Muhammad), etc. Judaism and Zoroastrianism are thought to be the oldest living monotheistic religions."
Polytheism
Polytheism means believing in many gods. A person that believes in polytheism is called a polytheist. A religion with polytheism can be called a polytheistic religion.
"Polytheism is well documented in historical religions of classical antiquity, especially those of ancient Greeks and Romans. Other ancient people who were polytheists include German pagans, Turkic peoples, Ancient Egyptians, the Celts and the Norse."
"There are various polytheistic religions practiced today. Examples include Sanamahism (Meitei paganism), Tengrism, Shinto, Chinese folk religion, Thelma, Wicca, Druidism, Taoism, Asatru and Candomblé."
"Usually, a polytheistic religion has a set of stories about the gods. This is called mythology."
"The opposite of polytheism is monotheism, which is the belief in only one god, practiced by the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, etc."
Nelvana
"Nelvana is a Canadian animation studio. It was founded in 1971 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada by Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith. The company is now owned by Corus Entertainment. It is named after a local comic book superheroine of the 1940s."
It specialises mainly in the field of child-friendly TV shows and movies. Some of them are:
Jeb Bush
"John Ellis ""Jeb"" Bush (born February 11, 1953) is an American businessman and politician. He served as the 43rd Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007."
"Bush is the second son of former President George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, and grandson of the late Prescott Bush, United States Senator from Connecticut. Following his father's successful run for Vice President in 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in real estate development. In 1986, Bush was named Florida's Secretary of Commerce, a position he held until his resignation in 1988 to help his father's successful campaign for the Presidency."
"Megan Mullally revealed that she was originally doing a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show ""Will &amp; Grace"" was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed."
"The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October 2002."
"Finding Nemo shares many plot elements with ""Pierrot the Clownfish"", a children's book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo."
"To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable the animators essentially took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist."
Box office.
"""Finding Nemo"" earned $380,673,009 in North America, and $540,900,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $921,573,009. It is the second highest-grossing film of 2003, behind '. In North America, outside North America, and worldwide, it was the highest-grossing film, up until 2020 when ' surpassed it."
"""Finding Nemo"" set an opening-weekend record for an animated feature, making $70,251,710 (first surpassed by ""Sausage Party""). It became the highest-grossing animated film in North America ($339.7 million), outside North America ($528.2 million) and worldwide ($867.9 million), in all three occasions outgrossing ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"". In North America, it was surpassed by both ""Sausage Party"" in 2016, and ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge On the Run"" in 2020. After the re-release of ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" in 2016, it stands as the fourth highest-grossing animated film in these regions. Outside North America, it was surpassed by ""Sausage Party"", ""The Tigger Movie"", and """". Worldwide, it now ranks third among animated films."
"The film had impressive box office runs in many international markets. In Japan, its highest-grossing market after North America, it grossed $102.4 million becoming the highest-grossing Western animated film until it was out-grossed by ""The Tigger Movie"" ($126.7 million). Following in biggest grosses are the UK, Ireland and Malta, where it grossed £37.2 million ($67.1 million), France and the Maghreb region ($64.8 million), Germany ($53.9 million), and Spain ($29.5 million)."
3D re-release.
"After the success of the 3D re-release of ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", Disney and Pixar re-released ""Finding Nemo"" in 3D on September 14, 2012, with a conversion cost estimated below $5 million. For the opening weekend of its 3D re-release in North America, ""Finding Nemo"" grossed $16.7 million, debuting at the No. 2 spot behind """". From seven foreign markets, it earned a total of $5.1 million."
Accolades.
"Finding Nemo won the Academy Award and Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. It also won the award for best Animated Film at the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards, the National Board of Review Awards, the Online Film Critics Society Awards, and the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards."
"The film received many awards, including:"
"""Finding Nemo"" was also nominated for:"
"In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its ""Ten top Ten"", the best ten films in ten ""classic"" American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. ""Finding Nemo"" was acknowledged as the 10th best film in the animation genre. It was the most recently released film among all ten lists, and one of only three movies made after the year 2000, the others being """" and ""Shrek""."
Video game.
"A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for PC, Xbox, PS2, GameCube and GBA."
Sequel.
"In 2005, after disagreements between Disney's Michael Eisner and Pixar's Steve Jobs over the distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced that they would be creating a new animation studio, Circle 7 Animation, to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995 and 2011). The studio had put ""Toy Story 4"" and ""Monsters at Work"" in development, and had also hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a draft for ""Finding Nemo 2"". Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after Robert Iger replaced Eisner as CEO of Disney and arranged the acquisition of Pixar."
"In July 2012, it was reported that Andrew Stanton is developing a sequel to ""Finding Nemo"", with Victoria Strouse writing the script and a schedule to be released in 2016. However, the same day the news of a potential sequel broke, director Andrew Stanton posted a message on his personal Twitter calling into question the accuracy of these reports. The message said, ""Didn't you all really learn from ""Toy Story 4""? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling"" According to the report by Hollywood Reporter published in August 2012, Ellen DeGeneres is in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory. In September 2012, it was confirmed by Stanton saying: ""What was immediately on the list was writing a second ""Carter"" movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to ""Carter"" not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit."""
Fibonacci
"Fibonacci, also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo Fibonacci and Leonardo of Pisa, lived c. 11701250. He was an Italian mathematician. He was thought ""the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages""."
"Fibonacci popularized the Hindu–Arabic numeral system to the Western World. He did this in his composition in 1202 of ""Liber Abaci"" (""Book of Calculation""). He also introduced to Europe the sequence of Fibonacci numbers which he used as an example in ""Liber Abaci""."
Fibonacci number sequence.
"Fibonacci is best known for the list of numbers called the Fibonacci Sequence. The list never stops, but it starts this way:"
"1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,"
"377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584..."
"In this list, a person can find the next number by adding the last two numbers together."
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
Digital camera
"A digital camera is a camera that stores pictures in electronic memory instead of film. Because of this, a digital camera can hold many more pictures than a traditional film camera. A digital camera can sometimes hold hundreds or thousands of pictures. Many use a memory card to store them. Most digital cameras can use a USB cable that connects into a computer to send pictures that are in the camera to the computer."
"Digital photography is a kind of photography where a digital camera is used to take photos. Digital cameras use an image sensor instead of photographic film. Very often, they also use a memory card to store the photos in a digital format. Most photography is digital, though some photographers still use the old film cameras."
"The majority of cameras are part of a mobile phone, called a ""camera phone"". They can send their pictures to other phones and other devices. Most camera phones do not make as good pictures as larger separate cameras do, especially where light is not bright."
Most digital cameras can serve as Video cameras. Some have a direct link to another computer where the data may be stored.
Data storage.
"When you take a picture or a video, it is saved on a memory device. The memory device can be internal - flash memory inside the camera, or external - memory cards, microdrives and so on. The most used method for saving pictures and videos from a camera is a SD card."
"The picture can be saved in a compressed file (JPEG, TIFF) or in an uncompressed, proprietary RAW file. The compressed picture is lower quality but the RAW picture has to be processed with a special computer program."
"A video is usually saved as an AVI, MPEG or MOV file format (it depends on the producer of the camera)."
"Most modern cameras also put Exif information in the picture file. This metadata information usually includes the date of taking the picture, the camera type, and its settings. Some cameras include GPS coordinates."
Cheers
"Cheers is a long-running American sitcom made by Charles-Burrows-Charles Productions in association with Paramount Television for NBC. The show premiered on September 30, 1982 and had its widely watched series finale on May 20, 1993, followed by a long and ongoing run in syndication. In eleven seasons, there were 270 episodes."
Setting.
"""Cheers"" was set in a Boston bar. This bar was where a group of friends would come to sit, drink alcohol, complain, and make practical jokes on a rival bar in town."
"The show's main theme in its early seasons was the romance between Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) and ex-baseball pitcher and bar owner Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Long's departure from the show in 1987 shifted the emphasis to Sam's relationship with a new character, Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley). Diane returned for the finale."
"The show also created the character Frasier Crane. Frasier got his own show (""Frasier"") the season after ""Cheers"" ended. Frasier's love interest Lilith Sternin appeared on both shows but Frasier and Lilith were no longer married in ""Frasier""."
"The producers, not wanting the show to be construed as promoting drinking, had Sam's character written as an ex-alcoholic. Most of the early episodes took place entirely within the confines of the bar. When the series became popular, some scenes were outside the bar."
"The outer shots of the bar were actually the Bull and Finch pub, north of Boston Common, which has become a tourist attraction because of its association with the series. It is said to be the bar that the series creators saw and wanted to model the bar in their show after. It has now been renamed Cheers on Beacon Hill, though its interior is quite different from the TV bar."
Ratings.
It was nearly cancelled during its first season (in which it ranked dead last among 63 shows). But it eventually became one of the most popular shows on TV because it had a top-ten rating during seven of its eleven seasons. The show earned 26 Emmy Awards out of a total of 111 nominations.
Jackie Chan Adventures
"Jackie Chan Adventures is an animated television series. Episodes were first broadcast on the WB television network, and later syndicated on other networks such as the Cartoon Network. It features fictionalized Jackie Chan and his niece Jade on their adventures trying to stop evil."
Stapler
"A stapler is an office tool that is used to place thin items such as paper together. It uses a small piece of wire (a staple) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the paper. There is also a chain of stores called ""Staples"", which sell office supplies."
"When you press the stapler down, it will release a staple. The staple is pressed into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together."
Pixar
"Pixar Animation Studios, or simply Pixar, is an American computer animation studio. It is known for its advanced CGI productions. It has been a partner of Disney for many years. In 2006, Disney bought the company."
Nevzat Tarhan
"Kaşif Nevzat Tarhan (born on July 7, 1952 in Merzifon, Amasya, Turkey ) is a Turkish medical scientist, psychiatrist and neuropsychology expert."
Life.
He was born in Merzifon in 1952. He finished Kuleli Military High School in 1969 and graduated from Cerrahpaşa Medical School Istanbul University in 1975. Following his internship at GATA (Gülhane Military Medical Academy) he worked in Cyprus and Bursa garrisons at different military medical institutions.
"In 1982 he became a specialist psychiatrist at GATA. After his clinical services as a specialist at Erzincan and Çorlu Hospitals, he became an assistant professor(1988), an associate professor (1990) at GATA Haydarpaşa. He was promoted to colonel in 1993 and became a professor in 1996."
"Between 1996 – 1999 he worked at Yüzüncü Yıl University as faculty member and as an expert at Forensic Institution. He got retired on his own will. He took the representation of ""Memory Center of America"" in Turkey in 1998."
"He has been the chairman of the board of NPİSTANBUL, the first neuropsychiatry hospital of Turkey, and also the founding rector of Üsküdar University."
He has more than a hundred publications 31 of which are international. He speaks English and German. He is married and has two children.
Romantic orientation
"Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the sex or gender that a person is most likely to have a romantic relationship with. It is compared to the term ""sexual orientation"". Romantic orientation is based on the idea that sexual attraction is one component of a larger picture. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation, as some are not aromantic."
Carbon sequestration
"Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the atmosphere. One method of sequestration is by capturing CO2 produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere. When the CO2 gas is in long-term storage, that means it has been sequestered."
Carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from Earth's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also used to prevent future human caused climate change.
Methods.
There are two long-term ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere:

"Certain IP addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network. Since they are not unique, they are not routed on the internet. The addresses which can be freely assigned are called private IP addresses, and the ones which are unique are called public. To be routed, a private address needs to be translated into a public one. This process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation, or NAT. Routers and firewalls often also perform this task."
Reaching one or more devices.
There are three different types of addresses:
Obtaining a new IP address.
"There are different ways of getting a new IP address. One of them is called Bootstrap Protocol (usually shortened to BOOTP). The device that needs a new address, does not know what network it is in, so it uses an IP address of all zeroes (0.0.0.0) which it sends as a broadcast to the current network, on a special port. In addition, it sends the MAC address of the network card, plus a 4 byte random number. The BOOTP server will send a reply, also as broadcast, addressed to a different port. The reply will contain the mac address of the client, the random number, and the IP address of the client. When the client receives the data, it will set the address specified. If the BOOTP server is configured that way, it will also send the IP address and hostname of the BOOTP Server, the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client (using TFTP) or the name of a directory, which the client should mount using NFS."
"DHCP extends BOOTP, and allows to send more information, such as the address of a time server, or information which is useful for routing."
"IP addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static. Static addressing means the same machine will always get the same IP address. With dynamic addresses, a device will get the next address which is not used. Dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time. If they are not renewed, they can be used for other devices."
IP Version 4.
"With IPv4, each address consists of four 8-digit binary numbers, called octets. An IPv4 address is 32 bits in total. The biggest number one can make with 8 regular digits is 99,999,999, but the biggest number one can make with 8 binary digits is 255 (11111111 in binary), so each octet can be any number from 0 to 255."
An IPv4 address could look something like this:
Each octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period.
"There are also special meanings associated with two different ending numbers. In general, a last number of 0 stands for the network (called ""base address""), and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network (called ""broadcast address""). Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers. A computer can be on more than one network. It can also have several names."
Public/Private addresses.
"The problem with IPv4 is that it only allows for 4.3 billion addresses, and we've almost used them all. To delay this, Network Address Translation (NAT) was created. Network Address Translation has a network share one ""public"" IP address and give every computer on the network a ""private"" IP address. Everyone living in the same house uses the same address, but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house."
Special IP addresses.
"There are some IP addresses that are reserved for special purposes. For example, the address ""127.0.0.1"" is called the Loopback Address and will ""loop back"" any packets sent to this address back to the computer that sent them, like sending mail to yourself. Although this may not seem useful, it is used to test servers."
Network.
It identifies the class of a network.
Host Part.
It identifies the host on a network.
Static IP Address.
It is a permanent internet address. It has to be configured manually. It is used in smaller networks. All servers use static IP addresses. It is a simple way for communication.
Dynamic IP Address.
It is a temporary internet address. It is assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server from a specific range of IP address.
IPv4 subnetting.
"To make a network work faster, it is split up into subnets. To do this, an IP address contains a ""network"" ID, ""subnet"" ID, and a ""host"" ID. A special binary number called a Subnet Mask is used to determine the size of the network, subnet, and host IDs."
"The original IPv4 only supported 254 networks, so in 1981 the Internet addressing specification was changed to a classful network architecture. Classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual networks. The first three bits of an IP address determined its ""class"". Three classes (""A"", ""B"", and ""C"") were defined for normal computer communication (Unicast). The size of the network ID was based on the class of the IP address. Each class used more octets for the network ID, making the host ID smaller and reducing the number of possible hosts."
"Classful networks have been replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) since 1993. CIDR also provides a network address and host address. CIDR does not have classes, which means network and host address sizes don't have to be in octets."
"An IPv4 Address in CIDR notation looks like192.168.0.14/24The slash and number represent the amount of bits that the network id uses, in this case 24 or 3 octets."
IP Version 6.
"Because IPv4 is only 32 bits, the number of available addresses will run out. To prevent this, an organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created IP Version 6 (IPv6), which will eventually finish replacing IPv4."
"IP Version 6 uses 8 octets each 16 bits = 128 bits in total. Octets in IPv6 are written in hexadecimal, and separated by colons (:). An IPv6 address might look like this:"
Is Anybody Out There
"""Is Anybody Out There"" is a song recorded by American pop group ""Maroon 5"". The song was recorded in Europe at Coca Cola Music Studios on March 21, 2011. The song set a world record for being the first song in music history to be written, produced, and recorded within a 24-hours."
Walter Horton
"Walter Horton (April 6, 1917 – December 8, 1981) was an American blues harp player. He is also known as Big Walter Horton or ""Shakey"" Horton."
Life.
"He was born in Horn Lake, Mississippi and started playing harp at the age of five. In his teens he went to Memphis and lived with little income and a lot of discrimination. In the 1930s he played with many musicians across the Mississippi delta region."
"He made his first recording in Memphis with the guitarist Little Buddy Doyle. Due to poor health he worked outside the music industry in the 1940s. In the early 1950s he was one of the first musicians recording for Sam Phillips at Sun Records in Memphis, who would later record Elvis Presley. At this time he also was part of the Chicago blues scene, where he recorded amongst others with Eddie Taylor and Johnny Shines. After Junior Wells left the Muddy Waters Band he recorded one session with Waters. In the 1960s he recorded often as sideman for other musicians. He played frequently in the 1970s at blues and folk music festivals in the U.S. and Europe, often with Willie Dixon's Chicago Blues All-Stars. In 1977 he joined Johnny Winter and Muddy Waters on Winter's album I'm Ready. At that time he also recorded for Blind Pig Records. Horton appeared in the Maxwell Street scene in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. His final recordings were made in 1980."
"He got his nickname ""Shakey"" because while playing he moved his head. He did his own first recording not until 1964 because he was a humble and shy person who did not like to be a leader. He felt more comfortable as sideman for others. Big Walter Horton died from heart failure in Chicago in 1981 aged 64."

Superbad was released on August 17, 2007 in North America. The movie received positive reviews with a 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 76 out of 100 from Metacritic."
Basseterre
"Basseterre , is the capital city of the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis, also called St Kitts and Nevis, in the West Indies. ""Basseterre"" port is at , on the south western coast of Saint Kitts Island. It is one of the chief commercial depots of the Leeward Islands. The city is in the parish of Saint George Basseterre and the southern part of the parish of Saint Peter Basseterre. In 2000 about 15,500 people lived in the city."
Basseterre is one of the oldest towns in the Eastern Caribbean.
History.
"Basseterre was founded in 1627 by the French, under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. It was the capital of the French colony of Saint-Christophe. The colony was the most northern and most southern parts of the island of St. Kitts. The middle part was held by Britain. When Phillipe de Longviliers de Poincy was made the French governor of St. Kitts in 1639, the town turned into a large, successful port, commanding Eastern Caribbean trade and colonisation. De Poincy then quickly made Basseterre capital of the entire French West Indies colony, which included the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. It was the capital until his death in 1660. The city was made capital of the entire island of St. Kitts in 1727. This is when the French were pushed off the island and the British took full control."
"The city of Basseterre has one of the most tragic histories of any Caribbean capital, destroyed many times by colonial wars, fire, earthquakes, floods, riots and hurricanes. Despite all of this, a large number of well-restored buildings still exist in downtown Basseterre."

"The city of Basseterre is on a bay on the southwestern shore of St. Kitts, Basseterre Bay. The city is in the large Basseterre Valley, almost completely surrounded by lush green hills and mountains. It is mostly low-lying, which is one explanation for the name which the French gave it, Basseterre . However, the name Basseterre is also due to the fact that the island is on the lee of winds of the island, and is thus a safe anchorage. The name Capesterre, given to the region to the North, was dubbed so as it was facing the wind. Basseterre is surrounded by the Olivees Mountains to the north and the Conaree-Morne peaks to the east. The city is drained by the College River and the Westbourne River, which are locally known as ""ghauts"" and are dry most of the year. They even form streets in downtown Basseterre. This engineering folly has proven quite disastrous though, as College River has been the scene of many disastrous in Basseterre history. Port Zante, in the centre of the bay, is on of land reclaimed from the sea in 1995."
Climate.
"Under the Köppen climate classification, Basseterre features a tropical rainforest climate. Temperatures remain constant throughout the course of the year, 27 °C year-round. Basseterre has no dry season; all 12 months on average sees more than of precipitation. On average, of rain falls on the city annually."
Around town.
"Basseterre is a very small town which is laid out in a grid pattern. It has four main streets running east-west: Bay Road, Liverpool Row, Central Street and Cayon Street. The main street running north to south is Fort Street/Bank Street, which is home to the bulk of the island's main shops and banks. The city has 2 centres, at The Circus, which is geared towards tourism purposes, and the Independence Square, which contains the cathedral, courthouse and most of the older buildings."
"Basseterre is the main commercial and industrial centre of St. Kitts. It is also the country's main port of entry, for both sea and air travel, as well as the road and rail transport hub. It houses the administration buildings for the federal government (those for the island of Nevis are in Charlestown). It also houses the headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, as well as the headquarters for many other regional financial institutions."
"Despite its small size, Basseterre played host to Carifesta VII (the Caribbean Festival of Arts) in 2000, outbidding rivals many times its size. The city was able to outbid the United States of America, to host matches for the 2007 World Cricket Cup. The Warner Park Sporting Complex was the site of the allocated first round matches of the tournament. This made St. Kitts and Nevis the smallest country in the world ever to host a World Cup event."
"Basseterre and its environs are home to many small, American-owned medical schools such as Windsor University, and also two prestigious medical institutions founded by Robert Ross: the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and the International University of Nursing. The city has four secondary schools, two of which are government owned, and two are private schools."
"Stauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under ""Jack Stauber's Micropop""."
Early life.
"Stauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating ""Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven’t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible."""
Work.
"""Buttercup"" and ""Oh Klahoma""."
"Stauber's most famous work, ""Buttercup"", is the first song released on his 2017 album ""Pop Food"". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as ""bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals."" YouTuber ""lisuga"" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, ""Kick-Heart"". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021."
"""Oh Klahoma"", the second track from ""Pop Food"", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes."
Style.
"Stauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of ""Pittsburgh City Paper"" highlighted Stauber's knack of ""pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music"" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of ""PennState CommMedia"" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson."
Animations.
"Along with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: ""surreal"", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, ""colorful"", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and ""Stauber faces"", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos."
"To make his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape."
Discography.
Albums.
Stauber has four albums on both his Bandcamp and Spotify. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to put copyright on his music.
Jack Stauber's Micropop.
"Stauber also publishes under the name ""Jack Stauber's Micropop"", releasing longer versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These songs are less popular than his songs and albums released under his main name, Jack Stauber. These extended versions are often released early for Stauber's Patreon supporters. Under the Micropop name, Stauber has released six EPs and one compilation album, along with two soundtracks for his works with Adult Swim."

"The National Assembly is a type of legislature in some countries. The best known National Assembly, and the first legislature to be known by this title, was established during the French Revolution in 1789, known as the ""Assemblée Nationale"". Almost every country in Africa has a National Assembly. However, outside of Africa there are not that many countries with National assembly. In Europe there is Britain, France, Germany etc. In Asia there is China, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan,Bangladesh etc."
Kenneth Clarke
"Kenneth Harry Clarke, Baron Clarke of Nottingham, (born 2 July 1940), often known as Ken Clarke, is a British politician. He was the Justice Secretary in the coalition government. Clarke has had a long career in politics and has served in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. On February 26, 2017, Clarke became Father of the House after the death of Gerald Kaufman."
Early life and politics.
"Clarke was born in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England and was educated at the University of Cambridge. He became the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe at the 1970 general election and became a Queen's Counsel in 1980. He held a number of lower positions in government under Margaret Thatcher until she promoted him to Health Secretary in 1988. He became Education Secretary in 1990 and when Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced with John Major he stayed on as Health Secretary until 1992 when he was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. He stayed as Chancellor until 1997 when the Conservatives were defeated in the General Election."
In opposition.
John Major resigned as leader of the Conservative Party soon after he was defeated in the general election and Clarke stood for election to replace him as leader and therefore become the Leader of the Opposition. However he was defeated by William Hague in this contest. When Hague himself resigned after losing the 2001 General Election Clarke again stood for leader but was defeated by Iain Duncan Smith. In 2005 he stood for the leadership for a third time but was defeated by David Cameron. It is thought that Clarke was unable to become leader because many in the Conservative Party do not wish to see the United Kingdom replace the pound with the Euro as the main currency whereas Clarke has always been very much in favour of this policy.
As Shadow Business Secretary.
Clarke returned to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as the Shadow Business Secretary where he has the job of monitoring the performance of the current Business Secretary Peter Mandelson. When the coalition government was formed on 11 May 2010 Clarke was made the Justice Secretary.
Swansea City A.F.C.
"Swansea City AFC are a Welsh football (soccer) team who have played in the English Premier League since 2011. Before being promoted to the Premier League for the 2011–12 season, they had played in the English Football League since 1920. They were founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and played at the Vetch Field ground until 2005 when they moved to the Liberty Stadium. Their most successful period as a team was in the early 1980s under their manager John Toshack when they played in the old First Division from 1981-1983 (which was the highest tier of English football at the time). Swansea play their home games in an all white strip. Their main rivals are Cardiff City and a match between the two sides is known as the South Wales derby. As well as competing in the English League they have also won the Welsh Cup ten times and the Football Association of Wales Premier Cup twice. In 2011, they were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Football League Championship play-offs after finishing third in the league. They avoided relegation in their first Premier League season ending up in 11th place."
Hartlepool United F.C.
Hartlepool Utd F.C are an English football team playing in the English Football League. They were founded in 1908 as ‘Hartlepools Utd’ and currently play at the Victoria ground. The well known football manager Brian Clough started his career as a manager with Hartlepool in 1965 before leaving to go on and manage Derby County.
Tippi Hedren
"Tippi Hedren (born Nathalie Kay Hedren, January 19, 1930) is an American actress. Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants. Her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian. She is best known for her performances in two movies directed by Alfred Hitchcock: ""The Birds"" and ""Marnie"". She is the mother of actress Melanie Griffith and has acted in movies with her daughter."
Japanese morning glory
"Japanese morning glory, also called the ""Ipomoea nil"", is an attractive cultivated plant, a climbing annual commonly with white edges, also named white-edge morning glory. It is found in US Florida to South America, also in Galapagos Islands."
Pyrrhic victory
A Pyrrhic victory is battle won at too great a cost.
It is one in which the side that won the victory suffers very badly. A Pyrrhic victory may take place when the victorious army has lost a huge number of men or when the enemy army has reinforcements about to arrive which greatly outnumber the winning army and mean that the chances of a second victory are very low. A Pyrrhic victory is named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus. He won a battle against the Romans in 280 BC but many of his men and most of his friends and top commanders died in the battle.
Iain Duncan Smith
"Sir George Iain Duncan Smith (born 9 April 1954 in Edinburgh, Scotland) is a British politician who is the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2016 - 2016. He was the leader of the Conservative Party from September 2001 to November 2003 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green."
"Iain Duncan Smith served in the Scottish part of the British Army, the Scots' Guard from 1975 to 1981. He became a Conservative Party MP at the 1992 General Election for the constituency of Chingford (called Chingford and Woodford Green from 1997). He became a member of William Hague's shadow cabinet in 1997 and became Shadow Defence Secretary in 1999. When Hague resigned in 2001, Iain Duncan Smith was elected leader of the Conservative Party, defeating Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo. In November 2003, Conservative Party MPs passed a Vote of No Confidence in Iain Duncan Smith because they believed he could not win the general election. He was replaced by Michael Howard. After the 2010 General Election, Iain Duncan Smith was made the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He resigned in March 2016."
Iain Duncan Smith was the first leader of the Conservative Party to have been Roman Catholic and was the first to have been born in Scotland since Arthur Balfour.
Katsuyama Castle Museum
"Katsuyama Castle Museum (勝山城博物館, ""Katsuyama-jō Hakubutsukan"") is a museum that is in the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture in Japan. The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a castle because it does not have a ""tenshu"" or ""tenshukaku""–a “keep tower” (tower to defend from enemies). It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle."
History behind the construction.
"During the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a ""tenshu"". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of Sōgōtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a ""tenshu"". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--""Echizen Daibutsu"", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen."
Modern times.
"Since the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation (""多田清文化教育記念財団"", ""Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Kyōiku Kinen Zaidan""). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government."
"In addition to Kiyoshi Tada’s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum."
"Many events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus."
"In 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the ""Echizen Daibutsu""."
You can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor.
We can get to the museum for about 15 minutes from Katsuyama station by bus. This museum closed on Wednesday and open from 9:30 to 16:30 except Wednesday.
Sylvirana mortenseni
"The Koh Chang Island frog or Mortensen's frog (""Sylvirana mortenseni"") is a frog from Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. Scientists have seen it as high as 800 meters above sea level."
Rabeya Khatun
"Rabeya Khatun (27 December 1935 – 3 January 2021) was a Bangladeshi novelist. As of 2008, she wrote over 50 novels and more than 400 short stories. Her works include essays, novels, research, short stories, religious history and travelogues. She was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1973, Ekushey Padak in 1993 and Independence Day Award in 2017 by the Government of Bangladesh."
"Khatun died 3 January 2021 at her residence in Gulshan, Dhaka."
Lyft
"Lyft is a taxi service which is publicly traded and based in San Francisco, California, USA. Lyft allows users to find, through a website or mobile app, drivers who are partnering with the service and are ready to give them a ride for a reasonable fee. Lyft's motto is “your friend with a car”. According to the company, their service allows its clients to travel by Lyft at a cost 30% lower than using traditional taxis."
The service operates in 644 cities in the United States and 12 cities in Canada.
Lyft started in the summer of 2012.
Ucanha
"Ucanha is a place in northern Yucatán, Mexico, where scientists dig up Mayan ruins. It used to be a town where Mayans lived. People lived in Ucanha during the Late Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C. — ca. A.D. 250). It was about 2.2 square kilometers in size. There were about 400 households. It was connected to a larger town, Uci, by a wide stone causeway. Uci is 13 km to the west of Ucanha."
"A large brightly colored stucco mask was discovered in Ucanha in 2017. It is about two meters tall and was found in a building near the center of Ucanha. Although masks like this one have been found in other Maya sites, this is the only one known for this part of Mexico."
The mask has been repaired so it looks the way it did when it was new. The archaeologists buried the mask again to preserve it and because the site is not legally protected.
Insemination
"For organisms that reproduce sexually, insemination is the transfer of male gametes (usually sperm) into the female reproductive tract, for the purpose of generating offspring. In mammals, this is the uterus, in birds, this is the oviduct. Insemination happens naturally during sexual intercourse, or copulation. It can also be done artificially, in which case it is called artificial insemination."
"Historically, heavy foods were eaten because most work was manual. Before the industrial revolution, men and women doing hard work needed more calories per day than they need today. At any rate this applies to countries which are highly mechanized. Porridge is a good example of the heavy calorie-laden food which has gradually gone out of favor."
Fresnel lens
"A Fresnel lens is an optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced /freɪˈnɛl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel, Buffon and Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses."
"The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away."
Giacomo Meyerbeer
"Giacomo Meyerbeer (born near Berlin, 5 September 1791; died Paris, 2 May 1864) was a famous German-born opera composer. He was the most important composer of French Grand opera during the 1830s and 1840s. Although he was tremendously popular in his day, his music is not often played now."
Life.
Early years.
"Meyerbeer was born into a rich Jewish family in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin. His father owned large sugar refineries in Berlin and in Italy. His mother also came from a rich family. Her father had been important in Germany’s struggle to be free of the French in 1812 when Napoleon was trying to conquer much of Europe. Giacomo’s mother did a lot of good work trying to help people who were wounded during the Napoleonic wars."
"Many famous people came to the house where Giacomo’s family lived. Some of the visitors were from the royal Prussian court, including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. The naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt also visited them quite often."
"The first piano teacher the boy had was Franz Lauska, who also taught the royal princes. He also had lessons in composition. Meyerbeer first played in public in 1801 playing Mozart's Piano Concerto in D Minor in Berlin. He wrote his first opera in 1810. In the same year he went to Darmstadt to study with the well-known music theorist Abbé Vogler. There he met the young Carl Maria von Weber who was also a pupil of Vogler. He left Vogler in 1811 and tried to get some work in Munich. In 1813 he found he had been offered a job as court composer to the Grand Duke of Hessen. Vogler had probably recommended him for the job. At this time Meyerbeer was better known as a pianist than as a composer. He travelled to London to hear an important pianist based there, namely J.B.Cramer. There he met other famous pianists such as Kalkbrenner and Ferdinand Ries."
Italy.
"In 1816 Meyerbeer went to Italy. He wanted to learn about Italian opera and collect Italian folksongs. While he intended at first to stay only three months, he stayed most of the next nine years. He made some trips back to Germany and Austria during this time. He composed several operas which became very popular. People started to compare him with the famous Rossini. However, in Germany people were not interested in his music. He took his opera ""Il crociato in Egitto"" to London and then to Paris, where it was a success. The opera is remembered now for being the last opera ever to have a part for a castrato singer."
"He was becoming well-known now. Spontini asked him to compose an opera for Berlin. He became friends, in Paris, with the librettist Eugène Scribe who had a lot of influence in the French theatre."
The Grand Operas.
"From 1825 onwards Meyerbeer spent his life travelling about Europe. He was often in Paris and in Berlin, but did not live in either of these places. He stayed in hotels or private houses wherever he went. One reason why he travelled was because of his health. His wife also had bad health, so they often went to spa towns to try to get better. He also travelled about to watch productions of his operas, and to hear young singers."
"When Carl Maria von Weber died, he left an opera, ""Die drei Pintos"", unfinished. It was sent to Meyerbeer in the hope that he would finish it, but he did not seem interested. In the end Mahler finished it many years later."
"Meyerbeer made changes to ""Il crociato in Egitto"" and turned it into a grand opera for the Opéra in Paris. He changed it from an Italian to a French opera, composing extra dance music and a new overture. He was determined to be famous in Paris."
"In 1826 he married his cousin. They had two children, but they both died when they were very small."
"In 1828 Daniel Auber, a famous French composer of the time, had composed a very popular opera called ""La muette de Portici"". It was the first French grand opera. Meyerbeer realized he could not become really popular by turning his Italian operas into French grand opera, so he took his comic opera ""Robert le Diable"" and changed it into a grand opera. Audiences loved it. Within three years it had been performed in 77 theatres in 10 different countries. Many composers made their own arrangements of some of the tunes from the opera. He was given many honours: the Chevalier of the Legion d’honneur, the title of Prussian Hof Kapellmeister (Director of Music at the Royal Court), and was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and a member of the French Institute."
"Meyerbeer realized that anything else he wrote would have to be really good. In 1836 he produced another opera ""Les Huguenots"". This too was extremely popular."
"In 1842 he went to Boulogne to improve his health. There he met Wagner who asked him for financial help to stage his operas ""Rienzi"" and ""The Flying Dutchman"". Meyerbeer lent him money, but stopped giving him money when he heard that Wagner was secretly criticizing him."
Berlin years.
"When Spontini died Meyerbeer was made Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin. His opera ""Les Huguenots"" had at first been forbidden in Germany, but now it was allowed to be performed. As court composer he wrote a grand opera called ""Ein Feldschlag in Schlesien"" (""A Battle in Silesia""), but it never became internationally famous. The main part in the opera was sung by Jenny Lind."
Return to Paris.
"In 1849 he returned to Paris. He wrote several works together with Scribe, whom Meyerbeer described as the best living librettist, and who was one of his closest friends. His opera ""Le prophète"" (for which Scribe again wrote the words) earned him a lot of money. The great contralto Pauline Viardot-Garcia sang the main part."
"Scribe died in 1861. Meyerbeer worked very hard to try to finish his last opera, ""L’Africaine"". Napoleon III said he wanted the opera to be ready by the winter of 1862-63, but it was not ready until 1864. The work was being rehearsed for its first performance when Meyerbeer suddenly died, without having had the chance to revise it, the way he revised most of his other pieces."
Meyerbeer’s body was taken to Berlin where it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in a vault that belonged to his family.
Meyerbeer’s music.
"Meyerbeer was always more popular in France than in Germany. His operas are about the society of wealthy people. The sounds he made with his orchestra are often deliberately harsh. In this he is like Beethoven in his final years, and Berlioz. Sometimes he used new instruments such as the bass clarinet and the saxophone. He always thought carefully about what his singers were capable of when writing his music. He enjoyed working with different singers, among them Velluti, who was the last of the great operatic castrati. He took great trouble to give his singers rests during the opera so that they would still be in good voice for the climax of the story. He liked scenes with large crowds. He composed his dance music, in particular, very carefully. Often he would throw it away and start again if the dancers were not happy with it."

Bumblebee
"Bumblebees or ""bumble bees"", or ""humble bees"") are a group of social and semi-social bees, of the genus Bombus. The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also be found in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass."
"Most bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year (though the queen lasts longer). They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a ""pile"". It is the female worker bee which one sees out collecting pollen. The pollen is packed into two ""baskets"" on its hind, very noticeable when full. The baskets are just hairs specially adapted for this function."
"Most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a ""queen"", and there are ""workers"" and ""drones"". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies."
"Bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual Müllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps. Bumblebees are extremely hairy, and that also is a defence against birds. Young birds, particularly, find them difficult to handle. Some birds are regular predators of bumblebees: the great grey shrike (""Lanius excubitor"") and the bee-eaters for example."
Life cycle.
"Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The nests are smaller, usually much smaller, than those of hive bees. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera."
"Only fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. To develop, the larvae are fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein."
"Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. The eggs develop into males (drones) if they are not fertilised (haploid), and females if they are diploid."
"Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens (those fertilised eggs which are fed on nutritious food) and males leave the colony when they are mature. They mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle. The queens live a number of years. The workers (unfertilized females) live about a season. Drones live away from the hive(s). Queens do not mate with drones from their own hive."
"Bumblebees can fly very high. In 2014, ""National Geographic"" said bumblebees can fly higher than Mount Everest."
Nest size.
"Nest size ""according to the species"" is between 50 and 400 individuals. Colonies have been fiund as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees."
Nest types.
"Many species nest underground in old rodent burrows or sheltered places. They avoid direct sunlight, where nests might overheat. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. Stone-boring bees are found in limestone walls and cliffs, and sand borers are found in compact sand cliffs."
"A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter."
Parasitic bees.
"About ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives."
Sting.
"All bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened."
"They have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone."

"The bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source."
Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.
"The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching."
"When a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures."
Alternatives.
"A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric ""dry-heat"" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts."
"Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or ""bath""), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam."
Origin.
"Bains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated."
"The name comes from the medieval-Latin term ""balneum"" (or ""balineum"") ""Mariae""—literally, ""Mary's bath""—from which the French ""bain de Marie"", or ""bain-marie"", is derived. There are many theories as to how the name ""Marie"" came to be associated with this equipment:"
Creighton University

Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university are called the Blue Jays. They have 14 varsity teams, 13 of which compete in the Big East Conference. In women's rowing, a sport that the Big East does not sponsor, Creighton competes in the West Coast Conference."
Austin Peay State University
"Austin Peay State University is a public university in Clarksville, Tennessee. The university has about 10,723 students. It was founded in 1927. The current president of the university is Timothy Hall."
Sports.
The athletics teams of the university are called the Governors. They have 7 varsity teams and they compete in the Ohio Valley Conference.
Mercedes Ruehl
"Mercedes Ruehl (born February 28. 1948) is an American stage, television and motion picture actress. She was born in New York City. She is best known for her supporting role in the 1991 movie ""The Fisher King""."

"The University of Akron is a public, coeducational university in Akron, Ohio. The university has about 29,251 students. It was founded in 1870. The current president of the university is Luis M. Proenza."
Integrated Services Digital Network
"Integrated Services Digital Network is an international standard for a communication network. It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN, telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. This phone call is analogue. With ISDN, this view changes. As the signal is now digital ISDN can be used to offer a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes."
Channels.
"ISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels carry the actual service data. The two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax through one channel, while doing a phone call over the other channel, for example. If the main focus is on a high quality voice connection, the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically."
For larger companies it is possible to extend the number of data channels to 30 with still one signalling channel.
Werdenberg
"Werdenberg is a historical village in the canton of St. Gallen. It lies just outside Buchs. Today, between 55 and 60 people live there. There are about 40 houses, some of them only used for holidays. Werdenberg has a castle, which is often visited by tourists."
"There was a county of Werdenberg. It included the city itself, the villages of Grabs, Buchs, Sevelen and the right to judge in Wartau. The first count of Werdenberg died in 1182. In 1402, his successors let the county to the Count of Montfort-Tettnang. In 1485, it was sold to the City of Lucerne. In 1517, it was sold to the Canton of Glarus. During Napoleon's reign in Switzerland (called the Helvetic Republic, 1798-1803), Werdenberg was made part of the ""Canton of Linth"" (which also included the modern-day Canton of Glarus, and parts of the Canton of Schwyz). After the end of the reign, Werdenberg was made part of the canton of St. Gallen."
Édouard Manet
"Édouard Manet (pronounced ""edwaʁ manɛ"" in French), 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883, was a French Impressionist painter. He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism."
"Some of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings ""Lunch on the Grass"" and ""Olympia"" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called ""Impressionism""."
Life.
Training.
"Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre."
"While he was a student he visited Germany, Ano, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Velázquez and Goya."
"In 1856, Manet opened his own studio. Culo of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red"
"In 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings."
Impressionism.
"Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the ""Salon de Paris"". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called ""Lunch on the Grass"" (""Le déjeuner sur l'herbe""). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude)."
"At this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the ""Salon des Refuses"" which showed all the pictures that had been ""refused"". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new ""movement"" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to."
"In 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called ""Impressionists"" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are ""figurative"" (they are pictures of people)."
"Manet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad."
Manet died of syphilis in Paris at the age of 51. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery in the city.
Khat
"Khat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Ethiopia, Oman, and Yemen."
"Khat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m."
"Khat is used as a stimulant in Eritrea, Somalia, and Yemen the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee."
Problems.
"There are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. It is illegal to use in many countries, though not in Yemen."
"Muharraq is Bahrain's second largest city and is also called the ""Place of Ashes""."
1997 Qayen earthquake
"The 1997 Qayen earthquake was a large earthquake that struck in Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997. It was also known as the Quayen, Ardekul or Qaen earthquake. It was the largest in that area since 1990 and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. It was the third earthquake in 1997 that caused a lot of damage. It killed 1,567 people and injured over 2,300. It also left 50,000 homeless by damaging over 15,000 homes. There were 155 aftershocks that added to the damage, which was guessed to cost about $100 million."
The United States Geological Survey said that it was the most deadly earthquake in 1997.
Wind turbine
"A wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator."
Turning the generator.
"The wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning slowly, at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a reduction gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no reduction gearbox at all, and have a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox turns the generator more quickly, at around 1000 rpm, at a low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm. This combined electricity may be used locally, or adjusted to match the electricity in the power grid and sent to the power grid."
Environmental Impact.
"Although wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment as a result of generating power, they have an environmental impact. Some people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look unappealing. However, wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters from residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner."
Wet-tail
"Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24–48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age."
Causes.
"Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, ""Lawsonia intracellularis"". Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by:"
Symptoms.
"The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are:"
Treatment.
There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease.
Luxury box
"The luxury box or luxury suite is the North American term for a special seating section in arenas, stadiums and other sports venues. In the United Kingdom and Australia the terms used are corporate box, executive box, sky box and private box. They are usually in the mid-section of the stadium. The seats have usually the best views of the sporting event. Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to the action of the sporting event. The inside of a luxury box usually has a bar, several televisions sets, a row of seats and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered. The lease to a box also comes with a personal parking space, and a private entrance. The boxes usually generate more revenue than regular seating."
Contactless smart card
A contactless smart card is a kind of smart card with integrated circuits that can process and save data. Most cards are as big as a credit card. They can receive information which is processed and delivered through radio. There are two main kinds of contactless smart cards.
"Many people believe contactless smart cards have a read-only RFID inside it. This is not true, but they do have a re-writable smart card microchip inside them. Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and saving data."
Pericles' Funeral Oration
"Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war."
"At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead."
Leader.
"The Government is led by the Prime Minister, who chooses the other Ministers. The Prime Minister and the other most powerful Ministers belong to a group known as the Cabinet, who are the most important decision makers in the Government. These ministers are all members of Parliament (MPs). Laws are made by MPs voting in Parliament, which is called 'legislative authority'. These laws make what is called primary legislation."
"The Prime Minister now is Rishi Sunak, the present leader of the Conservative Party. Liz Truss, the former leader, was only Prime Minister for a short time and had succeeded Boris Johnson, who had been Prime Minister from 2019 until his resignation in 2022."
Election.
"The government is chosen by the people indirectly. The people of the United Kingdom vote in a general election, appointing representatives to the Parliament, at least once every five years. The monarch must select as Prime Minister the person who is likely to have the support of Parliament. By convention, that is normally the leader of the party that has the most MPs in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister leads the government and exercises executive power on behalf of the monarch, in accordance with the laws set by Parliament, including appointing Ministers to the executive branches of government."
"Under the British constitution, laws are made or unmade by Parliament. The policy and administration of the laws is done by the direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. This is called executive authority. The monarch is obliged to follow the advice of the government and has not refused to do so since the 17th century. The Cabinet members advise the monarch as part of a group called Privy Council. They also use their power directly as leaders of the Government departments."
The British kind of government is sometimes called parliamentary government.
Local governments.
"There are separate governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each responsible to their own local parliament. These parliaments have certain limits decided by the main parliament in Westminster. There is no separate English Parliament."
Margaux Hemingway
"Margot Louise Hemingway (February 16, 1954-July 1, 1996), later called Margaux Hemingway, was an American actress and fashion model. She was born in Portland, Oregon. She was the sister of Mariel Hemingway. On July 1, 1996, the day before the anniversary of her grandfather Ernest Hemingway's own suicide, Margaux killed herself: she overdosed with a drug called phenobarbital. She was found dead inside her apartment in Santa Monica, California."
Styx (moon)
"Styx (formerly known as S/2012 (134340) 1 and informally as P5) is a small moon of the dwarf planet Pluto. It was discovered on June 26, 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope. It is the fifth moon of Pluto discovered so far. The others are Charon, discovered in 1978, Nix and Hydra, which were discovered in 2005, and Kerberos, discovered in 2011."
Discovery.
"The moon was discovered using nine sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by Wide Field Camera 3 of the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced the discovery on 11 July 2012. The images were taken as part of a Hubble survey searching for potential hazards for the New Horizons mission. The New Horizons space probe is going to Pluto at the moment and will arrive in July 2015. The discovery of the moon has made scientists worried about the mission. Pluto may have more bodies, such as dust or rings, orbiting it which cannot be found. These bodies could damage the New Horizons probe. The current plan for New Horizons is that it will pass just inside the orbit of Charon. But this could change if scientists think that the space probe will be damaged."
Physical properties.
"The moon is 10 to 25 km across. Because of its small size, it is likely to be irregular in shape. The moon is very faint, about one one-hundred-thousandth as bright as Pluto. The moon is likely to be made of water ice."
Orbital properties.
"Styx orbits the centre of mass of Pluto and Charon at a distance of around 42,000 km. This is in between the orbits of Charon and Nix. The orbital path of the moon is very nearly circular, like the other moons of Pluto. The moon orbits in the same orbital plane as the other moons. The moon takes around 20 days to orbit Pluto."
Origin.
The moon system around Pluto may exist because of a collision of Pluto with a large Kuiper belt body a very long time ago. Pluto’s moons may have formed from the scattered pieces of rock left behind after the collision.
The Doon School
"The Doon School (informally ""Doon School"" or ""Doon"") is a boys-only private boarding school in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. The school was founded by Satish Ranjan Das, a Calcutta lawyer. Doon's first headmaster was Arthur E. Foot, a former science master at Eton College. The present headmaster is Peter McLaughlin, who has occupied the post since 2009 and is the ninth headmaster of the school."
"The school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Doon pupils take the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education in tenth grade and are thereafter offered two strands for the final two years: International Baccalaureate (IB) or Indian School Certificate (ISC). The school began offering the IB curriculum only in 2006, before which all pupils had to sit the ISC examinations in twelfth grade."
"Doon has consistently been ranked among the best residential schools of India by media such as ""The Times of India"" and ""Outlook"". Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including President Pratibha Patil, to become coeducational. Former students of the school are commonly known as ""Doscos"". Although the total number of Doscos is relatively small (estimated at 5,000 since the school's founding), they include some of India's most prominent politicians, government officials and business leaders. The best known alumnus is former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi."
Maria Muldaur
"Maria Muldaur (born in New York City, September 12, 1943) is an American singer and songwriter. Her birth name was Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato. She is a folk-blues singer who contributed to the revival of American folk music in the early 1960s and recorded the 1974 hit song ""Midnight at the Oasis""."
"Cyon's first generation cell-phones were bar-types. Upon entering year 2000, second generation came to be folder style. In 2002, the third generation of slide-phones were introduced. In 2007, Cyon presented touch phones with the latest technology. Cyon cellphones have functions such as cameras, wireless internet, DMB TV, Blue-tooth and USB memory chip."
Battle of the year
"Battle of the year (acronym BOTY) is a worldwide breakdancing tournament held every year. In 1990, Thomas Hergenröther founded BOTY in Hannover, Germany. There were 9 crews and 400 visitors at that time. As break-dancing became more popular, BOTY grew in size and found a new location in Braunschweig, Germany."
"Regional BOTY (BOTY France, BOTY Korea and so on) first takes place to choose a single crew that will represent each nation in the upcoming BOTY international. Representing crews compete against each other first in a showcase in which every crew presents their own choreographed performances within 6 minutes or so. According to the rankings of the showcase, 2 semi finals in total between 1st and 4th crew and 2nd and 3rd crew takes place. The final battle follows between the winners of the semi finals to judge the champion crew of the year."
"Judging Criteria for a showcase include; synchronicity, stage-presence, theme &amp; music and choreography."
"Criteria for individual B-Boys include; top rock, footwork, freeze and power move."
"Criteria for a battle include; response, routines, strategy and attitude."
Takahiro Matsumoto
"Takahiro ""Tak"" Matsumoto (born March 27, 1961 in Toyonaka, Osaka) is a Japanese guitarist. He is the lead arranger of rock band B'z."
Foot binding
"Foot binding is an old Chinese custom of wrapping girls' feet with cloth in order to stop them from growing with age. Some Chinese legends say people started binding women's feet as early as the Shang dynasty (1700–1027 BCE). However, writing says that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). It lasted until the early 20th century, when it was banned by the People's Republic of China."
"Foot binding was a sign of social status. If a woman's feet were bound, it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work. However, foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status. By the 17th century, Chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound."
Some people think that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure. Some people also see foot binding as insulting to women. But other people argue that this view is biased against the Chinese culture in favor of modern Western standards.
"Foot binding usually tried to make the feet about long, at most. Some drastic things were done at times to try to do this. Because of this, women who had their feet bound would usually be impaired, or damaged, for the rest of their lives. The physical consequences (or results) of foot binding stayed in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women in their 70s and 80s (according to a study published by the University of San Francisco}."
"When the Manchuria created the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote many laws banning foot binding. However, the laws did not work very well. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee (meeting of people) was held in Shanghai by a British priest. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the republican government kept trying to stop foot binding. They gave fines (orders to pay money) to women who still had their feet bound after 1915. During the early 20th century, western fashion was affecting China more and more. The People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding, although this was not very successful in actually ending the practice. According to Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women stopped making those shoes in 1998, in Harbin, China."
Udenhout
Udenhout is a town in The Netherlands. In 1232 the abbey of Tongerlo was started which grew into the village that is now called Udenhout.
Udenhout has been part of the municipality of Tilburg since 1997.
History of Udenhout.
"There was a pilgrim who arrived after long reis going in Udenhout. He knocked in a castle whose lord was hospitable. He knew that he could spend the night. When he did not aanklopte castle or one of his employees open, but a buck driver. They were descendants of Hugo de bokkerijder. They were murdered and their lord moved into the castle. The pilgrim told how God would think about. But, they are not much of. The pilgrim was thrown from the castle. He walked across and looked at again. But the castle was gone. God had heard his word and the goats driver punished. Since then we call this the castle sunk castle. There is also a district that is named after this castle and also the shape and construction of a real castle. But the actual castle is still not found."
HY
"HY is a Japanese rock music band formed in year 2000 by five high school friends in Okinawa. Their name comes from the initials of their hometown, Higashi Yakena. The band became popular by performing music in the streets. Their first album ""Departure"" (Okinawa-only) sold out immediately. In 2002, the band did a live performance with American group, Linkin Park."
Mount Kisco
"Mount Kisco is a village and a town in Westchester County, in the state of New York. One story says it was named after an Algonquian Native American chief who once lived in the area. There is another story which says that the name came from the Algonquian word meaning the ""edge of creekland"", or ""a muddy place"". It is a suburban town about 40 minutes from New York City by car. There is also a train to New York. The village has more than 10,000 people, who live in an area of 3.1 square miles. There are approximately 2,500 families living in Mount Kisco."
"Mount Kisco is a part of the Bedford School District, which has five elementary schools, one middle school, and a high school. The village is run by a Mayor and four trustees. It has a commercial hub in the center of the village. Around the Mount Kisco Library are the shopping corridors on South Monger Avenue. Mount Kisco is a relatively quiet town; however, it is currently suffering from increased traffic."
History.
"It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means ""fun"" (""lollig"" means ""funny""). In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say ""utter nonsense"" in Welsh, they would say ""rwtsh lol"". LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging."
Toronto
Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario in Canada. It is also the largest city in both Ontario and Canada. It is found on the north-west side of Lake Ontario.
"The City of Toronto itself has a population of almost 3 million people. Even more people live in the regions around it. All together, the Greater Toronto Area is home to over 6 million people. This makes it the biggest metropolitan area in Canada."
History.
"Toronto was created in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe as the capital of what was then called ""Upper Canada"". At the time it was called the ""Town of York"" after the Duke of York. The name was changed to Toronto in 1834. With the Canadian Confederation in 1867, it became the capital of the newly created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with Montreal in Quebec) that wanted to be the capital of Canada. Queen Victoria decided that Ottawa should be the national capital because it was located between the two."
"As the 19th century moved on, the city began to grow. This was mainly because of immigration, where people from all over the world left their home and moved to Canada. Many of the immigrants were Irish people. They brought their Catholic faith with them when they left Ireland because of the Irish Potato Famine."
"During World War I and World War II, Toronto was used to train members of the Canadian Army. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the Government of Ontario decided to create Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, combining a number of local municipalities. These were Old Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough."
"By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. Because of that, the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a ""megacity"" in 1998. The first mayor of Toronto was Mel Lastman. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events. These included World Youth Day in 2002, WorldPride in 2014, and the 2015 Pan American Games."
"On April 23, 2018 a white van collided with numerous pedestrians killing nine and injuring sixteen others at Yonge Street."
Climate.
"Toronto has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: ""Dfa"")."
Things to see and do.
"Toronto has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the lake is not big enough to keep its temperature mild."
"As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of North America, Toronto is a popular destination for tourists. It is where you can find the CN Tower, which is the tallest free-standing (not supported) structure in the Americas and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. There are some other buildings, including the City Hall and the Rogers Centre, that are well known for their design style. There are many skyscrapers, because many large banks of Canada and other companies have their main offices in Toronto, and the Toronto Stock Exchange which is the biggest stock market in Canada."
"Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where the provincial government meets. Visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park. There are museums, including the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario Science Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the suburbs of the city is the Toronto Zoo and Canada's Wonderland. Many visitors also like to go to Niagara Falls, just an hour's drive away from Toronto."
"Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the downtown area are shopping centres, including the Eaton Centre, St. Lawrence Market, and the Distillery District. There are several theatres, many which are run by the Mirvish family. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, opened in June 2006, is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Across the harbor are the Toronto Islands, the best known of which is Centre Island."
"Toronto has many sports teams. Some of them belong to the most commonly-followed leagues in North America. They include the Toronto Maple Leafs in ice hockey (NHL) and the Toronto Raptors in basketball (NBA), both of which play in the Air Canada Centre. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team plays. BMO Field in Exhibition Place is home to the Toronto Argonauts in Canadian football and Toronto F.C., a soccer club."
"Toronto is a very multicultural city. Different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Greektown, Little Portugal, and other places where different cultures are kept alive. These people hold festivals where they share their culture with others. Among the most popular is the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), which happens every year in August."
Transport.
"Like many cities around the world, Toronto has an airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport. There are flights to many places in Canada and the rest of the world. The airport is just northwest of the city centre. Since 2015, there has been a train service, the Union Pearson Express. It goes from the airport to Downtown in less than half an hour."
"Toronto's main public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The main part of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system. That system includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1 and east–west Line 2. A light metro line also exists, exclusively serving the eastern district of Scarborough. A discussion is underway to replace it with a heavy-rail line. The TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars. The streetcars serve the downtown core. The buses provide service to many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network."
"The Government of Ontario also operates a commuter rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually. Most of them travel to or from Union Station. GO Transit is implementing RER (Regional Express Rail) into its system."
Housing.
Housing in Toronto was ranked as 10th-least affordable in the world. The study compared Toronto with ninety other metropolitan areas in different countries. Hong Kong came in as the least affordable place to live in.
English numerals
Here are some words for small numbers. Words in bold are irregular.
"When writing other numbers between 21 and 99, you must use a hyphen, like a minus sign (-)."
"The number 100 is written as ""one hundred"", but in general, sometimes people can say ""a hundred""."
"The way numbers are written and spoken differs between American English and other forms of English, such as British English and Australian English, as follows."

Locating (physics)
"The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what ""to locate"" or ""location"" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something."
"For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, ""Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone."" Or, in another case we might say, ""Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles."
"If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, ""Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."""
"Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar."
"It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion."
"Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction."
Let 'Em In
"""Let 'Em In"" is a single released in 1976, performed by Paul McCartney. The song reached the Top 3 in the United States and across the United Kingdom. This single has been covered and sampled by other musicians."
Trajectory
"The Trajectory something follows is its path through space and time. If a cannon is fired, its shell will follow a certain path depending on how much was used, how heavy the is, and the up and down that the cannon is aimed at."
Ed Dyas
"Edmund C. Dyas (November 11, 1939 – January 23, 2011) was an American football player. He played college football from 1958 to 1960 for the Auburn Tigers. He finished fourth for the Heisman Trophy in his senior season. Dyas was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009."
"Dyas became an orthopedic surgeon in Mobile, Alabama after his college football career. He died from stomach cancer on January 23, 2011 at the age of 71."
"Wayne County, Michigan"
"Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, 1,820,584 people lived there. It is the 18th most-populous county in the United States. The county seat is Detroit which is the largest city in Michigan."
History.
"Wayne County was one of the first counties formed when the Northwest Territory was created. It was named for the American general ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne. When it was created, the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and small sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were part of Wayne County. On August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were set to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point."
"On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, changed the boundary. This new boundary included Chicago, Illinois and a large strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan."
These boundaries were later changed again when Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were created in Michigan Territory.
Geography.
"The county has a total area of . Of this, (or 91.36%) is land and (or 8.64%) is water Parts of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair are included in the county."
"The eastern boundary is a water boundary in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair with Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Cars crosses this boundary at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge."
Grosse Ile is the largest island in Wayne County. It is connected to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge.
Examinations.
The RCO offers five qualifications or diplomas.
ARCO
"ARCO (short for Atlantic Richfield Company, the original name) is a United States oil company. It has operationsn 2 in the United States, Indonesia, the North Sea, and the South China Sea. As of July 2011, it had more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States."
ARCO's original parent companies included:
"The two companies merged in 1966, and bought Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1969. In 1978, ARCO opened its first ampm convenience store."
"Between 1970 and 2000, ARCO had a complicated corporate history. By 1985, it sold its Eastern US business to a new Atlantic Petroleum. In 2000, the remaining Western US business was bought by British Petroleum (BP). Finally, in 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion."
Oil discovery.
"In 1957, Richfield was the first to drill for oil in Alaska. On July 15 of that year they struck oil with their first well. It was the first major oil discovery in Alaska and tested at 900 barrels a day. In 1968 they partnered with Exxon for Alaska North Slope oil production. In 1980, they were the seventh largest oil company in the United States."
Skating
Skating refers and involves any sport or recreational activity that involves traveling on dry surface or ice using skates.
"There are many varieties of skating, such as:"
Economic bubble
"An economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value. This increase is followed by a quick decrease in value, called a ""crash"" or a ""bubble burst"". Economic bubbles can be caused by many things, but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation. An economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a loss of investment both by companies and individuals, such as the Great Depression or the Economic crisis of 2007-2010."
"An economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity. The market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand. Prices may eventually fall when supply increases beyond the demand, resulting in the bursting of the bubble. Predicting when this will happen is difficult, hence it may surprise investors."
Population without double counting
Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English.
"In France, because of the census, the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice, so as to show how the population moves. Because of this, each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it. For example, students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study (the place they were born in). It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born."
Glass transition
The glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification.
"The glass transition temperature ""T""g is always lower than the melting temperature, ""T""m, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Above a glass transition temperature, a plastic is rubbery. Below the glass transition temperature, a plastic is solid. Thermosets, or thermo-setting plastics, burn up before they reach their melt temperature, but most thermosets also undergo glass transition."
Uncle Tom's Cabin
"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published in 1852. It greatly influenced many people's thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States. It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. This led to the American Civil War. The book's effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War, ""So this is the little lady who made this big war."""
"The main character of the novel is Uncle Tom, a patiente sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery. It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery."
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the most popular novel of the 19th century, and the second best-selling book of the century (the first one was the Bible). It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s."
"In these days, it has been praised as a very important help to anti-slavery. However, it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people."
"In short, moksha symbolizes something which is beyond comprehension; too great and too wondrous to be truly understood, it can only be felt when one attains it. The world is truly a beautiful place, but the greatness that lies within is even more so, since the power of the greatness is completely unknown."
"After all, isn't that what beauty is; appreciation of the unknown!"
For a more comprehensive explanation of this topic read the books:
Moksha is the ultimate goal of a person to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death
Caste
"The caste system is a system in India that was once mainly used by Hindus. This system has been generally accepted for about 3000 years. There are four castes in this system, and one outcast group regarded as ""untouchables"". There are also castes in countries other than India as the system spread to South Asia about 2000 years ago. For centuries, this system has dictated one's marriages, geographical location, and occupation. People must not marry someone from another caste, and they must not do things that another caste does. The Indian government today works to decrease this discrimination with the quotas set in government jobs in 1950."
Brahmin
Brahmin is one of the part of four varnas in Hinduism. Brahmins are the highest and most respected among people. In ancient India people who read the complete Upanishad Brahmanak were called Brahmins
Caste system.
"The caste system classified people by jobs. The people in this caste were mostly priests and dramatists in the Aryan society. The Brahmins arranged prayers and rituals. Parashurama was one of the well known Brahmin by birth, but throughout his life, he was a warrior whose job was to protect Dharma. Parshurama is also Creator Father of Bhumihar Brahman and Bhumihar Thakur, Bhumihar's are also known as Parashurama Brahman &amp; Bramhkshatriya. Most Brahmins practice vegetarianism. An old tradition is that Brahmin Men pulled there foreskin back since childhood, with an Glansring, because of became clean in this part"
"There are many subgroups in Brahmins based on demography. Rishiswar, Sanadhya, Kanyakubj, Telang, Saryupareen, Bhumihar, Goswami, Tyagi, and Saraswati are the main streams of Brahmin. Across the subcontinent, other Brahmins are also believed to have switched from the traditional duties of Brahmins in favor of military and administrative ones. In other parts of the subcontinent, outside of Punjab and the Gandhara region, they have been known as the Tyagi Brahman and ""brahma-kshatriya"" groups. These groups also claim to have descended from the Parshuram Tyagi Brahmans of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh; traditionally, they have a close relationship and brotherhood with Mohyals."
"Some Mohyal Brahmins migrated eastward and became as some sub-divisions of Bhumihar Brahmins, some of whom are also descendants of Hussaini Brahmins and mourn the death of Imam Hussain.[7] Bhumihar Brahmins and Tyagi/ Mohyal Brahmins have an affinity and brotherhood for each other. The  Bhumihar Brahmins, of whom many, though not all, belong to the Saryupareen Brahmin division of Kanyakubja Brahmins.In Kerala Ezhavathy is also a Mohyal community.[8]"
The Brahmins of Vedic Period.
"The Brahmanas of the Vedic period were regarded as the most knowledgeable people and the best of best in all arts. Therefore, not all Hindus worship other Gods."
The sub-groups.
"In Tamil Nadu, The Iyers and Iyengars are well known Brahmin communities. Iyers are mostly worshippers of Shiva and the Iyengars are Vaishnavites."
DNA.
"The majority of the Males in Brahmin caste belong to of Y-DNA R1a1* Haplogrup, interestingly the same Haplogroup can be found view in the Roma people too"
Kshatriya
"Kshatriya is a division of the caste system in Hinduism. A ""kshatriya"" is a warrior, ruler, politician, or administrative worker."
There are 3 lineages of Kshatriyas:-
"However, there is one more lineage (not mentioned in any Puranas) - Nagavanshi (snake-born), who claims descent from the Nagas."
Vaishya
"Vaishya is a division of the caste system. A vaishya is a trader, merchant or artisan."
Shudra
Shudra is a division of the caste system. A shudra is considered a servant or peasant. Shudra and Ati-shudra indicates the bottom most ranks in the Indian caste system.
"Mahatma Jyotirao Phule set out the history of shudra-ati-shudra communities in his book ""Gulamgiri."" He drew the attention to the exploitation of Shudras, Ati-shudras, and women etc. At this time, most prefer not even to touch such castes."
"The Separatists decided to leave England for the Dutch Republic (where religious freedom was permitted). William Bradford went with them. It was illegal to leave England. The group was betrayed by an English sea captain who brought them to the English authorities. Most of the congregation, and Bradford, were put into prison. By the summer of 1608, the Separatists, and William Bradford, escaped to Leiden, Netherlands. Bradford was 18."
In the Dutch Republic.
"William Bradford moved to Amsterdam in August 1608. He lived with the Brewsters in Stink Alley. The Separatists had spent most of their money leaving England and were poor. After nine months, the congregation moved to the smaller city of Leiden."
When Bradford turned 21 he received some money. Bradford purchased his own house. He built a workshop and worked as a weaver. He was liked.
"In 1613, Bradford married Dorothy May, the daughter of a rich English couple living in Amsterdam. In 1617, the Bradfords had their first child, John Bradford."
"By 1617, the Separatists decided to travel to Virginia Colony in North America. The Separatists could practice their religion in the Dutch Republic, they wanted their children to keep their English customs and language. The colonists made a business arrangement with the Merchant Adventurers. These were a group of men who were willing to pay for the Pilgrims to go to the New World with the promise that the pilgrims would pay them back with furs and other goods they got from the colony. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the plans and fifty Separatists left Delftshaven on the ship ""Speedwell""."
"Many families were split as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy's parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage."
Departure.
"The ""Speedwell"" planned to meet with the ""Mayflower"" and both ships would travel to Virginia Colony. The ""Speedwell"" proved unsafe and the passengers were put on the ""Mayflower"". This made the ship very crowded. Not all the passengers were Separatists. There were about 50 colonists who went because they had certain skills. These skills would prove useful on the ""Mayflower"" and at the colony. Bradford said they hugged each other and cried and said goodbye to family and friends for the last time. They knew they were pilgrims and lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and this comforted them."
The Mayflower Voyage.
"The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" spotted land. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Bradford signed the Mayflower Compact."
Anchored and first explorations at Plymouth Colony.
"Up to this time, Bradford, aged 30, had never been a leader in the colony. When the ""Mayflower"" anchored in the Harbor, the men went out to explore the land for a place where they could live. Bradford volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties. In November and December, these parties went out three times on foot and by boat."
"One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Indians during his time at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, ""and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed"". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians."
"They located a place that would be Plymouth Colony in December. During the first expedition on foot, Bradford was caught up in a deer trap made by Native Americans and brought upside down. During the third exploration, on 6 December 1620, Bradford and the other men found Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they came near the bay. The explorers were very cold and started to get sick. The waves were high but they landed on Clark's Island."
"During this time, they searched areas all around the bay and found a place to live and build their homes. The location had a large hill. This hill is now called Burial Hill. It was a good place to build a fort for safety against any possible enemies. There were many brooks providing water. They would later find out that the site had been the location of a Native American village known as Patuxet; and that is why a large area had already been cleared for planting of food. The Patuxet tribe of Indians, between 1616 and 1619, had all died from bad sickness. Bradford later wrote that bones of the dead were easy to find in many places."
Plymouth Colony.
Great sickness.
"The ""Mayflower"" arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony's first house on 25 December."
"On January 11, 1621, as Bradford was helping to build houses when he was got a great pain in his hipbone and fell. Bradford was taken to the ""common house"" (the only house that was finished) and they thought he would die that night, but he did not."
"Bradford got well but many of the pilgrims were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621 sometimes two or three people died every day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. They buried their dead in secret so the Native Americans would not see how many were dying. They buried them in Cole's Hill and tried to also hide the graves from the animals."
"There were only a small number of men who were healthy. Everyone, including the children had to work and care for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish. He was a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to protect the people of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness. They became good friends. Bradford had no military experience and when he became governor he would come to trust Captain Standish's advice on military matters."
William was chosen by the people to be Governor of Plymouth Colony. He kept journals (a written record) which are very important even today because they are the only history of how the Mayflower passengers and their families lived in Plymouth Colony. He died before he could finish the second book.
Early service as governor.
"On March 16, the settlers had their first meeting with the Native Americans who lived in the region. Samoset, an Indian walked into the village of Plymouth and greeted them in English. Samoset had learned some English from the traders who had visited the area he was from. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe. At that meeting, Massassoit made a treaty with Governor John Carver. The treaty said that they would be friends and protect each other against unfriendly Indians."
Bradford wrote down what was said. He would soon become governor and the treaty that was very important was the promise to help each other. This agreement was not liked by Massasoit's enemies in other tribes.
"In April 1621, Governor Carver became sick while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor. Bradford would remain governor most of his life."
"The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony was at first a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony's history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, it was changed to five assistants. This was called the ""governor's council"". These men gave advice to the governor and had a vote on important matters. They helped Bradford in managing the Colony. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland."
Family.
"William Bradford married Dorothy in Amsterdam, Holland on December 10, 1613. They had one son. Dorothy fell from the deck of the Mayflower into the water and drowned a short time after the ship landed. Her husband was on an exploring mission. John was born in Leiden, Holland and died in 1620."
His second wife was Alice Southwarth in Plymouth. They had three children. She died in Plymouth in March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband.

Sándor Szokolay
"Sándor Szokolay (30 March 1931 – 8 December 2013) was an Hungarian composer and a professor of the Liszt Ferenc Academy, Budapest."
"Szokolay was born on 30 March 1931 in Kunágota, Hungary. He was chairman of the Hungarian Kodály Society (1978) and the Hungarian Music Camera (1991–92), and he is member of the Hungarian Széchenyi Art Academy (1992). Szokolay died on 8 December 2013 in Sopron from pneumonia, Hungary, aged 82."
Meg Mundy
"Margaret ""Meg"" Mundy (4 January 1915 – 12 January 2016) was an English-American actress. She was born in London, but moved to the United States at the age of six in 1921. She played ""Mona Aldrich Croft"", on ""The Doctors"" from 1971 until 1982, when the show was cancelled. She was nominated for two Daytime Emmy Awards for her role as Croft."
"Mundy's mother was an Australian opera singer. Mundy was married to Mark Daniels from 1943 until they divorced in 1951. Then she was married to Konstantinos ""Dino"" Yannopoulos until his death in 1985. They had one child. Mundy now lives in Manhattan, New York."
Kingdom Hearts III
"Kingdom Hearts III is a action role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. It is the eighth game for the ""Kingdom Hearts"" video game series. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ""Kingdom Hearts III"" is the first game in the series to be released on a Microsoft platform as it was only released on both Sony and Nintendo systems."
Development.
"After years of rumors and speculation, the game was confirmed to be in development at E3 2013. Director Tetsuya Nomura said that the game will finish the ""Xehanort Saga"" but that it would not be the final game in the series."
"In a June 2013 interview with ""Famitsu"", Nomura discussed the visuals that were seen in the teaser trailer. He said that they tried to remember that the ""Kingdom Hearts characters were originally paintbrush art from Disney productions, a texture that was one of our original aims, and that it was time to return to that. So [chief creative director Takeshi] Nozue went through a series of tests, and the results are the visuals that we refer to in the team as the Kingdom Shader. It may look like a pretty drastic change, but I see it as a rich evolution of everything we've shown you up to now."" In September 2013, producer Shinji Hashimoto said that since both ""Kingdom Hearts III"" and ""Final Fantasy XV"" are being directed by Nomura, there would be a big gap between the release of the two games, ""as [they] want each game to be perfect in terms of quality."" Hashimoto repeated Nomura's statements about the game's announcement at E3 2013, and said that ""the company thought it was about time it addressed speculation about the long-awaited conclusion to the trilogy."" In October 2013, Teruzane Utada, the father of singer Hikaru Utada, said that Hikaru would once again be involved in the theme song, as she did with ""Kingdom Hearts"" and ""Kingdom Hearts II"". He later stated that it is still undecided on their involvement. In January 2014, actor Haley Joel Osment, the English voice of Sora in the series, said that he was in talks with the development team after the announcement and said that since dialogue was one of the last parts of the process, he believed he would not begin recording until mid-2014 at the earliest."
Controversy.
"After the announcement of SQUARE ENIX that there would be no French Spanish and German voice (present in the 1 and 2) European fans launched the movement # EUDubbingForKH3 which aims to change his opinion SE and he includes (real) German and Spanish French voice through petition, letter etc."
Watchman
"Watchmen were groups of men who discouraged crime and enforced the law. They were usually authorised by the state or government. Watchmen have existed in many places around the world throughout history. Today, the job of law enforcement has generally been taken over by organised police."
An early reference to a watch can be found in the Bible. Ezekiel says that it was the watchmen's duty to sound the alarm to warn the people that they were under attack (Ezekiel 33:1-6). The Roman Empire turned the role of a watchman into a profession. The Vigiles was the city watch in Rome. It was the city's police force.
"In England, the Ordinance of 1233 required the appointment of watchmen. The Assize of Arms of 1252 and the Statute of Winchester of 1285 are considered among the earliest examples of a police in England. The Assize of Arms required that constables be appointed to call men to fight when the town was under attack. It also required them to stop disturbances of the peace, and to take criminals to the sheriff. By 1415, a watch was appointed to the Parliament of England. King Henry VII appointed a watch for his house, the Tower of London, in 1485. These watchmen became known as the Beefeaters."
SpaceShipOne
"SpaceShipOne is a vehicle built to travel to the lower limits of outer space. It completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004. That same year, it won the US$10 million Ansari X Prize and has not flown since winning. It was carried high into the air by a specially designed plane named ""White Knight"". Both vehicles were built and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures. This was a joint project between Paul Allen and Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan's flying machine company. Allen provided the money to build and fly SpaceShipOne, about US$25 million."
"Rutan has said that ideas about the project began as early as 1994. The full-time work towards the 2004 accomplishments took about three years. The vehicle first flew faster than the speed of sound on December 17, 2003. This date was also the one-hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic first powered flight. SpaceShipOne's first official spaceflight, was piloted by Mike Melvill. A few days before that flight, the Mojave Air and Space Port was the first commercial spaceport licensed in the United States. A few hours after that flight, Melvill became the first licensed U.S. commercial astronaut. The overall project name was ""Tier One"". It has evolved into Tier 1b with a goal of taking a new, but similar ship's first paying passengers into space within the next few years."
Pavel Eljanov
Pavel Eljanov (born 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
"Eljanov's most notable tournament result to date was winning Corus B tournament 2007 in Wijk aan Zee, Holland with a score of 9/13. This result enabled him to qualify for the category 20 tournament Corus A 2008."
"On the September 2010 FIDE rating list, Eljanov had a rating of 2761, making him number 1 in Ukraine and number 6 in the world. His results in the Russian premier league had been exceptional. Since then he has slipped to #21."
Lactase
"Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested."
"Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea."
Lactase evolution in humans.
"Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism."
The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk.
Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers.
Genetics.
"A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives."
"This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait."
"Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution."
Tanduay
"Tanduay Rhum is an alcoholic drink from the Philippines. It is produced by Tanduay Distillers Inc., and with origins dating from 1854."
Asia Brewery
"Asia Brewery is a brewery founded in 1982 in Makati City, the Philippines. It is one of only two breweries in the Philippines, and is the smaller of the two, with only 10% market share.

"It offers eight beers in the Philippines with its flagship brand Beer na Beer launched in 1988 as Beer Pale Pilsen. It changed its name to Beer na Beer after lawsuits by other breweries using the term pale pilsen. In 2001, Beer na Beer was reformulated and now has 6.0% alcohol volume."
"ABI's seven other beers are sold on a somewhat limited scale, but its Colt 45 brand, launched in 1995, is the biggest among them. This malt liquor's biggest competitor is Red Horse Extra Strong from San Miguel. ABI's other licensed brands are Carlsberg (the brewery's first beer in 1987), Lone Star (launched in 2000), Lone Star Light (2002), Colt Ice (2003), Lone Star ULTRA (the country's first low-carb beer, launched in 2004, Stag (either cancelled or it's just hard to find in the country), and Coors (2008)."
"The company also offers Absolute distilled drinking water, the second biggest-selling bottled water brand in the market behind SMC's Wilkins, and Summit mineral water. They are both launched in 1992."
"In 1995, Q Shandy was launched to compete with SMC's Cali. In 1999, Pacific Sun iced tea was launched. In 2009, Asia Brewery introduced Feelgood, the first juice drink in the Philippines to contain prebiotics."
"Asia Brewery entered the low-priced carbonated soft drinks market by acquiring a license to produce Virgin Cola from Virgin Drinks. They are responsible in distributing products such as Summit Vitaminwater, ZeroCal and 100Plus."
"In 2008, Asia Brewery partnered with Cobra International Beverage Holdings, Inc. introduced the Philippine version of Cobra Energy Drink, is the ready-to-drink energy drink now in the Philippine market."

Optical gain medium
"An optical gain medium (also called an ""active laser medium"") can make light stronger. In general, gain media must be powered by another energy source in order to have energy to provide as light. Some gain media can be powered using electricity, but many others need light energy from bright flash lamps or a laser. Optical gain media are used in lasers. The first lasers used artificial ruby as their optical gain medium."
Microvillus
"Microvillus (plural microvilli) is a very tiny hair-like membrane in the body. The microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell. In humans, the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area. They are good for absorbing things and for secreting things. They are found in many places in a human body including the ear, the tongue, the nose and the intestines."
"On a tongue, the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain. These signals are interpreted by the brain, and tells the brain what things taste like. Over time, as a person tastes more and more things, the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information. This databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes, and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities."
"In the intestines, the microvilli are able to absorb (take) nutrients from the digested food for the body to use."
Languages of the United States
"English is the ""de facto"" national language of the United States, with 82% of the population claiming it as a mother tongue, and some 96% claiming to speak it ""well"" or ""very well"". However, no ""official language"" exists at the Federal level. There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills, but none of these bills have made a federal language. However, some states have adopted the English language as their official language. On the other hand, a lot of another languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hindi, Mandarin, Hebrew, Cantonese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Navajo, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Portuguese, etc. Are spoken in the United States as second languages."

"Khat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources are used for it because farmers get more money than for other cash crops. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. It uses so much water that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea."
"Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares."
Matsui Keishirō

National Capital Region (Canada)
"The National Capital Region () is an official federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The National Capital Region covers an area of 6,287.03 square kilometres (2,427.44 square miles). It has a population of 1,235,324. The Ottawa part of the region is part of the eastern subregion of Ontario. The Ottawa-Gatineau CMA is the only CMA in Canada to include parts of two provinces."
"The National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option."
"Cities, towns, and populations within Ottawa-Gatineau CMA."
"""Source:"" 2006 Census of Canada"
Other towns within National Capital Region.
"While not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa."
Gatineau
"Gatineau (as of 2006 census population 242,124) is a city in western Quebec, Canada. It is on the northern bank of the Ottawa River, immediately across from Ottawa, Ontario, within Canada's National Capital Region. Ottawa and Gatineau comprise a single Census Metropolitan Area."
Orientability
"In the Euclidean space, ""R3"" is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is chirality. This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable."
"Manzanillo, Colima"
Manzanillo is a city in Colima in Mexico. The city has the busiest port in Mexico.

The city has nearly 6 million people, who live in the metropolitan area. Caracas is the center of the economical activity of the country and also hosts the main government offices of Venezuela."
"After WW2 the city has experienced a huge growth, thanks to the oil revenues of the country. Nearly half a million Europeans immigrated to the city in the 1950s ( that had in those years only one million inhabitants) and so Caracas developed a typical western-European look in the new modern areas."
Sports.
All the best teams of the sports done in Venezuela are concentrated in the metropolitan area of Caracas. Between those teams we have:
Buildings.
Many beautiful modern buildings can be seen in the city. Here there are some of them:

Horst Köhler
"Horst Köhler (born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union. He was President of Germany from 2004 to 2010. He was the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the CDU and the CSU, and the liberal FDP, for becoming president. Köhler was elected to his first five-year term by the Federal Assembly on 23 May 2004. He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009. About one year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the Bundeswehr in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan."
"Köhler is an economist by profession. Prior to his election as president, Köhler had a career in politics, the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000. He also served as the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004."
"Although the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his term. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected. This was the case under Germany's Weimar Constitution."
Early life.
"Köhler was born in Skierbieszów (later named Heidenstein), in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland. He was the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler. His family were Bessarabian Germans from Rîşcani in Romanian Bessarabia (near Bălţi, present-day Moldova). Horst Köhler's parents had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940. As part of the Generalplan Ost, they were resettled in 1942 at Skierbieszów. This was a village near Zamość, Poland (then part of the General Government). When the Wehrmacht was pushed back during World War Two, the Köhler family fled to Leipzig. In 1953, they left the Soviet Zone to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in refugee camps until 1957. Then, they settled in Ludwigsburg. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee."
Studies and military service.
"A teacher proposed that the refugee boy should apply for the Gymnasium. Köhler took his ""Abitur"" in 1963. After a two-year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen, he left the Bundeswehr as reserve officer. He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from University of Tübingen. There, he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976."
Career in the civil service.
"Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellery of the state government in Schleswig-Holstein. He served there under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. In 1982, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance. He rose to head of department in 1987, with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests. In 1989, he became head of the department for currency and credit."
Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
"He is a member of the CDU since 1981. He was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993. In that capacity, he served as a ""sherpa"" (personal representative) for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing G7. He also served as the primary German negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations."
Career in banking 1993–2000.
"Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany. In 1998, he was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He settled in London, where the headquarters of the bank is located."
Head of the International Monetary Fund.
"Köhler was appointed managing Director and Chairman of the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2000. The government of Gerhard Schröder nominated him. This was because their first nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States."
"He lived in Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2004."
President of Germany.
"On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his positions, because he was nominated as presidential candidate. Köhler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580. 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. Köhler succeeded Johannes Rau as president on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term. Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office. However, it is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany. This was because Schloss Bellevue has been renovated."
"Upon his election, Köhler said that ""Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites"". Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that ""Germany should become a land of ideas""."
"In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's request. Schröder had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005."
"In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing a bill. It would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as president, Köhler was authorized to not sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006, he did not sign the Consumer Information Law, because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills. In most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history."
"In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector, stating that ""a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs""."
"On 22 May 2008, Köhler said, that he wants to be the candidate for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009, he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly, and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009."
"In November 2009, Köhler refused to sign the ""Zugangserschwerungsgesetz"" (Access Impediment Act) into law without further information. The law, which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography, is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional."
Resignation.
"On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:"
"He came under criticism for his statement that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade. He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position. After getting no support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010. He made a statement saying ""I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect."" The resignation was considered a ""surprise"". The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position."
"As written down in the German constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens Böhrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010."
Personal life.
"Horst Köhler is married to Eva Köhler, a teacher. They have two children, a daughter Ulrike (born in 1972) and a son Jochen (born in 1977). His daughter, who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, became blind as a teenager. Horst Köhler is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany."

Carter said that the 2016 election would ""define the US for a generation"". He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016."
"During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress, and did not support Trump for role during the national anthem protests."
"In September 2019, Carter said he would support an ""age-limit"" for presidential candidates."
"In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention."
Personal life.
"Carter and Rosalynn Smith were married on July 7, 1946 in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family. They have three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons."
Carter and his wife Rosalynn are well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.
"Carter's hobbies include painting, fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing. He also has an interest in poetry."
"Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta. The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had ""changed the face of American popular culture""."
"In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs."
"Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own. Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president. On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95."

Prytaneion
"The Prytaneion was a building at Olympia, Greece. It was here that feasts in honor of the Olympic victors and official guests were held in ancient times. The Prytaneion was built towards the end of the 6th century BC. It was located northwest of the Temple of Hera at Olympia. During Roman times (as evidenced by the many bricks), it was reconstructed and extended many times. The Altar of Hestia (the Greek virgin goddess of the hearth) was in the building. It was on this altar that the Olympic eternal flame burned day and night. Every year, Olympian priests would daub the Great Altar of Zeus with a mixture made from the ashes of the Altar of Hestia and the water of the River Alpheios. The Altar of Hestia was in a square room on the southern side of the building. The rooms on the west side and the peristyle court on the north side were used for feasting and cooking."
Elizabeth Arden
"Florence Nightingale Graham (31 December 1884 – 18 October 1966), better known as Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian–American business woman who founded what is now known as Elizabeth Arden, Incorporated. She built a cosmetics network in the United States. At the peak of her career, she became one of the richest women in the world. She was born near to Woodbridge in the Province of Ontario."
"The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle."
Geography.
"The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar."
"In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border."
"In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific."
"The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres."
"The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is deep."
Gulf Stream.
"The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents. One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic. Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole. This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole."
"There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa."
Geology.
"The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south."
The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.
Mercury
Mercury may mean:
Mercury (element)
"Mercury, also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum (pronounced hai-DRAR-jər-əm), is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. Its atomic mass is 200.59."
"The symbol ""Hg"" stands for its Latinized Greek name ""hydrargyrum"", meaning watery or liquid silver."
History.
No one has the credit for finding mercury. It was known in ancient times. Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that are from 2000 BC.
"Chinese people also knew it from long ago. In China and Tibet, people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health. One of China's emperors, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì, is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury. He died from drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever. However, this only made him die of liver failure, poisoning, and brain death. The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments. The Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics. These cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier."
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Mercury is a silvery-white liquid post-transition metal. The reason for mercury being a liquid is complex. It is heavy; a chunk of iron can float on mercury. Compared to other metals, it does not conduct heat well. However, it conducts electricity fairly well. Mercury is the only metal with a known melting point (−38.83 °C) lower than caesium. Mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure. Bromine is the other one."
"Mercury may be seen as a transition metal, but it is normally seen as a post-transition metal. It is in Group 12 of the periodic table. Mercury has seven stable (nonradioactive) isotopes. 202Hg is the most common isotope. Mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it. The ultraviolet light can kill germs or light fluorescent lamps."
Chemical properties.
"Mercury is an unreactive metal. It does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there, similar to silver. Mercury can oxidize to mercury(II) oxide when heated in air. If it is heated further, it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again. It does not dissolve in ordinary acids, but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts. It can make amalgams when mixed with most metals, like aluminium, gold, and zinc. Iron, tantalum, tungsten, and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury. Iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this."
"Mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal, making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers. The thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating (making an amalgam with) aluminium, but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal. Then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide. The aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury, which amalgamates more aluminium. This process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved."
Chemical compounds.
"Mercury forms chemical compounds in 2 oxidation states: +1 and +2. Mercury(I) compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents. Most of them are colorless. They easily disproportionate to mercury(II) compounds and mercury metal. They react with oxygen in the air to make mercury(II) compounds. Many mercury(I) compounds do not dissolve in water. Mercury(I) chloride is one of the most common mercury(I) compounds. Mercury(II) compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive. Mercury(II) compounds are red, yellow, or colorless. Mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) chloride are the most common mercury(II) compounds in the laboratory."
"In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency. During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal. Carter said that many places like ""Love Canals"" existed across the country. He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was ""one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era""."
"In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia."
Economy.
"Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president. He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession. His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth. In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs."
"The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose. Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down. There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis."
"Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed. The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety."
"In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States. This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s."
Healthcare.
"During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country."
"Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal, and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage. Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid. The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate, and later was not approved in the House."
"During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House. Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress."
Education.
"Carter worked with Congress to create an education department. In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments. On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department. On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education."
"Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families. In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas."
Foreign policies.
Peace treaties.
"In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty. The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999. This would remove United States control of the canal. The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal. The treaty was not popular with conservatives."
"In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David. The two agreements were signed at the White House. The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty."
Africa.
"Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries. Carter later said his plans for wanting ""to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe"" and to end racial issues like apartheid."
"Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country. He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria. Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia."
"On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia."
Iran hostage crisis.
"In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran."
"In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran. The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution. 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981. They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president. During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days. In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence. On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely. On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people."
Soviet Union.
"On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing. During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues. These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979."
"Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978. Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September. By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country. This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan. Carter was surprised by the invasion. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous. Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union. He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union. Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union. In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen. The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989."
South Korea.
"In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea. He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea. Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials. In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops. From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House."
1980 presidential election.
Democratic primary challenge.
"The night adders have very big venom glands, which are around 10 centimeters long. But even though the venom glands are big, the adders don't always use their venom on their prey. The venom would kill the prey fast enough, but they usually seize their prey and swallow it."
"When someone is bitten by a night adder, the venom does not spread around the body, and only causes swelling in the place of the bite. There have been no reports of deaths by night adder venom."
Common night adder
The common night adder is a species of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa.
Description.
"The common night adder can grow up to around 60 centimeters (24 in) long, making it the longest species of the genus ""Causus"". The longest ever recorded was a male found in eastern Zimbabwe which was 93 centimeters (around 37 in) long. They are usually olive green, brown, or grayish-brown in color with black rhombic-shaped blotches, but not all have blotches on them."
Common names.
"The common night adder is also called the ""rhombic night adder"", the ""demon night adder"", the ""Cape Viper"", and the ""African night adder""."
Where they live.
"The common night adder is found in the savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Nigeria, east to Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, south to Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, and eastern South Africa."
Behavior.
"The common night adder is a fairly fast species of snake; it can move at the speed of 3.3 km per hour. They are usually found on the ground, but they can climb trees and can swim. They are mainly nocturnal, but some have been seen basking in the early morning or late afternoon. When disturbed they coil up, inflate their body (which makes the black blotches on them stand out), and start hissing loudly."
"Common night adders are oviparous, meaning that they lay eggs, while other vipers are usually viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Females lay around two dozen eggs at a time, which take around four months to hatch. Once hatched, the young are 10 to 12.5 cm long and eat small frogs and toads."
Feeding.
"Their diet is made up of mainly frogs and toads, and sometimes small mammals like mice and rats."
Polystyrene
"Polystyrene is a form of chemical compound that is mainly used for a wide variety of packaging. It is an aromatic polymer made from the monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is manufactured from petroleum by the chemical industry. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale being several billion kilograms per year."
Polystyrene can be in either a thermoset or a thermoplastic form.
Allometry
"Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape. In particular, it refers to the rate of growth of one part of the body compared to other parts."
"In most cases, the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows. Most allometric relationships are adaptive. For example, organs which depend on their surface area (such as the intestine) grow faster as the body weight increases."
"Also, there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves. Allometry is an important way to describe changes in gross morphology (body shape) during evolution. Changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common. The trend is known as heterochrony."
"Allometry was first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917, and Julian Huxley in 1932. The relationship between two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law:"
or in a logarithmic form:
where formula_3 is the scaling exponent of the law.
On being the right size.
"J.B.S. Haldane's 1926 essay ""On being the right size"" gives an overview of the way size interacts with body structure. Haldane's thesis is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have:"
"Many of his examples are based on the square-cube law. If an animal's length is doubled, its surface area will be squared and its weight cubed. This alone causes allometric changes in any evolutionary lineage where successive species get larger or smaller. There are many such lineages."
"After the Cold War, Romania became closer friends with Western Europe. In 2004, Romania joined NATO and hosted the 2008 summit. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007."
Geography.
Romania is a part of southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea and the Danube River. The Carpathian Mountains lie in the center.
"Romania is the biggest country in southeast Europe by population. It has an area of . It is the twelfth-largest country in Europe. Most of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube joins the Prut River. The Prut River makes the Moldovan–Romanian border. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside Romania. This makes the Danube Delta. The delta is a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, the Olt, and the Mureş. The Siret River runs from the north to the south of Moldavia. The Olt River runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia. The Mureş runs through Transylvania from the east to the west."
Landscape.
"The land in Romania is made up of equal parts of mountains, hills, and low-lying areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. Fourteen of its mountain ranges are taller than . The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak, with a peak altitude of ."
Rivers.
The Danube is the longest river in Romania. Its length inside Romania is about . That is almost half of the length of the entire Danube. Almost all of the rivers in Romania are either direct or indirect tributaries of the Danube.
Weather.
Romania has a climate that changes between temperate and continental climates. The reason for the climate changes is because Romania is near the coast. Romania has four different seasons. The average temperature during the year is in southern Romania and in the northern part.
"Lots of rain and snow falls on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow. In the southern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow that falls is around ."
"The lowest temperature ever taken in Romania was , at Braşov in 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was , near Calafat in the 1950s."
Society.
These are the development regions of Romania:
Language and culture.
The official language of Romania is Romanian. The Romanian language is an Eastern Romance language.
"Romania has its own culture because of where it is found. It is the point where 3 different areas meet: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans. Romanian culture is a mix of all these areas. The culture of Romania was influenced by the Greeks, Romans, and Slavs."
Religion.
"Romania is a secular state. This means Romania has no national religion. The biggest religious group in Romania is the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is an autocephalous church inside of the Eastern Orthodox communion. In 2002, this religion made up 86.7% of the population. Other religions in Romania include Roman Catholicism (4.7%), Protestantism (3.7%), Pentecostalism (1.5%), Islam (1%) and the Romanian Greek-Catholicism (0.9%)."
Cities.
"Bucharest is the capital of Romania. It also is the biggest city in Romania, with a population of over 2 millions peoples."
"There are 5 other cities in Romania that have a population of more than 300,000 people. These are Iaşi, Cluj-Napoca, Timişoara, Constanţa, and Craiova. Romania also has 5 cities that have more than 200,000 people living in them: Galaţi, Braşov, Ploieşti, Brăila, and Oradea."
"Thirteen other cities in Romania have a population of more than 100,000 people."
Economy.
"Romania joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. Romania's economy is healthy. Currently, Romania makes around $350 billion in Gross domestic product and a GDP per capita of $16,540."
"Long into the 1900s, Romania was still a largely agricultural country. During Communism 1947-1989, the country had planned economy. The transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the 1990s, the reasons was that more money was printed, expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies, which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment. The reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in Romania. When it was going explosively good for the industry in the Latin countries such as France, Italy and Spain, these countries began to trade with Romania because it is favorite voice country for them to grow in. Foreign companies expanding in Romania since then, and spurs the market."
Education.
"The Romanian school is obligatory for 10 years. Children also have the opportunity to be part of a voluntary pre-school at an early age 3–6 years. After school, students can voluntarily take the entrance exam to high school, which has a range of practical and theoretical lines. There are over 40 higher educational institutions, including five universities and five technical colleges. Tuition is free and is a hot political commitment even at the university. The country's minorities have the opportunity to receive instruction in their native language. Since 1989, education has been reformed. But it has been slow and the standard of education varies greatly in different parts of the country, education has improved the standard of urban compared to rural areas where quality can be very low. Romania participates fully in the EU's education program."
Social welfare.
The unemployment rate in Romania is five per-cent and has been low for many years.
"The living standards were very low at the end of the Communist era, but the situation was just only improved a little bit during the 1990s. On the contrary, the living significantly due caused by the large privatization of jobs that resulted in high unemployment and rising prices. In later years lived yet 2010 nearly 10 percent of the population in absolute poverty and of these, 90% live in rural areas. The State social insurance system have relatively broad coverage but resources are extremely small."
"Reforms have been initiated and in 1999 the health insurance became privatized and paid by the employers and the employees. Several thousand local trade unions were founded after the revolution, which were later amalgamated (combined) into federations. These unions and federations have helped organise students, pensioners and the unemployed; because these groups of people all have similar needs, concerns and goals."

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the short title of an important book by the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon. The book traces the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire.
"Published in six volumes, from volume I in 1776 to volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 AD, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and its fall in the West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first ""modern historian of ancient Rome""."
Thesis.
Gibbon gave an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.
"According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because its citizens gradually lost their ""civic virtue"". They had become weak, using barbarian mercenaries to defend their Empire, who then became so numerous that they were able to take over the Empire."
"Romans, he believed, became unwilling to live the tougher, ""manly"" military lifestyle. In addition, Gibbon argued that Christianity created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered an indifference to the present among Roman citizens, and sapped their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its pacifism tended to hamper the traditional Roman martial spirit. Finally, like other Enlightenment thinkers, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, ""dark age"". It was not until his own age of reason and rational thought, so it was believed, that human history could resume its progress."
"Gibbon sees the Praetorian Guard as the main catalyst of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus at the start of the empire. He cites repeated examples of the Praetorian Guard abusing their power with calamitous results, including numerous instances of imperial assassination and incessant demands for increased pay."
Views on Christianity.
"In Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon challenged Church history. He estimated far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been previously thought. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. For Gibbon, however, the Church writings were secondary sources. He shunned them in favour of primary sources from the period he was writing about. This is one reason why Gibbon is referred to as the ""first modern historian""."
Gibbon's main theory was that Christianity as a prime factor in the Empire's decline and fall.
"And, more generally:"
"Later historians have mostly not agreed with Gibbon. Today, historians tend to analyze economic and military factors in the decline of Rome."
Editions.
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.
Aminul Islam (poet)
Aminul Islam (born 29 December 1963) is a poet and essayist. He is from Bangladesh. Aminul has written seventeen books. He written thirteen poetry books. He has been involved in creative writing for 20 years.
Aminul Islam (trade unionist)
Aminul Islam (1973 – April 2012) was a Bangladeshi trade unionist (someone who organises trade unions). He was murdered in 2012.
Work.
Islam was a former garment worker and was president of the Ashulia and Savar Bangladesh Garment &amp; Industrial Workers Federation.
"Also he was the leader of Bangladesh Center of Worker Solidarity. It has advocated for improved working conditions and higher wages. In 2010, the organization led protested to push for a larger increase in the minimum wage for garment workers. Islam and other protester were arrested for that."
"Islam had recently been working to organize workers in factories, which belonged to the Shanta Group. The company produces clothing for multiple American companies, like Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Ralph Lauren. He had also assisted ABC News, for an interview with the survivors of a recent factory fire in Bangladesh."
"As President, Roosevelt worked to make the U.S. a world power, one of the most powerful countries in the world. Before, it had been the richest country in the world, but not a significant military power. Roosevelt's foreign policy was described by an African proverb as ""speak softly and carry a big stick"", meaning you do not have to make war, but should give that impression if you are to be respected. He increased the size of the United States' navy and sent all of the ships across the world to demonstrate to other countries that the United States was strong and could fight if needs be."
"He continued the Monroe Doctrine and used the country's military might to influence Latin American politics. He had the Panama Canal built (which allowed ships to travel in less time by taking a shortcut). In doing so, he created the independent country of Panama, which before was part of Colombia, by invading it. He also took a part for the United States, which is where the canal was built. It was not turned over to Panama until 1999. As president, he was interested in what happened in other countries. In 1905, he helped to end the war between the Russian and Japanese empires. Everybody thought Russia would defeat Japan, but the result was the opposite. Roosevelt met both parties and convinced them to sign a peace treaty. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for this work in 1906. He was the first president of any country to win the prize."
"At home, Roosevelt fought for all Americans having a ""Square Deal"", meaning an equal chance for all Americans to become successful. As part of his Square Deal, he regulated big businesses called trusts, and forced several of them to split up in several smaller companies. This should support competition, which he thought was important. Roosevelt supported labor laws for the working class, required meat and drugs to be inspected, and protected the environment. He created several nature reserves. These ideas would influence later presidents to expand the government's role in the economy and to help ordinary workers. Many in the Republican party opposed him because of this, however."
After being president.
"Roosevelt did not run for president in 1908, as he had the office for nearly eight years. He wanted his Solicitor General, William Howard Taft to run for president instead. Taft was chosen, and Roosevelt went to Africa to hunt big game. However, when he came back, he thought Taft was not doing a good job and taking too little actions against so-called trusts. Taft was also more conservative and he did not continue all of Roosevelt's progressive policies. He decided to challenge Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912. He failed, but many Republicans preferred Roosevelt, and instead he launched his own party, the Progressive party. While running for president and holding a speech, he was shot, but lived and even finished his speech. Because the Republican voters split between Roosevelt and Taft, they both lost to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt also thought Wilson was not doing a good job, either, and wanted the U.S. to enter World War I after it broke out. He prepared to run again, for the third time, in 1920. Nobody had served more than eight years at the time. Roosevelt died, however, on January 6, 1919 of a pulmonary embolism and a heart attack in his sleep. Because he was so strong, a newspaper commented that ""death had to take Roosevelt asleep"", because if he had been awake there would have been a fight between him and death."
Other Information.
"Besides being president, Roosevelt was an author and historian. He wrote 35 books about politics, ships, and hunting. He is thought to be one of America's presidents who read the most. He owned a large ranch in North Dakota. He also hunted large animals throughout the world and was active with the Boy Scouts of America."
Legacy.
Roosevelt is one of four Presidents to be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore. Historians consider him one of the best U.S. presidents.
Namesake.
"Theodore Roosevelt is the namesake of many American schools. He has a national park in North Dakota named after him, a type of elk (big deer), as well as river in Brazil. The popular stuffed animal doll, the ""Teddy bear"", was named after Roosevelt."
Two US Navy ships are named after him:

Notes
Composer
"A composer is someone who writes (composes) music. Some composers work by writing music down on paper; this is called 'written notation'. Classical music writers work this way. Writers for TV and movie music also usually write this way, so that an orchestra or other players can read the music and play it."
"Some musicians are very good at improvisation. This means that they think up (invent) the music as they play it. Some church organists are good at improvising. During a service they may need to play some organ music to fill in the gaps while people are collecting money or taking communion. Jazz musicians are usually excellent at improvising. Improvisation is not written down, so each time it is different."
Popular and rock or soul music writers are often not able to read and write music down. Many pop and rock composers compose their songs on a guitar or piano. Cole Porter and Irving Berlin usually composed at the piano.
"Many songs are written by two or more people. It is common for two people to work together to write songs. Sometimes, one person writes the music and one writes the words (the lyrics). Some songs such as folk songs were composed many years ago and no one knows who wrote them."
Cannes Film Festival
"The Cannes Film Festival is an event held every year in Cannes, France. The festival previews films from around the world."
Only those who are invited can attend the festival. The top film wins the Palme d'Or. The second most prestigious trophy is the Grand Prix. A jury selects which film earns the prizes. The jury is led by an internationally recognized personality of cinema. Being appointed to this position is the recognition of an outstanding career.

Henry VIII
"Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547) was the King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547. He is perhaps one of England's most famous monarchs because he split England from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope, and because he married six times."
"Henry VIII increased the power of the monarchy and government over the country. Many people he did not like were executed under his orders, including two of his own wives. He was easily led by whoever his favourite advisor was: Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer and Richard Rich. More and Cromwell were also executed. He passed laws to merge Wales into England and was the first English monarch to be King of Ireland."
"Moore is also a cast member of the 2016 American dramedy series ""This Is Us""."
Oiran
"were courtesans in Japan. Oiran were part of Japanese society during the Edo Period, (1600–1868). Prostitution was legal then, but only in special neighborhoods that were closed to outsiders. There were different kinds of oiran, depending on their beauty, skills in art, education, and more. High-ranking oiran were called . Only nobles could be with one. Tayū had many servants, and when they went outside, their servants carried them and followed them, making a procession. They wore very expensive clothes and jewelry. Any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette."
Geisha replaced oiran. Geisha practiced common types of entertainment enjoyed by the people of that time. They became more popular than oiran. The last known oiran was in 1761. A few women still practice the arts of the oiran today (without sex) to continue the cultural heritage.
Ryōtei
"A is a type of very expensive and elegant Japanese restaurant. Traditionally they only accept new customers who are recommended by known and trusted clients. They usually include entertainment by geisha, but not always in modern times. Ryōtei are usually a place where very important business or political meetings can take place in private."
Philharmonia
The Philharmonia is an orchestra from London.
History.
"The orchestra was formed in 1945 by Walter Legge. Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies."
"In 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life."
"In 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the ""New Philharmonia Orchestra"". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9"", conducted by Klemperer."
"The orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since."
"Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008."
Concerts Today.
"Today, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam."
Recordings.
"The Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"", and David Lean's film version of ""Oliver Twist"" (1948)."
Taiko
"means simply ""drum"" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is used to refer to any of the different kinds of Japanese drums (, ""wadaiko"", ""Japanese drum"" in Japanese) and to the more or less new art of taiko drumming bands (sometimes better called, ""kumi-daiko"", ). The taiko drum originated in the country of Japan. This drum was created by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. The taiko drum makes a very loud, deep sound."
"In a traditional Japanese village the ""odaiko"" (big drum) defined the extent of the village land. In modern Japan, wadaiko has become more of a performance art, seen only during festivals or in concert. The most famous Wadaiko performance group are 'Kodo' (meaning heart-beat). They are not only the worlds most respected Japanese drumming group, they also maintain many traditional art forms. They group lives on the island 'Sado Higashima' and live together as a community in a traditional way. Many other cultures have adopted this style of drumming, from Germany and the United States to Australia."
Kitagawa Utamaro
"Kitagawa Utamaro (;  – 31 October 1806), also called Utamaro, was a Japanese artist. He was a master of the ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting."
Career.
"Utamaro is known for his studies of women (""bijinga""). He also made nature studies."
His work was popular in Europe. He influenced artists in Europe who were called Impressionists.

Rocket engine
"A rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle. Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion. In some cases (such as NASA rockets), the force created can be over ."
A garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force. When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still. The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine.
"Liquids, solids and hybrids."
"Some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels. Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called ""rocket motors""."
"Liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move (and pressurize) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine. These machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures. Liquid oxygen is very cold (-223˚C) while the engine is very hot (3000˚C), and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure. Because of these conditions, liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials (metals, ceramics, etc.)."
"Solid fuel rocket motors have the fuel (called propellant) as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel. An oxidizer supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning. The common oxidizer is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate, while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal. The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder. The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel. The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper, but they cannot be turned off or controlled, and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines. Solid rockets also provide a smaller specific impulse, hence must be heavier to launch the same payload."
"Military missiles commonly use solid rockets because they can be kept ready for many years. Many satellite launchers use solid rocket boosters when they start, but liquid rockets for the majority of the flight."
"Hybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas. The two propellants are different states of matter, often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels. They are not used much, but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors"
Nozzle
A nozzle is a device that takes incoming fluid (such as gas or liquid) and increases the speed. This is done by changing the size of the pipe (or tube) that the fluid is flowing through.

Penny Black
"The Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. It was issued by the United Kingdom on the 1 May 1840 and used from the 6 May the same year. All London post offices received official issues of the new stamps, but other offices in the country did not. Some post offices like in Bath, offered the stamp unofficially after 2 May."
"Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show or simply just Dr. Hook was an American band. They formed in Union City, New Jersey in 1968. Their two best known songs were ""Cover of the Rolling Stone"" and ""Sylvia's Mother""."
Glider
"Gliders are aircrafts which do not have a motor. Gliders are controlled by their pilots by using control-sticks. Some gliders can only carry one person; others can carry two. In gliders with two seats, each pilot has a control-stick. Gliders always have seats for the pilots."
'Sailplanes' are gliders with long wings so that they will only lose height slowly. In some places a vertical draft makes the air go up faster than the glider is going down. The pilot of a glider can make it climb by flying to these places. This is called soaring. Good pilots can travel long distances by always finding rising air. Some pilots race each other over hundreds of kilometres each day. Other pilots just fly for fun.
Gliders cannot get into the air by themselves. They are pulled into the air by an aircraft with a motor or they are pulled up by motor on the ground.
"There are two other types of gliders. Hang-gliders have frames to give the wings their shape, but do not have seats for their pilots and do not have control-sticks. The wings of paragliders are like parachutes and so do not have frames to give them their shape. These other two types of glider are often launched from the tops of hills or cliffs."
John Stuart Mill
"John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873) was an English philosopher and political economist. He was a classical liberal thinker of the 19th century. He was for utilitarianism, the ethical theory first proposed by his third godfather Jeremy Bentham."
"As a utilitarian, he believed that the good of society as a whole is more important than the pleasure of one or a few individuals."
Jeremy Bentham
"Jeremy Bentham (15 February 1748 – 6 June 1832) was an English, jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He is best known as one of the first people to be for utilitarianism and animal rights and gay rights."
"Bentham was one of the most influential (classical) liberals, partially through his writings but particularly through his students all around the world, including John Stuart Mill and several political leaders (and Robert Owen, who later started the idea of socialism). He is believed to be the innovator of classical liberalism, a term first coined in the 19th century. After he died, his body was preserved and is on public display at University College London to this day."

"Dinosaur Comics is a comic by Ryan North. It shows dinosaurs who have adventures and talk about philosophy and some other topics. The art is the same every day, but the words are different. This comic is intended to be funny."
Things in the comic that are not true:
Lucid dream
"A lucid dream is essentially a dream in which the person is aware that he is in the dream. In a lucid dream, the person does not have to be in control of his surroundings for the dream to be lucid, and only being aware of the dream itself is sufficient condition for the dream to be described as lucid."
"The art of lucid dreaming is the art of being able to control your surroundings in the dream itself. People who lucid dream can usually control everything that happens in their dream. They can teleport, fly, make something appear, or even make everything disappear. Regular lucid dreamers usually do so for spiritual reasons but there certainly are people who do it for fun or to avoid bad dreams."
Ways to lucid dream.
"Although some people can have lucid dreams without trying, most people do not have them often. It is important to be able to remember dreams, because if the dreamer does not remember them, he or she will not know if they were lucid dreams or not. Remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up."
"There are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely. Stephen LaBerge, a psychologist who studies lucid dreams, made the MILD (mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming) technique. To do this, the dreamer must wake up after having a dream, and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again, except now knowing it is a dream. The dreamer should think ""the next time I am dreaming, I want to remember I am dreaming"", and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep."
There are many other ways to help someone lucid dream. One other way is to fall asleep while keeping the mind awake. This is called the WILD (wake induced lucid dreaming) technique. It is easiest to perform after waking up from a few hours of sleep.
My Fair Lady
"My Fair Lady is a musical. It is based on George Bernard Shaw's play, ""Pygmalion"", and on the movie adaptation of the play starring Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard. The book and lyrics for the musical were written by Alan Jay Lerner. The music was written by Frederick Loewe."
Synopsis.
"The common flower girl, ""Eliza Doolittle"", tells us of the simple pleasures she would like in life (a warm room, an enormous chair, chocolate, someone who cares for her) and how much she would appreciate these little things. As Eliza grew up on the streets of London, she has a strong cockney accent (therefore pronouncing ‘lovely’ as ‘loverly’), the phoneticist, ""Professor Henry Higgins"", overhears her and he places a bet that he can turn Eliza into a lady within the space of a year."

Invention
"An invention is a new thing that someone has made. The computer was an invention when it was first made. We say when it was ""invented"". New things that are made or created are called inventions. Cars and plastics are inventions that everyone knows. Inventions are made by inventors. Many inventions are patented."
"Ideas are also called inventions. Writers can invent characters, and then invent a story about them."
Inventing.
"Over time, humans have invented objects which make life easier for themselves. Because of this, a quote ""necessity is the mother of invention"", was written. The quote means that a lack of something should inspire someone to create something to fill that empty space. However, not all people believe that this is true. They think that too much of something can lead to an invention."
Many inventions are just a variation of something that already exists.
Genocide
"Genocide is the crime of killing many people who are all part of one ethnic or religious group, or some sort of similar group, and trying to destroy that group. Genocide is done usually by a group, such as a government, or military group, not by one person or a small number of people. Usually, the motivation for genocide is based on political reason."
"The word genocide was made up by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew, in 1944, from the words ""genos"" (Greek for family, tribe or race) and ""-cide"" (from the Latin ""occidere"", to kill). It was first used to the Nazi Holocaust, when many groups, including Jews and others, were killed."
Ustashe of Croatia are another example of genocidial horror. About a million of Serbs were killed in WWII in Ustashe concentration camps especially in Jasenovac. Another example of genocide was when about a million of the Tutsi group of people of Rwanda were killed along with Hutus who were against the genocide in 1994.
"In 1933 Lemkin made a speech to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay on the ""Crime of Barbarity"" as a crime against international law. The purpose of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based mostly on the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq on 11 August 1933. The event in Iraq reminded him of earlier similar events of the Armenian Genocide during World War I."
"Today, any genocide is prohibited by the Genocide Convention and actor or inciter of genocide is judged by the International Criminal Court."
Examples.
Today most people see the following events as genocide. Note that the events listed are just examples.
Yoko Ono
"is a Japanese musician and artist. She is the widow of John Lennon. Before she married Lennon she was married to Toshi Ichiyanagi from 1956 to 1963 and Anthony Cox from 1963 to 1969. She has two children, Kyoko Chan Cox (with Cox) and Sean Lennon (with Lennon)."
Early life.
"Both of her parents came from wealthy families. Her father, who was a descendant of a former Emperor of Japan, had been a concert pianist before giving up music to become a banker. Ono was tutored privately, then sent to exclusive private schools, studying classical music and art, and also learning English. She visited the United States before World War II with her family. Her father was on a business trip to the U.S. when the war began, and was with many other Japanese in the country. He was not able to communicate with his family for many years. Ono's mother took her, her brother and sister away from Tokyo, and they stayed in a rural area."
"After the war ended, the family was reunited, and moved to New York for her father's job. Ono enrolled in Sarah Lawrence College, but quit during her third year. She became interested in art and music, and began writing poetry. Many of her poems were instructions, for creating pieces of art. She later published some of these in a book, titled ""Grapefruit"". Her parents were not happy that Ono chose to make her own way, rather than following her family's wishes for her life. When she married Toshi Ichiyanagi, a young pianist, her parents her."
"The marriage did not work out, and Ono rented a loft apartment of her own. She became friends with local artists in New York, including Andy Warhol and a group called Fluxus. She hosted small parties and ""happenings"" for her artist friends, and began to do artwork of her own. This brought her some notoriety in time, but not fame. She remarried, to Tony (Anthony) Cox, and they had a daughter, named Kyoko."
Marriage to Lennon.
"Ono went to London with Cox and Kyoko during 1966, to promote her career as an artist. John Lennon, who was a member of The Beatles, went to one of her art shows. He enjoyed the (fantasy-like) quality of her work. Ono and Lennon became friends, and later lovers, as each lost interest in their spouses. Lennon wanted them to be together as much as possible. He broke a rule the Beatles had never to bring a wife or girlfriend to their recording sessions. He brought her along anytime he could. They were married in March 1969, after they were both divorced."
"Many Beatles fans blamed Ono for ""breaking up"" the band through her influence on Lennon. He seemed to many people to have ""gone crazy"" since meeting her. Some suggest that Ono simply encouraged Lennon to do things he'd already wanted to do, but let himself be talked out of doing in the past – including quitting the Beatles. Ono and Lennon started a new, part-time group they called the Plastic Ono Band. They also tried to have a baby together. Ono miscarried several times, until their son Sean Lennon was born in 1975, on Lennon's 35th birthday. Ono was also able to with her family, during the 1970s."
"Ono was Lennon's ""muse"", inspiring his music and his creative side, for the rest of his life. The two worked together on both his post-Beatles records, and Ono's wish to also have a music career. She was more interested in ""experimental"" music than in classical or popular music. Ono's songs and unique style sounded strange to most listeners. It was offensive to many people, who thought Lennon should have either stayed with the Beatles, or made more music in their style. Ono changed her style, and began to write and record more pop songs, but her music never became popular. Years later, some younger musicians (such as The B-52's) admitted they had liked Ono's music. They were inspired by it, as Lennon had been."
Since 1980s.
"After Lennon's murderer in 1980, Ono recorded several solo albums. The first was titled ""Season of Glass"". Her later records were praised by some music critics."
"When Sean Lennon grew up, he also became a musician. He helped Ono to compile (collect and put in order) her old recordings, and make some new ones. She also revived some of her earlier artwork, and gave the money made from sales and exhibits to charities. Ono recently (2006) appeared at the opening of ""Love"", a Cirque du Soleil show featuring Beatles music, to help promote it."

Barrick Gold
Queen Esther discovered the plot by Haman and worked to stop it. She invited the king to dine with Haman present so she could tell him about the plot. But her courage failed her and she said nothing.
"She again invited King Ahaseurus and Haman to dine and this time she told the king of Haman's plot. The king, furious, stormed out and Haman begged Esther for mercy. When the king returned, he mistakenly believed Haman had molested his queen, and had him hanged on the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. In the end, thanks to Esther's courage and influence, the king changed the law and saved the Jewish people."
Clay
"Clay is a fine-grained silicate mineral made when rocks break down. Wet clay is soft and can be shaped to make pottery, bricks and other things. When it is shaped and then fired in a kiln to make it hard, it becomes pottery."
Clay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains. There may also be some organic materials in the clay.
"There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). The thixotropy of clay sometimes causes landslides."
"Quartz, feldspars, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral. The formation of clay is well understood. It can come from soil, volcanic ash, and glaciation. Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily."
"Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. A clay particle is about 1/1000th the width of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement. Where the grains are more than a few millimeters wide, the material is called silt, not clay."
Rifle
The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves. The grooves are called rifling and make bullets spin as they fly through the air. Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of bullets using different amounts of gunpowder. Rifles are usually made to be able to hit targets at long ranges. Modern rifles are made for many different purposes. Some are made for hunting animals. Some are made for soldiers to use in war. Others are made for police to have in case they need them. Some rifles are made for target shooting.
Types.
"Rifles can work in different ways. Some rifles have what is called a bolt action. A small handle is used to move a part of the rifle called a ""bolt"". By moving the bolt backward, then forward, allows the shooter put a bullet in the chamber ready for firing. It also ejects any spent shells still in the chamber from any previously fired rounds. The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some rifles are semi-automatics, where a bullet is loaded (automatically) and fired each time the trigger is pulled. Some are fully automatic, which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger. The automatic rifle stops firing when the trigger is released or it runs out of ammunition."
Deuterocanonical books
"[WARNING, THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN ERRORS]Deuterocanonical books means ""second canon"" in Greek. It usually means the parts of the Bible that are only used by some Christian churches (mostly Roman Catholic and Orthodox). The books only exist in Greek language manuscripts that were written by the Jewish people living in Greek speaking areas of the Mediterranean Sea between 250 and 50 BC, as were all of the books of the Old Testament. It was not until circa 900 AD that the Old Testament as known in Jewish and Protestant religions was written in Hebrew and limited to the current so-called ""canons"".[citation needed, see dead sea scrolls]"
"The books are not part of the Jewish Tanakh (also called the ""Hebrew Bible""), although they were quoted as Scripture well into the Middle Ages as is found in the Jewish Mishna and later Rabbinical writings, even into the 6th century AD. The current Jewish canon was closed by the time of the Masoretic Text in the 10th century AD."
Some books considered deuterocanonical by Catholics are:
"The ""Book of Daniel"" and the ""Book of Esther"" are longer in Catholic Bibles than in Protestant Bibles because they have more stories."
"Many, but not all Protestant churches do not accept these books as inspired by God and use the derogatory term for them: Apocrypha. Martin Luther considered these books good to read while John Calvin read and studied them but did not think they should be part of the Bible. The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church,"

Sidekick
"A sidekick is someone who regularly travels with, and helps, another person. In fiction, the other person is often a crimefighter or superhero, such as Batman and his sidekick Robin. Some people consider Sancho Panza, Don Quixote's ever-faithful companion, to be a type of sidekick, even though the book was written long before the word sidekick was invented. Annabeth Chase is nobody's sidekick."
Jurist
A jurist (from medieval Latin) is someone who researches and studies jurisprudence (theory of law).

Messianic Judaism
"Messianic Judaism is a movement of Jews who believe that Jesus (called by them with his Hebrew name ""Yeshua"") is the Jewish Messiah, and who perform this belief in a Jewish way (observing the regulations of the Torah etc.). They are called ""Messianic Jews"". The main branches of Judaism do not consider Messianic Judaism to be Judaism, but rather a form of Christianity, because Judaism rejects Jesus/Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah."
Malcolm Sargent
"Sir Malcolm Sargent (born Ashford, Kent, 29 April 1895; died London 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer. He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public."
Life.
Early years.
"Sargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham."
"After conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition ""Impressions on a Windy Day"" with Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children’s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death."
"Illness, and mid career."
"In 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera ""Louise"" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's ""Troilus and Cressida""."
"As an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure “job for life” but should give their “lifeblood with every bar they played”. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this."
"He was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 7"" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's ""Dream of Gerontius"" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen’s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb."
"In 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music."
The Proms and later years.
Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.
"Sargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music."
"During his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras."
"When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again."
"By the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone’s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later."
Achievement and reputation.
"Sargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was “Flash Harry” because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as “Britain’s ambassador of music”, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders"
Playoffs
"The playoffs, postseason, or finals are a series of games played after the regular season of a particular sports league. They are played by the most successful teams of the season. It is used to determine the season's champion. The teams that play in the playoffs are the ones with the most wins or points during the regular season."
"Playoffs are usually, but not always, done with a single-elimination system."
Lars
Lars is a male name. It is usually used in Scandinavian countries and Germany.
"Lars comes from the Roman name ""Laurentius""."
Some famous people named Lars are:
Spenserian stanza
"The Spenserian stanza is a fixed verse form invented by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem ""The Faerie Queene"". Each stanza contains nine lines in total. The first eight lines are in iambic pentameter, that is consist of ten syllables, followed by a single alexandrine line in iambic hexameter, that is are made up of twelve syllables. The rhyme scheme of these lines is ""a-b-a-b-b-c-b-c-c."""
"Many poets used the stanza after Spenser, for example Lord Byron (Chlide Harold's Pilgrimage), Percy Bysshe Shelley (Adonais), John Keats (The Eve of St. Agnes) and Alfred Tennyson (The Lotos-Eaters). Spenserian stanza remained a typical English form and it was never much popular outside England. Only few poets employed it in Central Europe, for example Juliusz Słowacki, Jan Kasprowicz and Jaroslav Vrchlický."
Biotti
Biotti is an Italian surname. Notable people with the surname include:
African fish eagle
"The African fish eagle (""Haliaeetus vocifer"") or the African sea eagle is a large species of eagle."
"It is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa where there are large bodies of open water with plenty of fish. It is the national bird of Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Sudan."
"This species looks a bit like the bald eagle. They are related, but live on different continents. The bald eagle lives in North America."
Caracol Televisión
"Caracol Televisión is the most viewed national television network in Colombia, founded in 1969 and Caracol Internacional (television channel)."
The Grupo Santodomingo is the Caracol Televisión's (or Canal Caracol) main actionist.
Fatima Naoot
"Fatima Naoot (Arabic: فاطمة ناعوت ) (born September 18, 1964) is an Egyptian writer and poet. In January 2016, the Egyptian government sentenced Naoot to jail for 3 years after she wrote on Facebook about killing sheep for the Eid holiday."
Work.
Naoot was a candidate for the Egyptian parliament.
Naoot wrote several books of poetry and a book of poetry analysis. She also translated collections of poems from English into Arabic.
Insulting religion.
"Fatima Naoot always seeks for freedom without any authority even if this authority will belong to any religion. In October she published a post on Facebook was describing ""the Eid Al-Adha’s tradition of slaughtering sheep as the “greatest massacre committed by human beings.” Then one candidate from parliament said that ""Her aim is to insult Islam"". Thus she wrote through Ahram Online report ""that humans justified their lust for killing and enjoying the smell of cooking game by attempting to bestow a divine meaning to their actions.” And because of the law that added in 1982 a legislation which stated that there is from six months to five years and fines of LE500 to LE1000 for anyone who uses religion to promote, through speech, writing, or any other medium, extremist ideas with the aim of spreading discord or to belittle one of the monotheistic religions or their different sects, or to harm national unity. she put in jail for 3 years and fined 20.000 LE. Although she said in front of the court that ""she did not aim to insult Islam, but she just explained her point of view. Naoot said through Middle east online ""I’m not sad about the sentencing as I don’t care about going to jail. I’m sad that the efforts of reformists have been wasted,”. As a result, THE ARAB NETWORK FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INFORMATION issued a statement which is ""“the recent surge in the prosecution of opinion makers comes in conjunction with a fierce security campaign launched by security bodies against freedom of opinion and expression, with the aim of narrowing the overall climate of freedom of opinion and expression. Such a matter, in turn, makes Egypt one of the most Arab countries that show hostility to freedom of expression as well as press freedom, especially that about 59 journalists have remained in prison so far.” Fatma is not a political figure, she is an Egyptian writer, poet, translator and journalist who always says her point of view."

Ecology.
"Guadarrama National Park has eleven different types of places for plants and animals to live (ecologies). More than 1,280 species of animals live in the park. Thirteen of them are endangered. There are more than 1,500 types of plants that come from the area. There are more than 30 types of vegetation."
Shita-kiri Suzume
"Shita-kiri Suzume (which means ""The Tongue-Cut Sparrow"") is a Japanese folk legend. It is told by many parents to their children. The story is about being kind and helping someone who is hurt. It is also about being mean and greedy."
British Rail Class 458
"The South West Trains Class 458 (or 4JOP) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1998 and 2000. These units are part of Alstom's ""Juniper"" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 460."
British Rail Class 460
"The British Rail Class 460 (or 8Gat) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1999 and 2001. These units were part of Alstom's ""Juniper"" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 458."
All have since been converted to Class 458/5 units (other than four surplus driving vehicles used as spares donors) for operation by South Western Railway.
Domitian
"Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a Roman emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96."
Biography.
"Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father Vespasian (69–79), his elder brother Titus (79–81), and that of Domitian himself."
"When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius."
"As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome."
"Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus."
"Domitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate."
"Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant."
"Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century."
British Rail Class 465
"The British Rail Class 465 ""Networker"" electric multiple units were built by Metro Cammell and BREL between 1991 and 1993, and by ABB Rail between 1993 and 1994. They were brought into service from 1991 onwards. They are mostly used on suburban routes serving the South East of England, now operated by Southeastern."

Dacian Wars can be either of two wars by the Roman Empire along its Danube River against the north bank kingdom of Dacia and the Dacian king Decebalus:
British Rail Class 466
"The Class 466 750V DC third rail electric multiple unit (EMU) is a suburban EMU, which operates with Class 465 EMUs in southeast London and Kent on the Southeastern network. It is a member of the Networker family of trains."
London Underground 1992 Stock
The 1992 Tube Stock is the type of train used on the Central line and Waterloo &amp; City line of the London Underground. The trains were built by BREL (later Adtranz and now Bombardier Transportation). They were built after three 1986 tube stock prototype trains were tested to find out what the public wanted on the new trains.
Carol I of Romania
"Carol I of Romania, original name Prince Karl Eitel Friedrich Zephyrinus Ludwig of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, later simply of Hohenzollern (20 April 1839 - ), German prince, was elected Domnitor (Prince) of Romania on 20 April 1866, following the overthrow of Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He reigned in 1881 in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 . He died in October 1914 during World War 1 just after Austria-Hungary and Germany declared war on Serbia , Russia and France in August 1914"
"Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack."
Production.
"Filming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge."
"The production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded."
Reception.
"The film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an ""ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone."""
"Philip French called it an ""ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script."""
"""Time Out"" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote ""there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire’s first film since ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis""; the film at times seems like a ""study of guilt and grief"" and at other times a ""conspiracy thriller"" but ""ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film’s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character."""

Escape Room 2
"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a 2021 psychological horror movie directed by Adam Robitel. The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie ""Escape Room""."
Plot.
"After escaping the ""sole survivor"" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City–based headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying."
"The pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the ""winners"" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain."
"The next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before."
The next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.
"Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die."
"The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down."
"An Electro-optic modulator is an optical device. It is made of a material that has a so-called ""electro-optical effect"". This means that the material changes its optical properties when there is an electric field. One example is then when there is no electricity, light can pass through, and when there is, it cannot, and is reflected."
Liquid crystal
"Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid, but that show certain properties of a solid crystal. A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image."
"The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase)."
Liquid crystal displays use the optical properties of liquid crystals to control light.
Turing complete
"Turing complete is a term used in computability theory to describe abstract machines, usually called automata. Such an automaton is Turing complete, if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine. It is also called computationally universal."
"Most modern programming languages are Turing-complete. There are languages that are used to classify and describe the contents of documents; for example HTML. HTML is not Turing complete, because it cannot actively change the state of the system. HTML can be combined with a technology such as JavaScript; both together can be made Turing complete. The standard regular expressions, which most programming languages use, are not Turing complete either. Most regular expression engines have been adapted to include back-references. The problem with this is that a finite automaton cannot handle back references."
River Trent
The River Trent is one of the major rivers of England. It is the third longest river in the United Kingdom. It starts in Staffordshire. It flows through the centre of England until it joins the River Ouse to form the River Humber (estuary) which empties into the North Sea.
"The name ""Trent"" comes from a Celtic word possibly meaning ""strongly flooding"". More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Celtic words, ""tros"" (""over"") and ""hynt"" (""way"")."
"It is unusual amongst English rivers in that it flows north (for the second half of its route), and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore, the ""Aegir"". The area drained by the river includes most of the northern Midlands."
Navigation.
"The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However, for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself."
Trent Aegir.
"At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to high."
Kirkcudbrightshire
Kirkcudbrightshire is a Scottish county on the Solway Firth in the south-west of Scotland.
Its county town is Kirkcudbright.
"Kirkcudbrightshire was known by other names in the past: East Galloway because it is the eastern part of the old Kingdom of Galloway, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, because it was once governed by a steward employed by the Lord of Galloway and not a sheriff appointed by the king."
"Kirkcudbrightshire is named after the town of Kirkcudbright, which means ""Cuthbert's church""."
Villages.
"For local government, the county is in the Dumfries and Galloway council area."

Supports.
Equity premium puzzle.
"Equity premium puzzle(EPP) refers to the problem of why there is a big difference between returns in stocks and risk-free investments historically. Since stocks are much riskier than government bonds, the underinvestment in stocks relative to bonds supports the idea of loss aversion theory. Specifically, it's the myopic loss aversion introduced by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler, which indicates the behavioural characteristics of ""loss aversion"" and ""frequent evaluations"" of investors. Benartzi and Thaler argue that loss-averse investors are more willing to take risks if they do not evaluate the performance of their investments frequently. In their model, investors are unwilling to accept return variability and tend to take a short-term view of their wealth."
Demand elasticity.
"Demand is more elastic for price increases than price decreases, based on the assumption that the price increase is a loss while the price decrease is a gain for consumers."
Daniel Kahneman's contributions.
Prospect theory.
"Based on the principle of loss aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky developed prospect theory to explain how consumers make decisions in uncertain situations. Unlike the hypothesis of rational man use in economics, prospect theory reveals the irrational psychological factors that affect the choice behaviour. Most people are unwilling to take risks when facing gains but become risk-seeking in losses."
Endowment effect.
"Loss aversion theory explains the endowment effect. The endowment effect refers to the finding that once an individual owns a good, he/she tends to naturally place more value than he did before he didn't own it. Due to the asymmetric responses to losses and gains in the decision-making process, the consideration of ""loss avoidance"" is far greater than that of ""gain seeking,"" so people value more on a good they own."
Real world applications: Marketing Strategy.
"By using the loss aversion theory as a marketing strategy, firms are able to gain higher profits by changing consumers' behaviours. For example:"

It started in 31 December 1961 and was called ""Telefís Éireann"". It was the first TV channel in Ireland. It was called ""RTÉ"" from 1966, and ""RTÉ 1"" from 1978 when RTÉ 2 started. The channel was only in black and white between 1961 and 1968. From 1968, some programmes were broadcast in PAL colour."
"Some of the money for the channel comes from a government television licence, and the rest comes from advertisements. RTÉ channels have fewer advertisements than other channels because of this. RTÉ One can be watched by 98% of people in Ireland in HD on the Saorview digital service. It can also be watched on Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, and online through RTÉ Player."
Coat of arms of Lesotho
"The Coat of arms of Lesotho was adopted in 2006, after Lesotho's 40th anniversary of independence, replacing the original one used from 1966 to 2006."
Pelton wheel
"The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight. Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear: Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water."
Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics
"The football competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics was the first Olympic football tournament dedicated to under-23 teams. The competition featured 16 men's national sides from the six continental confederations. The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four and each group played a round-robin tournament. At the end of the group stage, the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage, beginning with the quarter-finals and culminating with the gold medal match at Camp Nou on 8 August 1992."
Qualification.
The following 16 teams qualified for the 1992 Olympic men's football tournament:
Group stage.
Group A.

Fewer than one million Genesis Nomads were sold.
Erlasee Solar Park
"The Erlasee Solar Park is in one of the sunniest regions of Germany. On the former wine-producing Erlasee estate near Arnstein in Bavaria, in southern Germany, SOLON has constructed what is currently the largest tracking photovoltaic solar power station in the world with an output of 12 MW. Just under 1,500 ""SOLON-Movers"" modules convert sunlight into environmentally friendly power, generating as much as the average consumption of the nearby town of Arnstein."
The solar power plant cost £35 million and covers 77 hectares of land.
Khula
Khula is the right of a woman to ask her husband for a divorce and to offer him a compensation in case he does so. Following the Sharia the husband has no right to ask for a compensation of a higher value than that what he gave his wife when they married.
"After divorce the former husband is responsible for education, food and residence of children. The children live with the mother for 7 years. After 7 years children have the right to live with father or mother, as they decide."
Hashemi Rafsanjani
"Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (, ""Akbar Hāshemī Rafanjānī""), Hashemi Bahramani (; August 25, 1934 – January 8, 2017) was an influential Iranian politician. He has been the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2017."
"""Forbes"" magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he ""has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years."" His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of ""Akbar Shah"" in Iran."
"Rafsanjani was President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996."
"Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however."
"Rafsanjani died on January 8, 2017 in Tehran from a heart attack, aged 82."
Evander Holyfield
"Evander Holyfield (born October 19, 1962) is an American boxer. He held both the world heavyweight championship and the world cruiserweight championship. He also won a bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics."
"Holyfield was born in Atmore, Alabama. He became a professional boxer in 1984 and won the cruiserweight championship from Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. He moved to the heavyweight division in 1988 and won the world championship from James ""Buster"" Douglas in 1990. He defended the title three times, including fights against former champions Larry Holmes and George Foreman. He lost the title to Riddick Bowe in 1992 but won it back the next year. In 1994 he lost to Michael Moorer and briefly retired. He soon fought again, however, and surprised many by knocking out Mike Tyson in 1996. He had a draw against Lennox Lewis in 1998 and then lost a rematch to him in 1999."
"In 2005, Holyfield was a contestant on season 1 of ""Dancing with the Stars"". He was a housemate in the January 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK)."
Porthmadog F.C.
"Porthmadog Football Club is a football team, playing in the League of Wales. The club was started in 1884."
Sharia
"Sharia, Sharia law or Islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic culture. The Arabic word ""sharīʿah"" () refers to the revealed law of God and originally meant ""way"" or ""path""."
"Classical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life, including religious rituals, family life, business, crimes, and warfare. In former times, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists, who based their legal opinions on Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Some parts of sharia can be described as ""law"" in the usual sense of that word, while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
Modern countries in the Muslim world all have their own laws. In most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia. Muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world.
Meaning and origins.
"People of different religions who speak Arabic use the word ""sharīʿah"" to describe a religious tradition that comes from teachings of prophets. Christians and Jews in the Middle East have used it to describe their own religion. For many Muslims the word ""sharia"" means simply ""justice"". They will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society."
"Most Muslims think that sharia should be interpreted by experts in Islamic law. In Arabic, the word ""sharīʿah"" refers to God's revelation, which does not change. In contrast, the rules of behavior created by scholars as they try to understand God's revelation are called ""fiqh"". These rules can change and Islamic scholars have often disagreed about them."
Pinocchio
"Pinocchio is a fictional character from the 1883 book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" by Carlo Collodi."
"Pinocchio is a puppet, made by wood carver, Gepetto. When he tells lies, his nose gets longer. Pinocchio learns about being a real life boy and wants to be a real human being instead of a puppet made of wood and strings."
"The most well-known version of the story is the 1940 animated Disney movie ""Pinocchio""."
Diplomacy
"Diplomacy is the use of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge. It may include the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner. Diplomacy often involves countries making an agreement with each other, such as a treaty. Diplomacy is the talk between the representatives of states, such as their heads of state. Sometimes, these talks are about trade or business, and sometimes they are about war and peace. Diplomacy happens a lot when two or more countries fight."
"Diplomats are people that are sent from their home country, to meet with and talk to diplomats and leaders of foreign countries. An important type of diplomat is called an ambassador. An ambassador lives in a foreign country and works in an embassy to be available for meetings with the government of that country."
Acellular
Acellular or non-cellular life is life that exists without a cellular structure. Some scientists say that a virus is a type of life form.
Mexico (state)
"The state of México is one of the administrative divisions of the country of Mexico. It is one of 32 administrative divisions. It is in the centre of the country. It borders Hidalgo, Querétaro, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Michoacán, Morelos and Guerrero as well as Mexico City. The capital of the state is Toluca. Its biggest city is Ecatepec de Morelos, which borders Mexico Federal district. Teotihuacan is also in this state. It is about 21.355 km² in surface. About 14 million people live there as of 2005."
Yawn
"A yawn is a reflex. It involves a large, long taking in of air, the stretching of eardrums as the jaw opens wide, and last a (sometimes loud) breathing out. Pandiculation is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously. It is easy to see when someone is yawning, but no-one knows what its function is."
"Yawning is commonly associated with tiredness, stress, overwork, lack of stimulation and boredom. In humans, yawning is often triggered by others yawning (e.g. seeing a person yawning, talking to someone on the phone who is yawning) and is a typical example of positive feedback. This ""infectious"" yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees and dogs. Cats both yawn and stretch, though not necessarily at the same time."
Contagiousness.
"The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious. In 1508, Erasmus wrote, ""One man's yawning makes another yawn.,"" and the French proverbialized the idea to ""Un bon bâilleur en fait bâillier deux."" (""One good gaper makes two others gape""). Often, if one person yawns, this may cause another person to ""empathetically"" yawn. Observing another person's yawning face (especially his/her eyes), even reading, or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn."
"The immediate cause for contagious yawning may be the mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which, upon being exposed to a stimulus, activates the same regions in the brain. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation which lies at the root of much human learning such as language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse."
"Reasons, functions."
"Charles Darwin argued, in ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"", that if a behaviour was present in many cultures, then it must be inherited (wholly or partly). All traits which appear in a wide range of animals must have some function which is supported (or was supported) by natural selection. In most cases the function is obvious, but with yawning we do not know what that function is. Suggestions have been made, but they do not seem to account for its widespread occurrence in mammals, and possibly in other vertebrates."
Other vertebrates.
"Because mammals have similar emotions, and can show their emotions very clearly, it is agreed that when they look as if they are yawning, it is yawning in every sense. The reasons for this are similar to the reasons why we think other humans feel the same as us when the show the same signs."
Constantine
Constantine can mean:
Constantine Maroulis
"Constantine Maroulis (born September 17 1975) is an American singer, actor and writer from New York. He was on the popular television program ""American Idol"". With his past work experiences, he stands out from other ""American Idol"" singers. Before he was on television, he sang in the rock band Pray for the soul of Betty. Right now, he is taking a break from his band to sing on his own. He is the first ""Idol"" alum to sign a contract for the making of a new television sitcom."
"Theriodonts fall into three main groups: Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia and Cynodontia. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic."
"Theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids."
"Eutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants – the mammals. The name means ""true beast tooth"". The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles."
"The theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Lower Triassic."
"The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as ""Cynognathus"", as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts. While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed."
"By the Upper Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent-like tritylodonts (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, trithelodonts, which evolved into the first mammals. The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous, but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth."
Laura Ingraham
"Laura Ingraham (born 19 June 1964) is an American conservative political commentator, author and radio host. Her nationally syndicated talk show ""The Laura Ingraham Show"" was broadcast for nine years on the Talk Radio Network. She has been known for her controversial statements against the left wing party."
Peptide bond
"A peptide bond is a special chemical bond that happens between two amino acids. In the reaction (called condensation), the two amino acids are combined into a ""dipeptide""."
Repenomamus
Repenomamus is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.
"There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether ""Repenomamus"" was a hunter or a scavenger."
Life style.
"""Repenomamus"" was carnivorous. A specimen of ""R. robustus"" has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile ""Psittacosaurus"" preserved in its stomach."
"This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this."
"The larger species, ""R. giganticus"", is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. ""R. giganticus"" was more than 1 metre (39 inches) long and weighed about 12–14 kg (26–31 lb). Its skull measures 16 cm (6.25 in) long, its body 52 cm (20.5 in), and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm (14 in)."
Discovery.
"The fossils were recovered from the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period."
"""Repenomamus"" is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives."
Frederick William III of Prussia
Frederick William III () (3 August 1770 – 7 June 1840) was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840.
Life.
"Frederick William was born in Potsdam in 1770 as the son of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy,"
"As a soldier he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his lieutenancy in 1784, became a colonel in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792-1794. On December 24, 1793, Frederick William married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They had ten children. In the ""Kronprinzenpalais"" (Crown Prince's palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797."
Reign.
He succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797 and took over personal power without giving responsibility to his ministers. Unfortunately he was not able to follow a consistent course for himself.
His sense of duty can be seen from this quote:
"Usual prizes will be small amount of money, simple reward like pen or cup, or entry in to competition to win something."
Details.
"Web-based survey have come a long way, from 1980s where first email surveys were conducted to 1990s when initial web-based surveys were introduced. There were almost $500 million spent on web-based surveys in 2002, and According to Inside Research this number climbed up to about $960 million in 2004."
"But despite the advances in survey research, there are still many short comings and problems, such as declining response rates, limited online data bases, mistrust about survey uses (true research versus selling), survey length, issues concerning privacy and security, internet surveys being looked at as spam by some etc."
"Most of Online Surveys that are real will not pay cash, but instead give vouchers or prizes."
"Online or Internet surveys are very useful for many companies. People get rewarded for answering questions about a product, a company or any questions that will help the company to work better."
"Many companies pay people to take a survey, but some are for free."
"In era of digital surveys there is many fraud cases where user will be not paid after completing one. Some ways of avoiding fraud sites is to check them on MyWot, review sites or by simply checking their reviews on forums."
It is getting more popular to fill surveys to get access to website or valuable content.
"Another popular form of surveys that has recently emerged are daily surveys. Daily survey panels allow their members to participate in surveys everyday. The user is taken through a router where they can keep trying to qualify until a survey is found that matches their demographics. Daily surveys pay less than most paid surveys, but the opportunity to qualify is much greater and payouts are usually cash instead of prizes."
"Businesses spend $18.7 billion worldwide on market research, as reported by CASRO."

Lifeline (crisis support service)
"Lifeline is a non-profit organisation that provides free, 24-hour telephone support to people in need. Lifeline Assistance do not make any profit."
A lifeline Assistance called Volunteer Crisis Supporters provides suicide prevention services (trying to persuade people not to kill themselves) and mental health support (helping with depression and other issues). They help people not only by telephone but face-to-face too and online.
"Most people that work at the Telephone Lifeline work for free. They are called volunteers. They are very well trained to help people with any problems. More than 400,000 calls are served by the Lifeline Assistance every year."
"Some Lifeline Centres also provide other support services that may have group support, assistance with food &amp; bills and support for the old people."
Lifeline has more than 260 retail outlets around Australia that sell clothes and furniture to make enough money to pay for training and office space they use. Some Lifeline Centres have few stores which helps them with day-to-day spending. Some lifelines can provide people in need with free mobile phones thanks to government grants.
"The 2010 report recorded 2,361 deaths by suicide in Australia, 480 more deaths than in 2007."

"William Pelham ""Bill"" Barr (born May 23, 1950) is an American attorney. He was the 85th Attorney General of the United States from February 14, 2019 to December 23, 2020 under the Donald Trump presidency. Before, he was the 77th Attorney General under the George H. W. Bush presidency from 1991 to 1993."
"On December 7, 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Barr to again serve as Attorney General of the United States. He was confirmed, for a second time, as Attorney General on February 14, 2019, and assumed office later the same day."
"On December 14, 2020, Trump announced that Barr would be resigning as attorney general, effective December 23."
Nicholas Katzenbach
"Nicholas deBelleville ""Nick"" Katzenbach (January 17, 1922 – May 8, 2012) was an American lawyer. He was the United States Attorney General during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. He was Attorney General from February 1965 through October 1966."
Elliot Richardson
"Elliot Lee Richardson (July 20, 1920 December 31, 1999) was an American lawyer and politician. He was a member of the cabinet of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. As U.S. Attorney General, he was a known figure in the Watergate Scandal, and resigned rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox."
"Richardson served as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973, Secretary of Defense from January to May 1973, Attorney General from May to October 1973, and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four Cabinet positions within the United States government (the other such individual being George Shultz)."
"On December 31, 1999, Richardson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79."
Frequency probability
"Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments."
"This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn."
Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory
Satellite navigation
A satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly.
"Satnav uses a system of satellites. The system gives exact positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to find their position (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). The position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line (line of sight) by radio from satellites. The signals also allow the receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Global Positioning System is the biggest and most used GNSS. GLONASS, owned by Russia, is the second biggest. China, India, and the European Union are working on similar systems of their own."
Bad Santa
Bad Santa is a 2003 American Christmas criminal black comedy movie.
Property law
"Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents."
History.
"The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called ""dominion""."
"In classical antiquity, the river was known as the ""Ōxus"" in Latin and Ὦξος ""Oxos"" in Greek."
"The name ""Amu"" is said to have come from the medieval city of ""Āmul"", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as ""Türkmenabat""), in modern Turkmenistan. ""Darya"" is the Persian word for ""river""."
"Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's ""Wakhan Corridor"", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's"" Kyzyl Kum"" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times."
In hadith.
"In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan)."
As the river Jayhan.
"Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Jayhan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghanastan historians. ."
Description.
"The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D."
"Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the ""Syr Darya"" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek)."
Watershed.
"About of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan."
"Of the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river."
"This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the ""Zeravshan River"") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe."
"The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and ""Tian Shan"","
"which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about ."
History.
The Amu Darya is (also theJayhan river)
"was called the ""Oxus"" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river Jayhan was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river Jayhan drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Jayhan river northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea."
"It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian."
"People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities."
"The first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Viné collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862."
"The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built."
Literature.
"The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus."
Founding Fathers of the United States
"The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, either helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term ""Founding Fathers"" was first used for these people in 1916."
"There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison."
"Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. Most of them owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government. Five of them, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, were later elected president of the United States."
CNDO/2
"Korean uses two different writing systems. One is Hangul, the main alphabet. In North Korea, only Hangeul (Known as Choseongeul in North Korea) is used by law. In South Korea, only Hangeul should be used in most public areas like education, but the other system, Hanja, is still used in some newspapers and professional areas. Hanja is the system of Chinese characters that are used in Korean. It was the only way to write Korean before the creation of Hangeul in the 15th century, and it was common in novels before the 19th century."
"Although King Sejong the Great led the development of Hangeul to allow literacy to spread among common people and to create a writing system that represented the language more accurately than Hanja, it was not adopted by the upper classes of Koreans. Hanja would continue to be the official writing system until the late 19th century. Although it was rejected by the elite classes, Hangeul was used often by lower classes as a way to write down Korean literature and for lower classes to communicate."
Kansas
"Kansas () is a state in the Midwestern United States of America. The name of the state comes from the Kansa Native Americans, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning ""people of the south wind"". The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Kansas's capital is Topeka, and its biggest city is Wichita."
"Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 when Fort Leavenworth was built. In the 1850s, many more people came to live in Kansas. This was also when people were fighting about slavery. People were allowed to move to Kansas in 1854 because of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. When this happened, anti-slavery Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery people from Missouri quickly came to Kansas. They wanted to decide whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Because of this, a lot of fighting happened, and it was known as Bleeding Kansas. The anti-slavery people won. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state."
"Kansas is in a region known as ""America's Breadbasket"". Like other states in this area, Kansas makes a lot of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat; they make one-fifth of all wheat grown in the United States. Kansas has other industries too, including aviation and communications. Kansas has an area of , which is the 15th-biggest state by area. Kansas is also 34th most-populous of the 50 states because 2,913,314 people live there. People who live in Kansas are called ""Kansans"". Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest place at ."
The terrain of Kansas consists of prairies and forests. All of Kansas is in the Great Plains.
Etymology.
"The name ""Kansas"" comes from the Algonquian term, ""Akansa"", for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who moved to Arkansas around the 13th century. The stem -""kansa"" is named after the Kaw people. They are also known as the ""Kansa"", a federally recognized Native American tribe."
History.
Early history.
"In 1539, Marcos de Niza, a friar, reported rumors of Cíbola, a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City. Niza said the city was in modern-day New Mexico. In response to the rumors, two years later, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, with an army of 3000 Spaniards and 8001 Mexicans, marched northward from Culiacán in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley, crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains, including Kansas. Later, Juan de Oñate also traveled to Kansas in 1601."
"In 1682, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, Louis Hennepin and other French leaders took formal control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana territory, was used to organize trade with Native Americans. In 1763, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain."
"Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish Louisiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the indians tribes, among the explorers were Antoine de Marigny and others who continued trading across the Kansas River, especially at its confluence with the Missouri River, tributaries of the Mississippi River."
"However, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their native lands."
Statehood.
"On May 30, 1854, the Congress signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territories of the United States. It also stated that Kansans would vote on the legality of slavery."
"Upon hearing this, about 1,200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from Missouri, came to vote for slavery. The final vote was to make slavery legal, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, John Brown and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called ""Bleeding Kansas""."
"Between 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state constitutions. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution, which was anti-slavery. The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on. The constitution was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate. This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery. In 1861, after the Confederate states formed, the constitution gained approval from the Union, and Kansas became a state."
Kansas in the Civil War.
"Four months after Kansas became a state, the Civil War started. Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War, four were fought in Kansas. Throughout the war, Kansas remained a Union state."
"On August 21, 1863, William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill and his troops burned, looted, and destroyed the anti-slavery town. This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre. In total, 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre. In the Battle of Mine Creek, on October 25, 1864, Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek. The Union surrounded the Confederates, and captured 600 men and two generals. 1,000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle. In total, 8,500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War."
Post Civil War.
"After the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. This is because the slaves wanted economic opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas. African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to escape sharecropping. These people were called ""Exodusters."""
Recent history.
Dust Bowl.
"From 1930 to 1936, Kansas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. During this time, Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures. Thousands of farmers became very poor and had to move to other parts of the United States. In total, 400,000 people left the Great Plains area. The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down. The number of people living in Kansas decreased 4.3 percent."
"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas."
"During the 1950s, school segregation was required in fifteen U.S states. However, Kansas was not one of these states. Instead, school segregation was permitted by local option, but only in elementary schools. In 1896, the ruling from ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" stated that segregation was allowed, but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites. Often, however, black schools received less funding and had fewer textbooks than white schools."
"For these reasons, Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Brown won the case, and the ruling was to overturn the ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" decision. This was considered by many a landmark case in the civil rights movement."
Geography.
Slavery.
"Slavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world. But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery."
"Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean. Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas. While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently."
"Africans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard."
Colonialism.
"In the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia"")."
"Egypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922."
Modern history.
"African independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent. Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent."
"A civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people."
Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.
Climate.
"From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:"
"Running north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes."
"In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types."
Rainfall.
"Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert."
"In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast"
of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.
These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.
"Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:"
Plants and animals.
"Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers."
Politics.
"The African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP."
"Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa."
People.
Africa was the homeland for the first people.
"People who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic."
The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.
African diaspora.
Countries with significant African descendents outside Africa:

Gifted education
Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.
"Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage."
"In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word ""gifted,"" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An ""aptitude"" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. ""Competence"" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10 percent of the population."
Sport England
"Sport England is the name for the English Sports Council. It is a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It works with national governing bodies of sport to grow the number of people in sports. Their goal is to keep these people in the sports. Sport England also helps more talented people do well by identifying them early, nurturing them, and helping them move up to the top level."
"Sport England has two statutory, functions: (1) a lottery distributor for sport; and (2) it must be consulted on planning applications that affect playing fields. The funding it distributes comes from both H.M. Treasury and the National Lottery. Since 1994, it has invested over £2bn of lottery funds and £300 million from the Exchequer into sports in England."
"Bailey represented Doctor Sam Sheppard on appeal after Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife. Bailey managed to get Sheppard a retrial, in which Bailey was successful in getting Sheppard acquitted. Bailey was the lead lawyer in successfully defending in the court martial for the My Lai Massacre. Bailey, along with others, successfully defended O. J. Simpson in the trial where Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown."
"In 2014, the Maine State Bar Association and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court denied Bailey's petition to have his law license reinstated."
"Bailey died in Atlanta, Georgia on June 3, 2021, one week before his 88th birthday."
Stuffed animal fetishism

Albert Einstein Square
"Albert Einstein Square (, ""Kikar Albert Einstein"") is a public square in Jerusalem, Israel. it is located in the entrance of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at the Talbiya neighborhood in Jerusalem."
Albert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days. He gave the first lecture at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
"Einstein was in favor of the Hebrew University, as well as Zionism and education in general. This is the reason the square is named for him. Also, a statue of Einstein is nearby in the gardens of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities."
Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on February 3, 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to impose a federal income tax. This allows the federal government to collect a tax on personal income, no matter where that income came from. The Sixteenth Amendment overturned the 1895 Supreme Court landmark decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co"". In ""Pollock"", the Court ruled that a 2 percent tax on incomes over $4,000 was unconstitutional. This was because the law the ruling struck down did not allow for apportionment, the court ruled against it. The Sixteenth Amendment allowed Congress to levy a uniform direct income tax without being subject to apportionment."
Background.
"When the framers of the Constitution were determining how the new government would be funded, they were trying to avoid a tax based on a person's income. In the Constitution, Article one, Sections 2 and 9 created the ""rule of apportionment"". On a practical basis this required Congress to tax the states based on each state's population instead of a tax on each person's income or property. For example, if a state made up four percent of the total population, they would be required to pay four percent of the total federal tax. The framers of the Constitution expected direct taxes to be used and defined the term broadly. However, they did not see that apportionment would cripple any attempt to collect direct taxes."
"Before 1913, the bulk of federal revenues came from indirect taxes on goods. These include tariffs on goods imported into the country. They also included excise taxes on items like whiskey. Income taxes were not new in 1913. Congress had passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War to help pay for the war. Ten years later it was allowed to lapse. The Confederate States of America also had an income tax. Starting in 1863, the tax exempted the first $1,000 and charged a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption. A 2% tax was levied on all income over that amount."
"In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act which included a flat rate federal income tax of 2 percent. A year later, the Supreme Court handed down their decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co."". They ruled the tax unconstitutional because it was a direct tax and not apportioned to the population of each state."
A constitutional income tax.
"On June 16, 1909, President Taft sent a message to the Senate which read:"
"After a debate on the floor of the House lasting five hours, the bill was passed 314-14 (1 vote as ""present"" and 55 not voting). It was then sent to the state legislatures for ratification. The amendment gave Congress the power to apply a direct tax, based on people's incomes, and not subject to the apportionment rule."
Effects of the Sixteenth Amendment.
"The largest and most direct effect of the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment was it shifted power from the states to the national government. States had income taxes before the national government did. This kept the national government weaker due to having less revenue than the states. Without the Sixteenth Amendment, the national government would find it far more difficult to extend its military power to other parts of the world."

"Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart."
Forced disappearance of Stuart Angel.
"Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October (""Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro"" – MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames ""Paulo"" and ""Henrique"". He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police."
"Officers of the Air Force Information Center (""Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica"" – CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from rasphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found."
Aftermath.
"Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book ""History of the Brazilian Republic"" by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed."
Death.
"Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events."
"In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named"
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this boo he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others."
"Cláudio Antônio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdigão had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission."
Homages and cultural references.
"Stuart Angel is the patron of Juventude Revolucionária 8 de Outubro, MR-8's youth branch. MR-8 is now a faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement."
"The lyrics of the song ""Cálice"", written by Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil make reference tp Stuart's probable death by asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In homage to Zuzu Angel, and other mothers who were unable to bury their children, Buarque wrote the song ""Angélica"" in 1977."
"In 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the ""movie Zuzu Angel"", directed by Sérgio Rezende. The movie, in which Daniel de Oliveira plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death."
"The Tunnel Dois Irmãos, which connects Gávea to São Conrado, the same place where Zuzu's car crashed, was renamed after her."
"In 2015, Angel was commemorated on her 94th birthday with a Google Doodle featuring a motif adapted from the prints she used in her designs."

"Inchenhofen (also known as ""Leahad"" in the local dialect) is a municipality in the district of Aichach-Friedberg in Bavaria in Germany."
Length of time.
"Disputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong."
Fundamental values.
"Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals."
Media spread disputes.
"A second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute."
Laws.
"Laws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute."
How disputes are resolved.
Negotiation.
"The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful."
"The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated."
Mediation.
"Professional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations."
Time.
"Some disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation."
Law.
"All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not."
Direct action.
"Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute."
Education.
"Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict."
Democracy.
"Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies."
Examples.
"Of course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance."

"Seating capacity is the highest number of people who can sit in a specific space. This limit can be either from the amount of space available, or from a law saying how many people are allowed to be there at a time."
"Seating capacity can be for different kinds of things. It can be the number of people who can fit in a vehicle, for example an automobile or an airplane. It can also be for a stadium. The largest sports building in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity of more than 257,000 people. Seats can be added on the field to raise that number to about 400,000."
Apotropaic magic
"Vrilissia is a twin city of Naples, Italy and Ottweiler in Germany. In Ottweiler, a main bridge is named after the Greek city."
Squall
"A squall is a quick and big increase in wind speed which is usually linked to weather such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow."
Oxford English Dictionary
"The Oxford English Dictionary (or OED) is a dictionary. It is published by the Oxford University Press in England, and is the largest English dictionary."
"It traces (or follows in detail) the historical development of the English language, and is a resource to writers and scholars. It describes how the language has been used."
"The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989. Number of main entries is 231,100 and number of main entries for out-of -date words is 47,100."
"Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in parts, under the name of ""A New English Dictionary on historical principles; founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society"". In 1895, the title ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" (""OED"") was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" was reprinted as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published. Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately a third of which is now complete."
"The first electronic version of the dictionary was done in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, feels it unlikely that it will ever be printed."
Thomas Beecham
"Sir Thomas Beecham (born St Helens, Lancashire, 29 April 1879; died London, 8 March 1961) was an English conductor. He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius."
He often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.
Early life.
"Beecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham’s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician."
"Thomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hallé Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success."
Early career.
"In 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers such as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes when they first came to England."
"During World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people the chance to hear music they had never heard before."
"For several years he had money problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner’s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia."
Later career.
"In 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth."
His fame.
"Beecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England."
"He was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvořák. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published."
There are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.
Famous quotations.
A lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because “they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them”.
Beecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: “My God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!”
"Beecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: “The same again, gentlemen, please”."

Barry Marshall
"Barry James Marshall, AC, FRS, FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian doctor and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria ""Helicobacter pylori"" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University."
Early years.
"Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion."
Life and research.
"In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of ""H. pylori"". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that ""Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right"". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the ""H. pylori"" idea could be proved."
"Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between ""H. pylori"" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal."
"After this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at ""H. pylori"" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA."
Awards and honours.
"In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium ""Helicobacter pylori"" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease."
Marshall was given other awards including:
He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.
Diglossia
"Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use. One is the common language they use every day, and the other is either a much older version from centuries before (for example, Arabic or Chinese) or a similar but clearly different modern-day version (for example, Norwegian with Bokmål and Nynorsk)."
Mutual intelligibility
Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are alike. This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different languages or different dialects.
"There are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and spelling between British and General American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible."
"Sometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani, the official language of British India until India became independent. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu."
"Also, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin, Shanghainese/Wu Chinese, and Cantonese/Yue in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other."
"The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is named for the river Indus and Ancient India on its north shore. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean."
"The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is in the Java Trench near the Sunda Islands in the east, 7500 m (25,344 feet) deep. The average depth is 3,890 m (12,762 ft). The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean, 28,350,000 square miles in size. The majority is in the southern hemisphere."
Arctic Ocean
"The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans."
"The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming."
"The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at ."
Geography.
"The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2. The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands."
"It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea."
"Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States."
Climate.
"The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies."
"The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs."
Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
"The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms."
Animal and plant life.
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Inuit
"The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and Alaska."
"They are sometimes called ""Eskimos"", a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean ""eater of raw meat"" which is a fallacy many believe due to misinformation. The term Eskimo means ""netter of snowshoes. Most Inuit prefer to be called by their own name, either the more general Inuit particularly in Canada or their actual tribe name. Inuit is a tribe name but not all indigenous Arctic peoples in North America are Inuits. Particularly in the United States Alaska, the word Eskimo would be accepted as a more general term, but would probably refer to themselves by their tribe name."
Etymology.
"Inuit in Canada and Greenland like the name ""Inuit"" because it is their own name for themselves. ""Inuit"" means more than one, one person is an ""Inuk"". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream United States where such concerns get less attention."
"Inuits in Alaska have various concerns, such as protecting the caribou from American oil pipelines. Anti-seal hunt campaigns work to eliminate this aspect of northern culture, which most Inuits regard as vital to their lives."
Traditional culture.
"Inuit ate both raw and cooked meat and fish, as well as the fetus's of pregnant animals. Whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps."
"Inuit were also Nomadic people, but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs, which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting. They were hunter-gatherers, living off the land. They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed. Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture."
"Inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer. In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos. They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours. Snow is full of air spaces, which helps it hold in warmth. With just a blubber lamp for heat, an igloo could be warmer than the air outside. The Inuit made very clever things from the bones, antlers, and wood they had. They invented the harpoon, which was used to hunt seals and whales. They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins. They invented the ""kayak"" for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice."
"Inuit sleds could be built from wood, bone, or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish. Dishes were made from carving soapstone, bones, or musk ox horns. They wore two layers of skins, one fur side in, the other facing out, to stay warm."
"Inuit had to be good hunters to survive. When an animal was killed in a hunt, it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter. They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children. Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system. In the winter, seals did not come out onto the ice. They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice. Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes, then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a harpoon. In the summer, the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun. The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it. The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration."
"The Inuit even hunted whales. From their boat, they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of inflated seal skins. The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water. When it slowed down and came up to the surface, the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died. Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet, and prevented rickets. The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population, and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world. Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods, which are normally very expensive in the north."
"Henry the Navigator started by paying Portuguese sailors to explore the west coast of Africa. In 1419 Joao Goncalves Zarco discovered the Madeira Islands. Later in the 15th century, Vasco da Gama reached the southwestern tip of Africa and established the city of Cape Town, a Portuguese colony. This opened the way to the Indian Ocean. In the next two centuries, the Portuguese created a great trading empire on coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The Portuguese Empire eventually weakened after the Dutch East India Company rose as the major power in Indian Ocean trade."
Spanish Empire.
"In a hurry to compete with Portugal for a colonial empire, Spain sent Christopher Columbus to the opposite route of the Portuguese. Instead of going south along the west coast of Africa, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. He believed that he came to Asia. Later, some Spanish sailors found out that this land was a different continent than Asia. It is now called the Americas."
"In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores gained the whole of what later became Latin America, except some British and French colonies in northeastern South America, and Brazil, which belonged to Portugal. The Spanish concentrated on conquest, unlike the Portuguese who focused on trading. They eventually developed a vast colonial empire, in contrast to the Portuguese who ruled a few islands and coastal cities along the Indian Ocean. When Spain and Portugal were united under King Philip II of Spain , their combined empire was the largest on earth."
In 1522 the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan returned to Spain. The survivors were the first ever to sail all the way around the world.
"Britain, France, and the Netherlands."
"In the 17th century, political and religious wars with Britain, France, and the Netherlands weakened the Iberian Peninsula. These three nations emerged as the main winners of the wars and became major powers like Spain and Portugal. In the next two centuries, the world became a battlefield of the three nations. Britain and France held land in North America, in India and other distant places. The Dutch colonized smaller parts of the Americas, took the former Portuguese trading centers around the Indian Ocean, and conquered Indonesia. These three new great powers also had influence all around the world."
"Eventually, the result was a series of wars that were fought both in Europe and overseas, with Britain emerging victorious. The British took the former land of French Canada and India in the 18th century. They seized power in the Indian Ocean and defeated the Dutch navy. By 1763, the British Empire had become the second global empire after Spain. However, in 1776, thirteen colonies of British America declared independence. With help from the French, Dutch and Spanish, they defeated Britain in the American Revolution."
Exploration of the Southern Pacific Ocean.
"In 1778, Captain James Cook of Britain sailed across the South Pacific Ocean looking for a mysterious continent in the Southern Hemisphere. He landed on two large islands. Then he sailed west and found a bigger piece of land. The first, was modern New Zealand; the second was Australia. Captain Cook claimed these lands for Britain. He then explored the Pacific world for another year and died in a fight with the Hawaiians."
Effects of the Age of Discovery.
"Many slaves brought from Africa were brought to the Americas which was claimed to be found by Christopher Columbus himself. In conclusion, the Portuguese were weakened after the Dutch rose in the Indian Ocean trade route. Spain gained almost all of Latin America and a massive amount of silver."
"When Christopher Columbus tried to find a new trade route to Asia, he thought that he could travel around the world. Instead, he had found a New World. Vikings had briefly visited Vinland around 1000 A.D."
Persian lime
"Persian Lime (""Citrus x latifolia""), also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit. It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the U.S. It is sold simply as a ""lime"". The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter. Very often, it has slightly nippled ends. It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life."
"Persian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Martínez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas."

Kaffir lime
"The Kaffir lime (""Citrus hystrix ""DC., Rutaceae), also known as kieffer lime, makrut or magrood, is a citrus fruit native to Indonesia. It is widely grown worldwide as a garden shrub. It is usually grown it for its fruit, the lime. The leaves are used for cooking. Vegetable oil obtained from the leaves is used to make perfumes."
The plant.
"The plant is a very thorny bush with aromatic leaves. The oil obtained from the rind of the fruit can be used as an insecticide. The plant is well suited to being grown in a container. The green fruits are different from other limes because of their bumpy and rough exterior. They are also quite small, about 4 centimetres across. The leaves are shaped like an hourglass. The leaves and the leaf-shaped stem are widely used in the cuisine of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos."
"""Citrus x hystrix"" leaves are also popular in Cambodia but less so in Vietnam. Malay, Burmese and Indonesian (especially Balinese and Javanese; see also Indonesian bay leaf) cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish."
The leaves can be used fresh or dried and can be stored frozen.
"Although the most common product of the ""Citrus x hystrix"" tree is its leaves (which give a sharp Lime/neroli flavour to Cambodian base paste known as Krueng, Thai dishes such as tom yum and Indonesian food such as sayur assam - literally ""sour vegetables""), the juice and rind of the small, dark-green gnarled fruit (known as jeruk obat - literally ""medicine citrus"") are used in traditional Indonesian medicine."
"The zest is widely used in Creole cuisine and to impart flavour to ""arranged"" rums on Réunion and Madagascar."
Other names.
"Other names for ""Citrus x hystrix"":"
Terminology.
"""The Oxford Companion to Food"" () recommends that the name ""kaffir lime"" should be avoided in favour of ""makrut lime"" because ""Kaffir"" is an offensive term in certain cultures and also has no clear reason for being attached to this plant. However ""kaffir lime"" appears to be much more common."
His importance in English music.
"Some of Vaughan Williams’s best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song. He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called ""On Wenlock Edge"" for tenor, piano and string quartet. His music always sounds English. He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good. Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar (who was a little older) made people realise that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful, moving music."

Recycling
"Recycling is when you recover scrap or waste and reprocessing the material into useful products. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are often recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting."
"It is important not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out."
"Recycling reduces trash in landfills and incinerators. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, ""The Economist"" says. Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world."
"The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle."
Plastic recycling.
"Most people make about two kilograms of waste (trash) every day, and about 7% of this waste is made up of plastic products that can be recycled. Today, plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables, park benches, and even high-chairs."
Sort it out.
"First, plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center, where it is ""sorted out"". When plastic is sorted out, symbols have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used. There are two types of plastic: ""polyethylene"" and ""polymer"". There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic, too: ""high density polyethylene"" (HDPE), and ""low density polyethylene"" (LDPE). HDPE plastic is usually used to make furniture, and LDPE plastic are usually things like milk jugs, plastic and grocery bags."
Grinding washing.
"HDPE plastic is ground into a small powder. LDPE plastic, which are usually thin films, need to be ground by a special machine. After that, both plastics are washed with hot water and detergent. Dirt and other things, like labels, are taken off. After the wash, the powder is dried with hot air."
"Sometimes, the powder is sold. But other times, the powder is heated, colored, and then put into a ""pelletizer"". The pelletizer makes the powder into little pellets, which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic ""wood"". This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots, trash cans, pipes, picnic tables, benches, toys, mats, and many other things."
Transnistria
"Transnistria, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR; ), is a de facto country in Eastern Europe. It came to be between 1990 and 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Transnistria declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a ""frozen conflict"" area. Currently, no state recognises Transnistria, officially the territory is part of Moldova."
"There is argument about whether Transnistria is really a country or not. It is recognized by three other unrecognized or partly recognized states: Abkhazia, Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The area continues to claim independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries."
"In a vote on 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the area the ""Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester""."
Transnistria is the only state to still use the hammer and sickle symbol on its flag.
"Russia has a big influence on the territory. Between 1.500 and 2.000 Ruassian soldiers are stationed on the territory. In addition, there may be up to 10.000 paramilitary troops."
"Moldovans, Russians, and Ukraians make up about a third of the population each."
Mercalli intensity scale
"The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, they classify earthquakes by the effects they have (and the destruction they cause). When there is little damage, the scale describes how people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it."
"Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale."
Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic.
"Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902, Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels. August Heinrich Sieberg completely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale."
"Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. Charles Francis Richter also edited it. He also developed the Richter scale, later on."
"On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Garland to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia."
"Garland has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. He is the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1971."
"After Republicans refused to give Garland a confirmation hearing, Garland's nomination was expired in January 2017 shortly before the inauguration of Donald Trump. Trump said he will announce his Justice nominee for the Supreme Court on January 31, 2017."
United States Attorney General.
"On January 6, 2021, then President-elect Joe Biden said that we would nominate Garland to be the United States Attorney General during his administration."
"On March 1, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15-7 to advance Garland's nomination to a full Senate vote. On March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland by a vote of 70-30 to become the next Attorney General."
Personal life.
"Garland married Lynn in 1977. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland."
Article Three of the United States Constitution
"Article Three of the United States Constitution creates the judicial branch of the United States government. It creates the Supreme Court of the United States, and allows the United States Congress to create less powerful federal courts. It also sets out the powers that these courts have."
Section 1: Federal courts.
"Section 1 of Article Three starts out by creating the Supreme Court one court that will be more powerful than any other court in the country. It also gives Congress the power to create ""inferior"" (less powerful) federal courts."
It allows judges in these courts to get a regular salary for their work. Section 1 protects the judges by saying that their salaries will not be decreased while they are in office (working as a federal judge).
Tenure.
"Section 1 says that judges ""shall hold their Offices [keep their jobs] during good Behavior."" This is meant to protect federal judges, and also to make sure that the federal judiciary is independent."
"Before it won its independence in the American Revolutionary War, America was a colony of the British Empire. The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution just four years after the War ended. They still remembered what the courts in the American colonies were like. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, Britain's King George III ""made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries."""
"This meant that the judges could not be independent or impartial. If they made a decision that King George did not like, they could be fired, or not paid. Judges who wanted to keep their jobs made decisions based on what King George would want, not based on what the law said. If judges are cannot be independent, or do not follow they law, courts are not fair, and there is no way for regular people to get justice."
"The Constitution makes sure that this will not happen to United States federal judges. By saying judges ""shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,"" Section 1 is basically allowing judges to keep their jobs for the rest of their lives. In , the Constitution does say that Congress can take away a judge's job but only after being convicted in a trial, and only for ""Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."" (This is what Section 1 means by behavior that is not ""good."") In other words, the Constitution makes sure that all judges will lose their jobs for making even the slightest unpopular decision. This denies judges the freedom to be independent, and to make the decisions that they think are fair, and makes them choose between right and reelection."
Number of courts.
"Article III clearly allows only one Supreme Court. However, it does not say how many Supreme Court Justices (judges) there should be. Congress solved this problem in 1948 by passing a law. The law says that the Supreme Court will have 9 Justices, including one Chief Justice."
"In both Section 1 and in , the Constitution gives Congress the right to create courts that are ""inferior"" to the Supreme Court. However, the Constitution does not say how many ""inferior"" courts there should be, or how they should be set up. It leaves those decisions to Congress. Congress decided to create two different kinds of ""inferior"" courts (also called ""lower courts""). In the Judiciary Act of 1789, they created:"
"Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury."
Clause 1: Cases and controversies.
"Clause 1 of Section 2 explains the powers the federal court has, and the limits of those powers."
"Clause 1 gives the federal courts the power to hear and judge actual ""cases and controversies"" only. For example, they cannot hear a case about a situation that might come up in the future."
Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction.
"When Clause 2 talks about ""jurisdiction,"" it is talking about who has the power to hear a case."
Original jurisdiction.
"""Original jurisdiction"" is the power to hear a case first, before any other court. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in:"
Appellate jurisdiction.
"In all the other cases mentioned in Clause 2, the Supreme Court has ""appellate jurisdiction."" That means another court has the power to hear the case first. If somebody appeals that court's decision, the Supreme Court can take the case on appeal. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court the power to hear appeals on:"
Air Supply
"Air Supply is a pop music singing group. They formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1976."
"The current members are Russell Hitchcock (born June 15, 1949 in Melbourne) and Graham Russell (born June 1, 1950 in Nottingham, England). In 1981 they got with their song ""The One That You Love"" a number one hit in the United States. They had their most popular times during the early 1980s."
Sex Pistols
"The Sex Pistols were the first popular punk group in Britain and one of the first bands to come from the rising U.K. punk scene of the late 1970s. They were only together for about 3 years, from late 1975 to early 1978, and they were known for their rowdy behaviour more than their music. The music they made gave many new artists a big influence on their music, mostly in the alternative music and punk scenes such as California punk rock group Green Day."
"The band members were Johnny Rotten (vocals), Paul Cook (drums), Steve Jones (guitar) and Glen Matlock (bass). Sid Vicious later replaced Matlock on bass in February 1977 but died 2 years later. They recorded only one studio album, called ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols"" during the summer of 1977. One of their most famous songs is ""Anarchy In The UK"". Another one of their most famous songs is ""God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)"", which was banned by the BBC for it's contents. They split up after a show at Winterland on January 14th, 1978, with Rotten saying ""You ever get the feelin' you're bein' cheated?"""
Walter Murphy
"Walter Murphy (b. December 19, 1952) is a classically trained American pianist. He was born in New York City. He had a hit song in the late 1970s, ""A Fifth of Beethoven""."
Bette Davis
"Bette Davis (April 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989), full name Ruth Elizabeth Davis, was an American actress of the stage, cinema and television. She was born in Lowell, Massachusetts. She was nicknamed ""The Queen of Hollywood"" or the ""First Lady of the American Screen"" and ""The Fifth Warner Brother"" during her career."
Davis had held the most Academy Award nominations for any actress (with ten) until Katharine Hepburn took her place with twelve.
Bette Davis made over 100 films across 60 years. Some of the most popular
"films include: ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), ""Marked Woman"" (1937), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""Dark Victory"" (1939), ""The Letter"" (1940), ""The Little Foxes"" (1941), ""Now, Voyager"" (1942), ""Watch on the Rhine"" (1943), ""Mr. Skeffington"" (1944), ""All About Eve"" (1950), ""The Virgin Queen"" (1955), ""The Catered Affair"" (1956), ""Pocketful of Miracles"" (1961), ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" (1962), ""Death on the Nile"" (1978) and ""The Whales of August"" (1987)."
"In 1981 Kim Carnes sang the hit song ""Bette Davis Eyes"". Davis liked the song. Carnes gave Davis a gold record. Davis hung the gold record on a wall."
"The Kennedy Center honored Davis in 1987. She died of breast cancer in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France."
Gunpowder Plot
"The Gunpowder Conspiracy of 1605 was a plan to assassinate King James I of England and VI of Scotland. Other names for the plot are The Powder Treason or The Gunpowder Plot. A group of Catholics wanted to blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. This would have killed the king, and most of the Protestant aristocracy."
"The conspirators also planned to kidnap the royal children, and lead a popular revolt in the Midlands."
Origins.
"Robert Catesby led the planning of the conspiracy, which started in May 1604. The people who helped him were either rich Catholics, or gentry families who had a lot of influence. Catesby may have come up with the plot when he saw that there was little hope that Great Britain would become more tolerant to Roman Catholics, under King James I. Many Catholics were disappointed about the situation. It is more likely though that Catesby simply wanted to give the Catholics in England a chance: The plot was to be the first step of a rebellion. Afterwards, James' nine-year-old daughter (Princess Elizabeth) could be put in as a Catholic head of state."
"Other plotters were Thomas Winter (also spelled Wintour), Robert Winter, John Wright, Christopher Wright, Robert Keyes, Thomas Percy (also spelled Percye), John Grant, Ambrose Rokewood, Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresham and Thomas Bates (Catesby's servant). The explosives were prepared by Guy ""Guido"" Fawkes, a man with 10 years military experience. Fawkes had fought with the Spanish against the Dutch in the Spanish Netherlands."
"The main Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet was said to know the details of the plot. Oswald Tesimond, a fellow Jesuit had told him. Robert Catesby confessed them to Tesimond, and gave him the permission to tell Garnet. Although he was convicted, there has since been some debate over how much Garnet really knew. As the details of the plot were known through confession, Garnet was not allowed to reveal them to the authorities. He did not think it was a good idea. Nevertheless, the plot went ahead. Garnet's opposition to it did not save him from being hanged, drawn and quartered for treason in 1606, though."
Planning.
"In the 17th century, the Palace of Westminster was made of many buildings, spread over a large area. They were grouped around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the old royal palace. This palace housed both Parliament and the various law courts. The palace was also easier to access than it is today. Merchants, lawyers, and other people lived and worked on the palace grounds."
"As a member of the King's Bodyguard, Percy was able to lease rooms next to the House of Lords, in May 1604. The plotters' original idea was to dig their way under the foundations of the Lords chamber to put the gunpowder there. The main idea was to kill James, but many other important targets would be present, including most of the Protestant nobility and senior bishops of the Church of England. Guy Fawkes, as ""John Johnson"", was put in charge of this building, where he posed as Percy's servant. Catesby's house in Lambeth was used to store the gunpowder with the tools for digging."
"However, the Black Plague came back to London in the summer of 1604 and proved to be particularly severe. For this reason, the opening of Parliament was changed to 1605. By Christmas Eve, the miners had still not reached the buildings of Parliament, and just as they restarted work early in 1605, they learned that the opening of Parliament had been further postponed to 3 October. The plotters then took the opportunity to row the gunpowder up the Thames from Catesby's house in Lambeth, to hide it in their new rented house: they had learned (by chance) that a coal merchant named Ellen Bright had vacated a ground-floor undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords chamber. Presented with this golden opportunity, Percy immediately took pains to secure the lease. He created the story that his wife would join him in London and that he would need the extra storage space."
"Fawkes assisted in filling the room with gunpowder, which was hidden beneath a wood store under the House of Lords building, in a cellar leased from John Whynniard. By March 1605, they had filled the undercroft underneath the House of Lords with 36 barrels of gunpowder, hidden under a store of winter fuel. Had all 36 barrels been successfully ignited, the explosion could easily have reduced many of the buildings in the Old Palace of Westminster complex to rubble, and would have blown out windows in the surrounding area of about a one kilometre radius."
"The conspirators left London in May, and went to their homes or to different areas of the country, because being seen together would arouse suspicion. They arranged to meet again in September; however, the opening of Parliament was again postponed."
"Water is also used for recreational purposes, ""see list of water sports""."
Water is used as both the coolant and the neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors. This may be ordinary water (called light water in the nuclear industry) or heavy water.
"Water is also used for washing a lot of objects. Goods, services and people are transported to other countries in watercrafts on bodies of water."
Water is used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant. Water is also used in fire fighting. Water is also used for cooking.
Dihydrogen monoxide parody.
"The dihydrogen monoxide parody involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name ""dihydrogen monoxide"" (DHMO) and listing some of its harmful effects in an alarming way. Some examples include talking about how ""it causes burning, suffocation and corrosion,"" when it is actually just talking about hot water, drowning and rust. Sometimes the parody calls for it to be banned and/or labelled as dangerous."
The prank works because it takes advantage of people's misunderstanding. Calling water by an unfamiliar name and making it sound like a harmful chemical can make people think it is dangerous.
"""Dihydrogen monoxide"" is an alternative chemical name for water, but nobody uses it. The word ""dihydrogen"" means two hydrogens, and ""monoxide"" means one oxygen. The chemical formula of water has two hydrogens and one oxygen."
"The parody gained most of its popularity in the 1990s, when a 14-year-old named Nathan Zohner collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility. Zohner fooled a lot of people, which has led to his project being used in lessons about critical thinking and the scientific method."
"The website DHMO.org is a joke website which lists the harmful effects of water (DHMO), answers questions, and calls for it to be banned, among other things."
Origin of the Earth's water.
The weirdness of water.
"A BBC short item explains that every molecule on Earth has existed for billions of years, and all of them came from elsewhere. Water is alien because it arrived on asteroids and comets. It is the second most common molecule in the universe. Why is it not a gas? It is made of two very light elements. Ice floating on water is also an oddity. Also, hot water freezes faster than cold, and no-one knows why this is. Molecules of water can move up against the force of gravity (that is due to surface adhesion)."
Water in the universe.
Much of the universe's water is produced as a by-product of star formation.
"On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing ""140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined"" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the ""discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence""."
"Water has been detected in interstellar clouds in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too. Its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients."
Origin of water on Earth: Possibilities.
"We do not know exactly how the Earth came to have so much water. It is everywhere in the Universe, but it is uncommon for a place to have so much. Reasoning from first principles, every element except hydrogen has been formed in stars. Therefore, oxygen was originally formed in stars. The formation of water is not a problem: it is exothermic, so forming the molecule from its atoms does not need outside energy. But to explain why the Earth has so much compared to, for example, Mars, is not easy. It is an undecided problem in planetary geology."
"For a while, people thought Earth’s water did not come from the planet’s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was thought that water and other volatiles must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. But hydrogen inside the Earth did play some role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas may each be partly right. Water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals (asteroids) in the outer edges of the asteroid belt. How much is not known."
Water Vapor.
Water vapor is the gas form of water and is found in:
Liquid Water.
"Liquid water is found on Earth. It covers about 71% of the surface of the Earth. Liquid water is sometimes found in small amounts on Mars. Scientists believe that liquid water is in the moons Enceladus, Titan, Europa and Ganymede."
Frozen Water.
The frozen form of water (ice) is found in:
Want
"A want is a wish or a desire for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to need, which is when someone ""must"" have something."
"People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can ""need"" to eat food and can ""want"" to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer hungry) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met."
"In economics, a want is about goods or services. Choice is how to satisfy a want, when there are different ways to do this."
"Want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor, hungry or with no money. Charles Dickens wrote a famous book called ""A Christmas Carol"" in which there are two children, named Want and Ignorance."
"In 1814, Napoleon I abdicated the French throne. That freed up experienced British troops to be sent to North America. They burned the unfinished Washington, DC, and also attacked Baltimore. An American lawyer, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem about the Battle of Baltimore. The poem was later used to give the words to a song that later became the US national anthem: ""The Star Spangled Banner."" The war ended in 1815. The British attacked New Orleans but were stopped by the Americans under General Andrew Jackson."
"Unknown by both sides, a peace treaty had already been signed."
Peace.
"The two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent to end the war, on December 24, 1814 in Belgium. Fighting continued into January 1815 because the forces did not know about the treaty, but no great changes took place afterward. The British stopped impressing sailors because the Napoleonic Wars had been finished."
"Most Americans heard of the victory in the Battle of New Orleans before they heard of the treaty. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, became disliked as pro-British and soon disappeared."
Winner.
"From the British perspective, the War of 1812 was a minor sideshow. The Americans called it their victorious ""Second War for Independence"". The British remembered it as the Americans trying to take advantage of their being involved in a war against the French Empire and paid no attention to American grievances."
"In Canada, the War of 1812 was an unwanted war. It concerned the distant capitals of Washington, DC, and London, not them. In Lower Canada, now Quebec, it was considered an Anglo-Saxon war. In Quebec there was little love for the British, but the British had guaranteed their right to speak French. Since they did not know what would happen if the Americans took over, they chose the lesser evil and supported the British."
"Upper Canada (later part of the Province of Ontario) had been settled by American Loyalists who fled after the Revolutionary War. They had little love of their former countrymen in the US but had become outnumbered by Americans who later came north to settle. When the Americans attempted to invade Canada, the Canadian militias were eager to defend their homeland."
"In US history, the War of 1812 is the most obscure conflict. The average American remembers very little about the war. Some may remember The Star Spangled Banner, the Burning of Washington, or the Battle of New Orleans. Otherwise, it is a little-understood conflict. The issues are complex. Most scholars would agree it was fought over maritime issues. Since the British Navy was then the most powerful in the world, it was easier to attack the British on land by invading Canada. Former US President Thomas Jefferson predicted the ""acquisition of Canada, will be a mere matter of marching."""
"British who knew about the little war felt that they had won, no matter what Americans thought. Canadians kept their independence from the US and so felt that they had won. The Americans felt they won although they lost in Canada since they lost none of their territory, repelled the invasion of Maryland, were free to fight the Indians without British interference, and were no longer impressed on the high seas. Of all three, the British are perhaps the happiest because they have completely forgotten about the war."
Chandigarh
"Chandigarh, also called ""The Beautiful City"", is a city in India. It is a union territory, because it is the capital of two states: Punjab and Haryana. As a territory it does not belong to either state. Before 1 November,1966 it was capital of Punjab, but after formation of Haryana on 1 November, 1966 it become a union territory.There are many tourism places in Chandigarh like Rock garden, Rose garden and Sukhna lake."
"Chandigarh came into existence in 1952 when its first stone was laid. It is one of the modern cities of India, designed by a French architect Le Carbusier. It was the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Sh.Jawahar Lal Nehru."
"It is well known for its mixed cultural background and its fast development in the field of Information Technology. It has outlets of many famous multinational companies established here and is emerging as a hub for business development. The territory covers an area of 44 mi² or 114 km², it is bigger than Montserrat but smaller than Jersey. It's also the proposed capital of Khalistan."
Convection
Convection is the movement of heat because of the movement of warm matter.
"For example, atmospheric circulation moves warm air to cool places, causing wind. Wind, in turn, can enter and cool a room if the window is open. The movement of the clouds, the ocean currents and many types of heaters are examples of convection."
Forced convection and natural convection.
"Convection can happen naturally (""natural convection"") or because of a moving device (""forced convection"")."
"The fan is a device that produces the movement of the air artificially. The air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan. This is an example of ""forced convection""."
"Natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold, so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part, the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward. For example, if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire, it moves from the bottom to the surface. At the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom."
Convection currents.
"Convection currents occur when there are significant differences in temperature between two parts of a fluid. When this happens, hot fluids rise and cold fluids sink. This causes movements or currents in the fluid. Atmospheric circulation, for example, is made by convection currents."
Chipmunk
"A chipmunk is a small squirrel-like rodent. It is in the Sciuridae family. About twenty-three species fall under this title, with one species in North America."
"The name may have originally been spelled ""chitmunk"" (perhaps from a Native American word meaning ""red squirrel""). However, the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary (in 1842) as ""chipmonk"". Other early forms include ""chipmuck"" and ""chipminck""."
"Chipmunks are hoarders, meaning they store food for winter."
Popular culture.
"The lateral line detects changes in water pressure. It is open to the environment by a line of pores. This and the sound-detecting organs are grouped together as the 'acoustico-lateralis system', because they have a common origin. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost."
This system is found in other fish as well. It detects motion or vibrations in water. The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz.
Reproduction.
"About 70% of all known shark species give birth to live young, with the gestation period lasting from 6 to 22 months."
"Pups are born with a full set of teeth, and are capable of taking care of themselves. Once born, they quickly swim away from their mothers, who sometimes feed on the pups. Litters vary from one or two pups (great white shark) to one hundred pups (blue shark and whale shark)."
"Some sharks are oviparous, laying their eggs in the water. Shark eggs (sometimes called ""mermaid's purses"") are covered by a tough, leathery membrane."
"Most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, with the babies developing within the mother, but there is no placenta to nourish the pups. Instead the young feed on the egg's yolk. The pups eat any unfertilized eggs and sometimes each other. Very few pups in a litter survive until birth due to this form of sibling cannibalism. Great white sharks, mako sharks, nurse sharks, tiger sharks, and sand tiger sharks give birth this way."
"Some sharks are viviparous, meaning that the females give live birth: the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the babies are fed by a placenta. The placenta helps transfer nutrients and oxygen from the mother's bloodstream and transfers waste products from the baby to the mother for elimination. Examples of viviparous sharks include the bull sharks, the whitetip reef sharks, the lemon sharks, the blue sharks, the silvertip sharks, and the hammerhead sharks. Although long thought to be oviparous, whale sharks are viviparous, and pregnant females have been found containing hundreds of pups."
New shark discoveries.
"New sharks are still being found. Dave Ebert found ten new species in a Taiwan market. Over the past three decades he has named 24 new species. They include sharks, rays, sawfish and ghost sharks these cartilaginous fish are all related."
Fishing.
"Some sharks are not endangered, but some are hunted for food (like shark fin soup) or sport fishing. In 2013 five species of shark, along with two species of manta ray, received international protection as part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species."
"It is thought that 100 million sharks are killed by commercial and recreational fishing. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In the Australian state of Victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called ""flake"". In India, small sharks or baby sharks (called ""sora"" in Tamil and Telugu languages) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not matured (not adult), cooking the flesh breaks it into powder. The powder is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu."
Vulture
Vultures are large birds of prey that usually feed on the carrion or (dead or dying animals and rocks). Vultures use their large wings to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap. Vultures are also called buzzards.
"""Vultures"" from the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) are not related to the vultures of the New World (North and South America). They look quite similar, though. Both have heads and necks with no feathers."
"""Old World vultures"" are related to eagles and hawks and use sight to find their food. ""New World vultures"" are related to storks and use their sense of smell to find their food. Vultures symbolize death in literature."
"King vultures use rocks to open eggs, they pick up a rock with their beak and simply drop or throw the rock onto the egg and breaks it."
New World vultures is a name which is used for a number of species in the Americas. The best known of these are probably the Andean condor and the black vulture.
Eagle
"Eagle is a general term for many large birds of prey. Over 60 species have been described, and they live in many parts of the world. Most species of eagle are found in Eurasia and in Africa."
"Eagles are not a natural monophyletic group. The name describes a bird of prey big enough to hunt larger vertebrates. Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight. Eagles are generally put in the family Accipitridae. They belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related."
"The largest eagle that has ever lived is Haast's eagle. It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem. Though it is now extinct, it lived in New Zealand. Before man got there, it preyed on moas."
"Eagles are carnivores. This means that they eat meat from other animals. Eagles are birds of prey, and so are vultures, falcons and owls. Eagles use their strong talons to catch and grab their food, and they use their sharp beaks to help them tear into the meat of their prey."
Falcon
"Falcons are small to medium-sized birds of prey related to hawks, eagles, and vultures. They usually have pointed wings and long tails."
"Most falcons eat small mammals. Some species hunt other birds, which they take in flight. Like hawks, most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings, with white undersides."
"The peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 km/h (200 mi/h). It was nearly wiped out in North America by the use of pesticides, but has since made a recovery."
In some countries falcons are used in falconry. This means people catch the birds and make them hunt for them. Long ago this was a way for people to get more food but today it is a sport.
"The word ""Sputnik"" comes from the ,"
"or , not ."
Carnival
"Carnival is a public festival which takes place in many cities and towns in many countries around the world. It is in February or March each year. Carnival can sometimes last for several weeks. In some places there is only one day of celebration. There are often street parades, bands, costumes and many people wear masks. Carnival is linked to religious traditions in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and it is also linked to local customs."
Background.
Lent.
"Many Christian churches have a 40-day ""season"" of fasting called Lent, in which Christians prepare for Easter which is one of the two most important feasts in the Christian year (the other being Christmas). Easter is in late March or April. Lent always begins on a Wednesday, which is called Ash Wednesday in February or March. On that day, many people go to church and have some ash smeared on their forehead as a sign of sorrow for their sins. Then for 40 days, they try to work hard on improving themselves and thinking about the teachings of Jesus. It is usual for people to ""give up"" something for Lent. They might stop smoking or stop watching TV so they can spend more time reading the Bible or talking with the family. Many people give up all their favourite foods and have no cake, wine, beer, chocolate, ice cream or other luxury foods."
"The name ""carnivale"" comes from Italian and means ""putting aside the flesh"". This means that during Lent people were not to think about their ""flesh"" (their bodies) but do things that were good for their souls. The word ""flesh"""" also means ""meat"" so many people would eat no meat during Lent."
Mardi Gras.
"Mardi Gras means ""Fat Tuesday"". This was the day just before Lent. The first day of Lent was called Mecredi Meagre meaning ""Mean Wednesday"". (""Mean"" used to mean ""poor"" and ""thin"" rather than ""nasty"".)"
"During the Middle Ages in Europe, it was normal for people to have a big feast on the Tuesday before the Lenten fast started. In many towns this developed into a big public party, with entertainment in the town square. There is a famous painting by Pieter Bruegel dating from the 1550s and showing the ""Battle of Carnival and Lent"". (See top of page)"
About Pieter Bruegel's famous painting.
"In this picture by Pieter Bruegel, a man representing Carnival is pushed on a barrel by people in costumes and masks. He is about to do battle with Lent. His weapon is a skewer covered with pieces of roast meat. He balances a blackbird pie on his head. Lent, who is very skinny, fights him with two little fish on a bread-board. The person at the front wears a mask and plays a very noisy instrument called a ""rummelpott""."
Modern celebrations of Carnival.
"Nowadays many cities and towns around the world celebrate Carnival for a week or more. The final day of the celebration is Mardi Gras, when there is often a parade. In some cities the Mardi Gras parade is held on the weekend before Lent begins, rather than on the Tuesday, so as not to disturb the business and traffic of the town."
"In some towns such as the Belgian town of Binche the preparations for the Carnival are complex and start many weeks before Carnival takes place, with most of the town's people taking part in some way. The Carnival of Binche is listed with UNESCO as an event of great historic importance because it has been held there in almost the same way for more than 500 years."
"Carnival is celebrated differently around the world, but there are some things that are similar:"
"In the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, which is one of the biggest and most famous in the world, a major feature is the glamorous costumes as both men and women wear bright colours and wonderful headdresses to dance down the street to the sound of many bands. In Rio there are many very large and expensive decorated ""floats""."
"In New Orleans the bands are one of the most important parts of the Carnival celebrations. In Düsseldorf in Germany, one of the features of the Carnival parades are the enormous models of politicians and other well-known people. In Sydney, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras which started out as a parade for Sydney's homosexual community, now includes exhibitions, live theatre and competitions, and stretches over two weeks."
"In Venice the Carnival was celebrated from December 26 until Lent began. During that time, people were allowed to disguise themselves by wearing masks in the street. In the 1930s this was forbidden by the Italian Government, but in 1980 a mask-makers shop was set up in Venice again. Soon the old tradition was brought back, and now many people dress in costume and wear masks for two weeks before Lent begins."
"In Brussels in Belgium, the main Carnival procession is held in the Grande Place, the town square in front of the Gothic Town Hall with its huge tower. Every part of the procession is ruled by a tradition, but some of the traditions are so old that no-one remembers what they mean anymore. At the beginning of the procession is a large group of people dressed in beautiful costumes of silk and velvet, who act out an historic scene of the coming of the King of Spain and his royal court to Brussels 500 years ago. When they have taken their seats, there comes an amazing procession which includes stilt walkers, fire eaters, Goldilocks with a dancing bear, a mad camel, a wizard, lots of men in huge feathery headdresses, and the Archangel Michael whose job is to frighten the Devil. These characters are traditional to Brussels. In every city, the characters that take part are different."
Uruguay.
"The country of Uruguay in South America is a fun place to be during Carnival. In Uruguay, Carnival has its own special musical performance."
"During February and March, it is summer in Uruguay. Everybody goes into the streets, from old people to children. There are people dancing, singing, and playing a special kind of music. This kind of dance and music is called murga."
"People do murga performances in groups. The biggest groups have 17 people. They wear funny clothes with lots of colors. They play the drums and sing. The members of the groups are not professional singers or dancers. They are people with other jobs. Each group prepares and practices their own dance and songs for months. Then, they try to be the best group at the festival. Each group's dance and songs last about 45 minutes. The songs are stories about important people or events in the news, so people think watching murga is like watching a play at the theater."
"Uruguay’s Carnival started over 100 years ago. It is the world's longest and is about 40 days long. People still work during that time, but in the evenings and on weekends, they enjoy the festival."
"Different uses of the word ""carnival""."
"Although the word ""carnival"" still has its old meaning, it is often used to mean public entertainments of different kinds. Some towns have carnivals that have nothing to do with Lent and are at different times of year. Nowadays there are all sorts of different carnivals. Some of these carnivals, like the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Melbourne Cup Racing Carnival in Australia are very famous."
"The word ""carnival"" is now used for festivals, parades and competitions of all sorts. There are school sports carnivals, folk carnivals, multi-cultural carnivals, horse racing carnivals, wine and food carnivals and boating carnivals."
Fasting
Tie votes.
"Normally, appellate courts (or panels) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie vote. Sometimes and in some jurisdictions, when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused (excuse) himself or herself from the case, the court may be stuck with a tie. In this situation the decision of the lower Court stands."
Writ
"In English common law, a writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction. In modern use this generally is a court. Writs are issued by courts directing the person to whom they are addressed to do something or to not do something. Writs may also be used to direct other courts or public authorities. The authority for a court to issue a writ is given by the All Writs Act which is a United States federal statute originally a part of the Judiciary Act of 1789."
History.
"In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English king to a specified person to undertake a specified action. For example in the feudal era a military summons by the king to one of his tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with his knights at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom. Also in Canada in a writ of election. This was is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, the Governor General) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament."
Types of writs.
There have been a great many kinds of writs. Some of the more common types still in use are:
Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on March 4, 1794 and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ""Chisholm v. Georgia""."
Lawsuits against states.
"The idea of sovereign immunity originated in English common law. It was also proposed by political theorists like Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin. The founding fathers of the Constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits. Several Anti-Federalists were afraid that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits ""between a State and Citizens of another State"", would override that doctrine."
"The Eleventh Amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the Supreme Court in ""Chisholm v. Georgia"" (1793). In ""Chisholm"" the Court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against US states. Also, that states were not immune to these cases. The Eleventh Amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country. It says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state."
"In ""Ex parte Young"", the Supreme Court decision allowed suits in federal courts against officials acting on behalf of states of the union to proceed despite the State's sovereign immunity, when the State acted unconstitutionally."
The Eleventh Amendment is one of five amendments that overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions.
Johnnie Cochran
"Johnnie L Cochran, Jr. (October 2, 1937 – March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer. He is best known for his part in the acquittal of O. J. Simpson for the murder of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Cochran also represented many different celebrities and victims. Cochran became known as an early advocate for the victims of police brutality. Cochran helped Sean Combs win an acquittal after being indicted on stolen weapons charges and bribery in 2001. After the case, he decided to retire."
"On March 29, 2005, Cochran died from a brain tumor in his home in Los Angeles, aged 67."

"Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word meaning ""place of the deer."" The city was started in 1531. By the mid-1800s a large group of immigrants had arrived from Germany. These new citizens made Mazatlán into a successful commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. They also influenced the music, banda, which is an form of Bavarian folk music, and also started the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900."
"Mazatlán, with a population of 352,471 (city) and 403,888 (municipality) as of the 2005 census, is the second-largest city in the state (after Culiacán) and Mexico's largest commercial port. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry across the Gulf of California from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur exists. The municipality has a land area of 3,068.48 km² (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, El Habal and many other small villages."

Kol people
"The Kols, also known as Kolarians, are the original inhabitants of modern-day West Bengal and North-east India. The term Kol has been corrupted by the Aryan-Sanskritic speakers to the word ""kalu"", meaning both ""black"" and ""ugly"", in almost all of the 16 major languages of the subcontinent. The Kolarians are a Dravidian peoples stock group, whose descendant communities can be found also in West Bengal and elsewhere in the eastern part of the East India."
"Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the Tertiary era. Semi-recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago. A 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district. This Neo-stone age began 3,000 BC lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements."
"Physically, the indigenous peoples of eastern India were long-headed, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature. Sometimes labeled as ""Negritos"" and ""Negroids"", their physical features are unchanged today among the lowest castes of Bengal, mainly the peasants, as well as 95% of population of West Bengal today who derive from these lower castes and tribes."
Sena dynasty
"Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics, first published in 1788, was the best treatment of classical mechanics since Newton, and helped the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century."
Life.
"Lagrange's parents were Italian, although he also had French ancestors on his father's side. In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to France and became a member of the French Academy, and he remained in France until the end of his life. Therefore, Lagrange is alternatively considered a French and an Italian scientist."
Lagrange survived the French Revolution and became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794. Napoleon appointed Lagrange to the Legion of Honour and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808. Lagrange is buried in the Panthéon and his name appears as one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max (Johnny Galecki) passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never again discuss what had happened."
"A year later, Julie returns home from her college in Boston for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, ""I know what you did last summer!"" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Julie meets up with George, who is now working as a host for a children's TV show, she showed the letter to George, then Julie and George meet up with Charlotte, who now works at a video store.

He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car."
"Meanwhile, Julie, Charlotte and George researches newspaper articles which lead them to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen, George, Charlotte and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy (Anne Heche) at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off her hair while she sleeps, and writes ""Soon"" in lipstick on her vanity mirror."
"The following morning, Julie, Charlotte and George find Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of their car. When Julie calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Charlotte, George, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie and George. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie and George realise it was not a suicide note, but a death threat."
"At the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry and Charlotte being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry or Charlotte. A police officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson) is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade."
"Julie and George find an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis (Muse Watson), and realise that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She and George then go to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe them. Julie and George notice Ray's boat is called Billy Blue and run away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites both Julie and George to hide on his boat. On the boat, they find photos and articles about their friends and them, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie and George, chasing them below deck; there, they uncover the bodies of Helen, Charlotte and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie and George. He ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile."
"A year later, both Julie and George are in college in Boston. As Julie enters the shower, she notices the words ""I still know"" on the mirror. Moments later, a dark figure crashes through it as Julie screams in horror."

Ratifying conventions have only been used on one occasion. This was in 1933 and was used to ratify the 21st Amendment. All other proposed constitutional amendments have been offered to the state legislatures for ratification.
"The Constitution also provides that state ratifying conventions may also be used to propose a constitutional amendment. However, to date, none of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by state conventions. A state ratifying convention may be called by a two-thirds vote by a state legislature."

Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Validated on December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution canceled the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and ended the Prohibition Era in the United States. It is the only Amendment to repeal another amendment. It is also the only Amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures."
Background.
"The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had started a period in the US known as Prohibition. During this time the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement. but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime had soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol. The federal government was unable to enforce the Volstead Act. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time. This was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933, it chose the ""other"" ratification method established by Article V. That is by state conventions."
Implementation.
State and local control.
"The second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages. Many U.S. states still remained ""dry"" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until 1966. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments have tried to revoke liquor licenses."
Ritz Crackers
Ritz Crackers are a brand of snack cracker. They were introduced by Nabisco in 1934. They are disc-shaped and lightly-salted.
"Ritz Crackers varieties include the Original Ritz, Low Sodium Ritz, Honey Butter Ritz, Whole Wheat Ritz and Honey Wheat Ritz."
"Sydney Stern chose the name Ritz. The name appealed to people who went through the difficulties of the Great Depression by offering them ""a bite of the good life."""
Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS
"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus caused by AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. However, the world is committed to preventing new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. In 2019, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, since 2010, the number of new HIV infections fell by 23%. For example, in one year, this is different from the number of people diagnosed with HIV in one year. Worldwide, about 81 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status in 2019. The remaining 19% (about 710 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. Important way HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services."
HIV/AIDS pandemic by continent.
Africa.
"HIV/AIDS is a major concern epidemic in Africa and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent contains about 15.2% of the world's population, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 69% of HIV patients, and 70% of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the North African countries have the lowest prevalence rates, as their populations usually share cultural patterns that reduce the spread of the disease, in contrast to what the desert countries did in Africa. Southern Africa is the most affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10% of the population in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
Europe.
"AIDS cases in most countries in Western Europe have fallen to levels not seen since the initial outbreak; many people attribute this trend to active education campaigns, blood transfusion screening and increased condom use. In addition, since new AIDS treatments have proven to be effective (even if expensive) methods to suppress HIV, Western Europe’s AIDS mortality rate has also fallen very much in the past few years. There are many ways to transmit HIV, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drugs, mother-to-child behavior, and heterosexual behavior. However, many new infections in this area have occurred through contact with HIV-infected people in other areas. The prevalence of adults (15-49 years old) in the region is 0.3%, and there are currently 570,000 to 890,000 HIV-infected persons. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths from AIDS has remained low since the trough in the late 1990s. However, in some countries, there is still a large number of undiagnosed HIV, and the evidence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in some newly infected people in the region is worrying. In addition, the risky behaviors of men who come into contact with men have recently increased."
Asia.
"As of 2008, 4.7 million people in Asia were infected with HIV. The United Nations believes that the epidemic in Asia peaked in the mid-1990s, and that the annual rate of HIV infection subsequently decreased by more than half. Regionally, the epidemic has remained fairly stable since the 2000s."
North America.
"In 2016, it was estimated that 1.5 million adults and children were infected with HIV / AIDS in North America, excluding Central America and the Caribbean. 70,000 adults and children are newly infected each year, with an adult prevalence rate of 0.5%. 26,000 people die of AIDS in North America each year."
South America.
"At the beginning of 2018, there are almost about 1 million people living with HI /AIDS in South America. By the number of its population, Brazil is the country with the most HIV-positive people with 830,000 people. As of April 2018, Chile is the country with the most infections. While the Falkland Islands are the only territory where no cases were detected. The biggest problem that exists is discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in less developed countries. This is due to ignorance of the disease, with outdated premises and the high religious population by influenced to other people."
Oceania.
"In this region, the national conditions regarding HIV and AIDS vary greatly. Part of the reason is the distance between the major islands in Oceania. The extensive development of the region also plays an important role.

Papua New Guinea is one of the worst AIDS epidemic in the region. According to UNAIDS, since 1997, HIV cases in the country at a rate of 30% per year, by the end of 2006, HIV prevalence in the country is about 1.3% from the population."
Sybil (cat)

Baba Fingo
Baba Fingo or Father Fingo is a male Deity in Turkish Romani folklore. The Romanlar in Turkey believe in Baba Fingo as their Saviour. The festival Kakava is celebrated at Edirne on 5-6 May. The Romanlar make a Bonfire and go to the Meric River in the night. They believe Baba Fingo comes out of the water and protects the Romani people.
"The legend of Baba Fingo says that long ago, the people lived in Egypt. But the Pharaoh was cruel to them. So Baba Fingo led the people out through the Red Sea. Another legend says that Baba Fingo was a good and wise commandant who worked for Pharaoh, but he liked women and alcohol too much. The Pharaoh's other commandants were jealous of him. They tricked him with women and alcohol and he got lost in the river. Although the Romanlar have been quasi-Muslims for centuries, the popular Folk belief in Baba Fingo plays a very important role for them."
"Language revival tries to save a language that is dead or endangered. The Hebrew language was once a language that was not spoken, but the language was revived, and people now speak and use it again. Many people are now trying to revive their languages. The revival of languages is good, beautiful, and useful."

Objectivity (science)
"Objectivity in science means that scientific ideas and measurements are tested. That means they are independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them. In other words, if scientist A claims something, scientist B must be able to check whether A is right."
"The evidence can (in principle) be shown to anyone who doubts it. The ""in principle"" bit is because some science needs complex machinery, and if you don't understand the machinery, you won't understand the results. But elementary science can often be shown in a classroom, or on television."
"Some science does need a proper scientific education. To some extent the general public has to trust a qualified scientist to present the idea in some suitable form. That means on television or on the web, or perhaps in published articles or books. Most awards of the Nobel Prize in science are followed by presentations on various web channels."
"It is generally agreed that, at least in some subjects, modern science needs a person to have some education before they can understand it. Specialist communicators often do this on television or the web. 150 years ago, people read science directly from books written by scientists like Faraday and Darwin. Now most people get their science from people who act as communicators of science."
Objectivity in measurement.
"To avoid the variety in subjective (ambiguous) interpretation of quantifying terms such as ""green"", ""hot"", ""large"", ""considerable"", and ""negligible"", scientists try hard, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standardized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc.) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc.) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use ""hard"", ""objective"" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would get the same results."
Roundhay Garden Scene
"Roundhay Garden Scene is a short movie made on October 14, 1888 in the garden of ""Oakwood Grange"", Roundhay, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was made by a French man named Louis Le Prince. It was silent. The movie had Adolphe Le Prince, Sarah Whitley, Joseph Whitley, and Harriet Hartley walking in the garden of Oakwood Grange. It is believed to be the oldest surviving movie by many people. It is 1.66 seconds long. The digitalized version lasts 2.11 seconds."
Herpetology
"Herpetology is the branch of zoology concerned with reptiles and amphibians. It is about cold-blooded animals like salamanders, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, tuataras and crocodilians."
Herp.
"""Herp"" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term ""herpetile"". Linnaeus grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles."
Batrachology.
Batrachology is the study of amphibians. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite pets.

2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by tsunami waves. It was measured at 8.4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale The earthquake happened off Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, on the east coast of the Tōhoku of Japan, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC. It was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles). It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history. It was also the fourth most powerful earthquake on Earth since modern record-keeping began in 1900."
"On 10 February 2015, the Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing."
Earthquake.
"Days before the main earthquake, there were several foreshocks. The biggest one was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 9 March, about from the main earthquake's location."
The United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was from Tokyo. A 7.7 aftershock happened 30 minutes following the first quake. There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 4.5 or more.
"The earthquake damaged buildings and started fires. The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake. Various train services around Japan were also stopped. Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami, affecting many people. A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara, Chiba prefecture."
"The nuclear power plants shut down automatically. At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked. About 51,000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed. There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown."
Tsunami.
"The earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japan's Pacific coast and other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands (USA) and Taiwan. The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale. It warned that the wave could be as much as 10 meters high. A 0.5 meter high wave hit Japan's northern coast. Kyodo news agency reported a four-metre-high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Miyagi Prefecture was flooded, with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland. In some areas the waves reached 10 km inland."
"At 9:28 p.m (HST) the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7 a.m. for all of Hawaii. Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 2:59 am local time. A wave two meters high reached California, after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500 kilometres per hour. A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave."
Effects.
Deaths–Injured–Missing.
"The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing across 18 prefectures, as well as over 126,000 buildings damaged or destroyed."
Nuclear disaster.
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011, just hours after the initial wave. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped. The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved."
"There were 4.4 million households that had their electricity supply cut off, including 11 nuclear power plants."
Geophysical impact.
"The quake moved parts of northeast Japan as much as closer to North America, making parts of Japan's land ""wider than before,"" according to geophysicist Ross Stein. Areas of Japan closest to the epi-center shifted the most."
"The Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to . Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as , covering an area some long by wide. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake."
"According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass."
"The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude."
Transport.
"The Tōhoku Expressway, which serves northern Japan, had to be closed due to cracks on the roads. The whole railway network was closed, but was reopened hours after the earthquake. Up to 100,000 people were stuck waiting for a ride straight out of the city."
Television broadcast.
"In response to the great disaster, Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast. This was the first time any emperor had used television in this way."
Other help.
"There were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster. For example, Google set up a people finder service, which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people."

Article Five of the United States Constitution
Article Five of the United States Constitution outlines how the Constitution can be changed. Changes to the Constitution are called Constitutional amendments.
"Article Five also says that there are certain clauses, or parts, of Article One of the Constitution that could not be amended right away. These clauses are explained in the ""Protected clauses"" section."
Background.
"Before the Constitution was approved, the United States was covered by its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation."
"Under the Articles of Confederation, amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures. Not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment. If a single state Senator or Representative in the country disagreed with an amendment, the amendment would fail. This made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed."
"When the Founding Fathers wrote Article Five, they were trying to make sure changing the Constitution was not too hard, but not too easy either. James Madison later explained that the amendment process in the Constitution ""guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults."""
"In Simple English, Madison meant that the amendment process protects equally against:"
Step 1: Proposing an amendment.
There are two steps in the process for changing the Constitution. The first step is proposing (formally suggesting) an amendment. Article Five of the Constitution allows this to be done in two different ways.
"The first way is the most common way. Any member of Congress can suggest an amendment. However, two-thirds (67%) of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives have to agree that the amendment is needed. If this happens, the proposed amendment moves to Step 2 in the process."
"As of 2020, the second way has never been used. However, it exists to protect the rights of the state legislatures. If two-thirds of the state legislatures ask them to, Congress has to call a Constitutional Convention. Delegates would come to the Convention from each state. The Constitutional Convention could propose as many amendments as they wanted to. All of the amendments they proposed would move to Step 2 in the process."
"At first, when the Founding Fathers were writing the Constitution, they were only going to give Congress the power to propose amendments. However, some of the Founders, like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, worried that this gave Congress too much power. Madison and Hamilton re-wrote Article Five to add the second option for proposing an amendment, and the rest of the Founders agreed. Adding the second option helped make sure the states had power too the power to propose amendments if enough of their legislatures agreed."
Step 2: Ratifying the amendment.
"Step 2 starts when an amendment has been proposed, either by Congress or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment now has to be ratified. Like with Step 1, Article Five gives two choices for how an amendment can be ratified. Congress gets to choose which way to use."
"Congress has almost always chosen the first way: letting the state legislatures ratify the amendment. If three-fourths (75%) of the state legislatures ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"The second option is for Congress to ask each state to create a ""ratifying convention."" This is a group of people not members of the state legislature who would decide whether or not to ratify the amendment. If ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"Congress has only used the second option once: after it proposed the 21st Amendment. (This amendment cancelled the 18th Amendment, which made alcohol illegal in the United States. The 21st Amendment made alcohol legal again.)"
"At the time, Congress thought that this would be the more democratic option. A large majority of the people in the United States wanted the 21st Amendment to pass. However, Congress thought the state legislators would refuse to pass the amendment because of pressure from powerful groups that were against alcohol. In other words, Congress did not think that the state legislatures would vote the way the people of the United States would want. This example shows why the Founding Fathers included the ""ratifying convention"" option in the amendment process. If the state legislatures get too powerful, or do not represent what the people who elected them want, the people have the power to pass amendments too."
but it's something like that.
"Yeah,"
years ago.
"They sort of move up to levels,"
"and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,"
"and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that."
Oh.
So you can guess the rest of the plot.
"It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives."
"Oh, yeah."
And then defend it.
And that's pretty good actually.
"Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then."
Yeah.
And it's
you actually have to go up there
"and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,"
"a defense and a prosecution,"
"and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,"
"and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know."
"It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,"
and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.
"So,"
"It's funny,"
"we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess."
Yeah.
"And it kind of makes you wonder,"
"I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication."
"It's the behavioral science part of communication,"
Right.
"Do you know, I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the, uh, the small Coke bottles."
Yeah.
And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
"I,"
"well that's interesting because,"
"they're back to glass, you're saying?"
"They were glass, they were the glass, uh,"
"well, let's see,"
"they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. Sort of a small size, sort of a small size and, and we, anyway we just, we didn't stop and look them, look at them a long time"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"but, and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, you know, uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing."
Uh-huh.
The carton. The paper carton.
"Right,"
"right,"
"so, I hadn't seen that in a long time."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean the,"
"you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do, we were doing"
"and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles."
"And, and, uh, uh, I'm not really say going back to good old days,"
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well,"
"Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, like on the, uh, grass, I'm, I know your husband, uh, doesn't really like the paper sacks."
"No,"
he doesn't like the paper sacks
"and, uh, but he, but, you know, he likes to pick the grass up, too."
"He doesn't, Doesn't,"
uh
I mean now
"no,"
"probably, well,"
"you probably wouldn't have,"
"I might,"
"the problem is I'm really into cars,"
"and so it's not a, uh,"
"for me it's, it's a real, it's a real consideration, uh, uh,"
"and, and, uh, the,"
but no
I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars
"it's, it's probably my main hobby."
Right
"because you always think,"
"I mean, I don't know,"
"maybe you don't,"
"but just like me, I always think well, you know, these things must be safe,"
"but that's just like,"
"I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago, they said, you know, before they had the, like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist?"
Yeah.
"All these people were,"
"and, and it, it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTY-TWENTY"
Uh-huh.
"these people were like paralyzed,"
"and because, it threw them forward,"
"but they were hooked at the waist,"
"and so it like, you know, did something to their spinal cord"
Yeah.
then they were like paraplegics.
"yeah,"
"you know, ROAD AND TRACK had a, had some articles on,"
"Well, I'm, uh, I, I was just, uh, in high school I guess when it, when it ended."
Uh-huh.
"Ended up being,"
"I was in the last, last lottery."
Yeah.
And I was glad it was over by then.
Right.
I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.
"Just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like."
Yeah.
"You know, we, uh,"
"those people that I know,"
"I work with several that were over there,"
"and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday,"
I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods
"and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles"
"and then they'd, come back"
and you know.
But that they weren't really allowed to do anything.
"I, uh,"
to me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway.
"Yeah,"
it's funny.
"Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin."
"And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war"
"and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh,"
I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they're certainly all leaders"
"and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them."
Yeah.
"And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it."
"Yeah,"
that makes sense.
Um.
"Because you start prying in people's private lives, you ruin their lives as well as,"
That's right.
"And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, sometimes, I don't know"
Uh-huh.
I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.
I mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician.
"I, I, I agree with that and, uh, and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then, uh, then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
"And, uh you when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"The, that's, that's the thing that,"
"uh, things that you don't know uh, do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"People could say, oh, they do it,"
"so, I guess, you know,"
"but, as soon as things do get public uh, there, there is that terrible concern."
Uh-huh.
Um
"So, sometimes I ask myself, what are, uh, people doing that are in the media when somebody, you know, comes up to office,"
Uh-huh.
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.
I do desktop publishing at work
and I have a machine at home
and I belong to the user's group
"and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out."
Yeah?
All right.
"But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry."
I don't work a computer company.
No?
I'm an abuser.
"Well, that's, that's all right."
"But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen."
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer"
"and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,"
"let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,"
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what baud rate do you get?
"Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred"
"So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city?"
"Is it, uh,"
"Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad."
"Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things."
"Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day."
"Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck."
"Oh, really."
"But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida"
Uh-huh.
That would be a really good thing to do.
"That would be a, a really good thing to do."
So it's
"I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,"
Huh.
"and what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight"
and he ran into the motorcycle.
Huh.
"But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle."
He was just taking it home from the place.
"It was brand new,"
and his brakes did not work.
For goodness sakes.
"And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady"
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
Uh-huh.
and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.
"Oh, they saw the husband,  get,"
That's right.
They were following him home from the motorcycle shop.
Yeah.
"And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other."
"Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,  of a settlement,"
Uh-huh.
They would find something wrong with it.
"Until finally they won and,  said that it was the drunk driver's fault"
Did they really?
Uh-huh.
"but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,"
That is a shame.
"You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,  to, to also, uh, make statements,"
Right.
"but they are, they'll take any T I non-credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something.
Uh-huh.
And she's doing it.
"I mean, it's not like, it's like."
Does she have to pay to have it refinanced?
I think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the T I to be part of the credit union.
Uh-huh.
"T I to,"
"See,"
we got ripped off buying our new car.
"We both come out of, uh, drugs and stuff,"
and we became Christians about five years ago.
"Right when he got home from Terrell. Right before he got hired for T I, he had gotten saved and stuff,"
"and so, I mean, when you get come out of drugs and stuff, you have nothing,"
"I mean, you know, you don't have anything."
"You have the clothes on your back,"
"and you might have a car, and that kind of thing."
"And so, when he, when he started working at T I, we, uh, you know, we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas."
"But we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years,"
and we were young
and we'd look about nineteen.
"People still think we're about,"
"they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff, both of us."
"And so, it's just kind of strange, you know,"
"so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs, you know."
Yeah.
"So we went in, and the financed the car for five,"
"and, uh, it's, it's interesting."
"Yeah,"
that would be.
I usually vote.
"A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,"
Uh-huh.
"so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote."
Right.
"There for a while, that would, that worked."
"We've, uh, I know I have, um,"
"I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy"
Yeah.
"or, you know, they're both just as bad,"
"and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party,"
"and, um, but"
yeah.
"You know, that's not the best way"
"but,"
"No,"
I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
"But it gets to the point where,"
"I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for."
"Right,"
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
"Right,"
"or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous."
Yeah.
"I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections."
Yeah.
"I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know,"
"I'm not with you so far,"
"Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up."
I'll remember the name.
"But, uh, anyway, that was a French movie"
Uh-huh.
"it was, um, that was the last one I saw downtown,"
"but I live in D C well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown"
"Oh, yeah."
"but, uh, so this, uh, French I guess are into the"
"I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too."
"They have, they have a"
Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated of sophisticated American everywhere.
Right.
"But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy,"
"and there's something about it that's so innovative, you know,"
"he'll have trouble picking up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something,"
"but there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,"
there's something about the human character in it
"Oh, uh-huh."
"and that's what I find lacking in a lot of, you know, like HOME ALONE."
There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying
Right.
"and there was a lot of human character there,"
"but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature"
Uh-huh.
Right.
does that make since to you?
"Yeah,"
"uh-huh,"
"Well, I sort of,"
"one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working all, you know, sort of half student, half working and source of income and stuff,"
Uh-huh.
so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, I couldn't, you couldn't do it otherwise."
"Oh, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges"
"and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts,"
"I mean you could have, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I think if there's any major piece of advice I'd give, is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt."
Yeah.
"It's not,"
"I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a, a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college."
Exactly.
"So, it's, it's really kind of crazy."
"It's, it's staggering when you think that, just here in central New York, is, uh,"
"Hamilton College is just a few miles south of, you know, maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now."
Really?
A year.
Huh.
"At just a small,"
"I mean they, they, they are it is a select, college."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
I know.
"I was actually, I I was thinking of trying to get a job there"
I heard of it.
"Oh, yeah."
"But, you're talking incredible tuitions now."
Uh-huh.
"And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern."
"There's always something, no matter how young,"
and then that helps develop that attitude.
"Um, I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more."
"You know, I think this is certainly a possible way, um, to handle it"
"but I wish,"
that's something that I think that has been lost in families
and I think that's a good place to start again.
Yeah.
"I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for anybody else."
Yeah.
"And I do think, um, the schools,"
"if you're trying to do something, even with food drives"
"and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both,"
I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, that's, uh,"
"gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas"
"and, uh  it's,"
That's probably true.
That's probably true.
"I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young"
but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia  area every year.
Uh-huh.
They've done this for fourteen years now.
"Oh, that's great."
"Um, and it is, it's, uh,"
"and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close."
"Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it really,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And they
"usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home"
Uh-huh.
"and my future, future sister-in-law's mother does that too, full-time."
"Well in Plano though the problem is, you find,"
and this is what I found with Emily.
"I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area."
Uh-huh.
And I kept finding neighbors and friends
and they'd move.
Oh.
She ended up being in a different home every year.
Too transit.
Uh-huh.
And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
And her surroundings.
"So this year I, I tried Kinder-Care"
"and, then she's old enough to"
Okay.
"Well, let's see,"
"well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics"
"and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full."
I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
"Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?"
"No,"
"no,"
I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
"Well, maybe they don't."
"I, I know that was supposed to be in May"
"and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were."
Yeah.
"And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it."
Yeah.
"But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable."
"I don't,"
a lot of that's that recyclable steel
and I don't know anybody that takes that.
"Yeah,"
that's true .
my husband likes Pepsi
"and those cans are steel instead of aluminum,"
"so we can't, can't ever recycle them."
I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
"Um, now I didn't know that,"
"cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles."
"Yeah,"
"that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler"
Yeah.
"But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling."
Okay.
It was good talking to you.
Okay.
"Uh, bye."
"All right,"
bye-bye. voice said what's that
"voice said, where were they"
There you go.
What do you think invades your privacy? heavily
"Oh, well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. You know, that, that try to sell you the newspaper, and, uh, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair"
"And enough,"
"well I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, uh, junk mail and, because, um, you just end up throwing it away most of the time."
"Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need."
"Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
Oh really?
I kind of like that system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"That's, that's not a bad system."
"But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit."
Yeah.
"But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in."
Yeah.
Right.
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.
exactly.
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.
"Right,"
exactly.
Insurance cases and things like that.
Yeah.
Where
"and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them  or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering"
Uh-huh
Exactly
exactly.
"So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government"
"but,"
Have you had that experience recently?
"Recently, I can't really say recently."
"But I think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta, Georgia."
"I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. These, like these juice machines"
"and, uh  the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay"
"Oh, yeah."
"but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting  uh, after,"
"and, well, my little girl goes to tap dance,"
and my little one goes to preschool
"and, um, I'm home with the children, just do a lot of running around."
"It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type, I don't know, life."
"Um, what about you?"
"I'm, I'm single,"
"and I, I live in a town home here in Raleigh,"
Uh-huh.
and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"we, we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes,"
Uh-huh.
"and at the time that I bought this one it was just a, a much better arrangement for me personally."
I'm not home a lot.
"I travel a great deal with my job,"
Uh-huh.
and so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance.
Was sort of maintenance free.
Yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
"well, um, that, that sounds, that sounds pretty good for"
"I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much now, but to, um, maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds,"
"and it's a lot of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it."
It's
It certainly is.
"sometimes I think, um, it would be nice to have a town home, with not having all that responsibility."
"Well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear."
"I, that's the main thing when I was shopping for one,"
"I wanted to make sure I could, I couldn't hear my neighbors"
and that was
Right.
uh-huh
"And, uh, it, if, uh, no matter what they do in the, the classroom, if they go home at night and, you know, it's all totally undone, uh."
Uh-huh.
"The, the thing that, uh, uh, that Karen, my wife, has, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,"
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"these people somehow manage to, uh, you know, push on through and are successful."
"Progress,"
uh-huh.
"It's, uh, unfortunately probably what, maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that."
"Yeah,"
"not, not even that much probably."
"Well, that would be, be at the absolute most."
Yeah
uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know, those, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are, are real trouble,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I wonder whether that's just a, uh, uh, a part of the system, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"if, you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, uh, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there, there's an inefficiency there,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and you've got to let those, you know, those,"
"And speaking, speaking of doing what you want, uh, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one, um, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even, even something as simple as staying up late, um, watching television late, um, going out late, start dating,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Uh-huh.
"you start dating too early, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"just little things like that, that do start in the home,"
Yeah.
"Oh, I see."
"Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a residential area."
Um.
"And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know,"
"this dog, being a small dog it's, uh, more you, more acceptable"
Yeah
"but again,"
it's not that big of a problem.
"With Domino, she was full grown,"
I would estimate seventy pounds.
Yeah.
"And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town,"
it's a suburb of Orlando
Uh-huh.
"but there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around,"
"and she was a dog that loved to run,"
"so that was the biggest problem I saw,"
"and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around,"
"or, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats."
"Me and cats don't get along too well, uh"
"but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns."
"It's like, uh,"
"there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,"
"but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"that, that,"
"and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise."
"Sure,"
"and that's all part of of keeping your part of the relationship. You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh, those issues."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law teaches at, uh, Northern Illinois University"
"and they were in China, here a couple of years ago,"
"and he was over there at, uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching ..."
"So, uh, describe your family budget."
"Well, I've, uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one,"
"and, uh, just recently, uh, we, we set up a budget,"
"and, and we're trying to stick to it."
We just bought a new house.
"So we've got everything, you know, pretty much we know what our, uh, our fixed expenses are per month,"
"and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range,"
"and then, uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about,"
"and that's, that's the food"
"Well, yeah,"
"and to some extent, utilities, I imagine."
"well, the utilities are pretty much,"
"you can pretty much figure what they're going to be,"
and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you.
"They have that to some extent here,"
but it's not quite as good.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, transportation expenses,"
I guess you own a car.
Yes
sir.
And you know how much you're going to drive every week?
"Well, I used to, um, I used to know, uh, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, uh, nine tenths of a mile from work."
Huh.
"So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day to and from work."
So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.
"But now I've just bought a new house,"
"and I'm a half hour,"
"And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money."
"As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars."
Yep.
Right.
"And it was just,"
"I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,"
Yeah.
"so. So it gives you idea that,"
Yeah.
Definitely
I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
"Sure,"
sure.
"So,"
"I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think."
Than we think.
Sure.
Sure.
"But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure."
Uh-huh.
It sure is.
"The, you know, as far as,"
I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days
"and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing"
"but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this,"
and it was something more than just the conferences.
"They were using it as eating out, uh,"
"when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress."
Uh-huh.
"Well,"
"and, yeah,"
"and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person"
"and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know."
"But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there."
"It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get"
"so,"
"Well, that's for sure."
"Which is the same,"
"but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,"
"that's,"
"Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, just in this size of organization,"
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.
Where do you live?
I live in San Antonio.
San Antonio!
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, I live in Garland"
"and we're just beginning to,"
"we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable"
Uh-huh.
"but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're really not full, full force into it,"
"but they're trying,"
"so we're attempting it,"
but I wish we could do more.
"Yeah,"
"there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio."
I used to work for the power company here
"Yeah,"
"so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it."
"Sure,"
"because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,"
"and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas,"
All right.
I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
"Which is movies,"
correct?
That is correct.
Okay.
Are you a movie buff?
"Um, yeah."
I don't like going to see them in the theaters
"but outside of that, rent a lot,"
watch them on T V mostly.
"I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,"
"or,"
"Right,"
"well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government."
"I just, you know,"
"I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,"
"and you're out, you know."
"I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,"
"but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it."
"Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much."
Yeah.
"I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more."
"And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money."
Yeah.
"Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here"
and you
"Yeah,"
"it, it's amazing."
"There's, uh, there's a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,"
"her, her father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman."
"And the, uh, the guy, that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death, you know, he's been on death row for like eight years."
Yeah.
"And, you know, this, this was her father, uh, you know, that, that got killed, you know, just cold-blooded murder, him and three other people,"
"and, but still, for some reason, you know, this, this guy's sentence has not been carried out, you know,"
"he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people,"
"and the State still can't bring itself to, to execute, this guy."
"To, yeah, to carry it out."
It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.
"It does,"
"it really does, you know."
"She, and they have to go back, uh,"
"occasionally, you know, she has to write letters to the parole board and, you know, lawyers,"
"and just, just ever so often she mentions, well, she's got to do something else, you know, write another letter, or do something."
Yeah.
"It's just,"
It should be over and done with.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, she should be getting on with her life, you know, getting, getting that part behind her,"
"but yet, it's, it's kind of tied to her the way it is now."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"And she winds up being a, a victim, day after day after day."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
right.
"A victim,"
"not only of, indirectly of the crime, but also indirectly by that, indirect involvement."
"Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling."
Uh-huh.
"We don't, we don't do enough."
I know we don't so
"Uh, although lately I've been, uh,"
a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit
"and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does"
"and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups"
and I don't do that anymore.
"I don't know why,"
"I just don't I just, just from socializing with her"
so.
"How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?"
"Is,"
"It really, it, there's not a whole lot,"
there really isn't.
"Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,"
"they're, they're given three baskets"
Uh-huh.
and they put them out on a certain day of the week
Right.
"and each, uh, home does participate"
"but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything."
"And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense."
Oh.
Right.
"Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to."
"But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off."
That's what I do.
"Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
= = = Convoy HX 112 = = =
"HX 112 was a North Atlantic convoy of the HX series which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. It was notable in that it saw the loss of U-boats commanded by two of the Kriegsmarine's (KM) foremost U-boat aces, with ""Korvettenkapitän"" Otto Kretschmer (POW) and with ""Kapitänleutnant"" Joachim Schepke (KIA)."
"HX 112 was an east-bound convoy of ships which sailed from Halifax on 1 March 1941, making for Liverpool with war materials. Many of the ships in HX 112 were tankers carrying fuel oil to Britain."
"It was escorted by 5th Escort Group which consisted of two destroyers, and and two corvettes, and was led by Commander Donald Macintyre of HMS ""Walker"". 5th Escort Group was reinforced on this occasion by an additional two destroyers, in view of the importance of the cargo, and met the convoy as it entered the Western Approaches."
"On 15 March 1941 HX 112 was sighted by commanded by Fritz-Julius Lemp, who sent in a sighting report and commenced shadowing the convoy. He was joined throughout the day by four other boats; ""U-99"" (Kretschmer) ""U-100"" (Schepke) (Clausen) and (Kentrat)."
"On the night of 15th/16th the attack started; ""U-100"" was able to torpedo a tanker, which burst into flames, but survived to reach port; all other attacks that night were frustrated by the activities of the escorts."
"Keeping up with the convoy on the surface during the day, the pack tried again as night fell on the 16th."
"""U-99"" managed to penetrate the convoy from the north, on its port side, and sank four tankers and a freighter in under an hour. Remaining with the central column of the convoy she sank another freighter 15 minutes later before making her getaway."
"Meanwhile, the escorts, searching for U-boats outside the convoy perimeter, found ""U-100"" around 1.30am moving in on the surface. She dived, but ""Walker"" attacked with a depth charge pattern at close range. ""U-100"" evaded further damage, and surfaced, to be sighted and rammed by ""Vanoc"" just after 3am; Schepke was killed when ""Vanoc"" smashed into his periscope structure and ""U100"" went down with most of her crew."
"As this was happening, ""U-99"" was making her escape; she nearly collided with a destroyer in the dark and dived. Picked up on ASDIC by ""Walker"", she was depth-charged and severely damaged. Saving ""U-99"" from being crushed as she sank deeper and deeper, Kretschmer brought her to the surface, where she was fired on by the encircling warships. ""U-99"" was sunk, but Kretschmer and most of his crew were saved, to be taken prisoner."
There were no further attacks on HX.112 and the convoy arrived in Liverpool on 20 March.
"A total of 41 merchant vessels joined the convoy, either in Halifax or later in the voyage."
A series of armed military ships escorted the convoy at various times during its journey.
"HX.112 had lost six ships totalling 50,000 tons. However, the loss of two of the Kriegsmarine's U-boat aces, one of which was the highest scoring submarine commander of the Second World War, was a severe blow to the Kriegsmarine offensive. The defence of HX.112, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy OB 293 and the loss of U-boat ace Günther Prien along with his sub the previous week, marked a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."
= = = The Return of Count Yorga = = =
"The Return of Count Yorga (originally titled Yorga Returns) is a 1971 American vampire horror film directed by Bob Kelljan and starring Robert Quarry. It is the sequel to the 1970 film ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"The story features Quarry returning as the infamous vampire Count Yorga, along with his servant Brudah, both of whom have been revived by the supernatural Santa Ana winds. Actor Roger Perry, who had a lead role in the first film, appears again but as a different character."
"Cynthia Nelson (Mariette Hartley), a teacher at the local orphanage, talks with a pastor while watching the sun set before getting ready for a fundraising costume party. Cynthia mentions the ""Santa Ana winds"" which the pastor states are an evil omen. One of the orphans, Tommy (Philip Frame), wanders into the nearby cemetery where he faintly hears a voice ordering ""Rise, rise; it is time."" Tommy initially dismisses it, but as he stops to rest, vampire women rise from their graves. Seeing this, Tommy tries to escape the cemetery only to run into the clutches of Count Yorga (Robert Quarry), who is waiting for them."
"Sometime later, Yorga goes to the orphanage during their costume party and fund raiser. Biting one of the pretty guests, Mitzi (Jesse Welles), outside the event room before going inside and introducing himself to those present, among which is Cynthia whom he becomes infatuated with. When a weakened Mitzi stumbles into the room, he leaves as the others are attending to her. That night, he returns to his manor and a makeshift throne room overlooking several coffins, greeted by Brudda (Edward Walsh), Yorga's hulking facially disfigured valet, and the female vampires from earlier ready to do his bidding. Yorga sends the undead women to Cynthia's house, using mind-control to get Cynthia's family (along with Tommy, who was sleeping over) into the living room before his brides break in and attack them. The family is quickly overrun with Cynthia's mother, father and sister, Ellen (Karen Ericson), fed upon by the undead horde. Tommy is untouched, showcasing he is under Yorga's power while Cynthia herself is subdued, but unharmed and carried by the brides to Yorga's residence where she awakens. Due to Yorga's hypnotic suggestions, she has no memory of the attack. Yorga tells Cynthia that there was a car accident and she was left in his care by her family. He tries to charm the young woman into willingly becoming his bride, though he is warned by his live-in witch that Cynthia will bring his end if he does not kill her or turn her into a vampire soon."
"The next morning, Jennifer (Yvonne Wilder), the Nelsons' mute maid, finds the massacre scene and calls the police. However, as she does, Brudda drags the corpses of Cynthia's mother and father to a quicksand pit on Yorga's property, disposing of the physical evidence. By the time the police arrive though, all of the evidence has been mysteriously cleared away, and Tommy claims that nothing has happened. Despite the confusion, David Baldwin (Roger Perry), Cynthia's fiancé, is suspicious about the Nelsons' disappearance. Meanwhile, memories of the attack on her family slowly start to resurface in Cynthia's mind as she stays within Yorga's manor. Jennifer, suspicious about Tommy's involvement with the Nelson's disappearance and his visits to Yorga's mansion, loses her patience and slaps Tommy who stares at her in a vengeful manner. Meanwhile, Yorga goes to claim Mitzi, killing her boyfriend near their boat house before feeding on her once more, this time finishing draining her completely and adding her to his vampiric harem."
"Hours later, Ellen's fiancé Jason (David Lampson) is lured to Yorga's mansion by Tommy, on the claim that he found Ellen. Once at the mansion, Tommy disappears, while Jason is reunited with Ellen who has clearly been made into a vampire by Yorga. As she mocks him for ""not loving her anymore"" and soon starts laughing cruelly at him when he sense something wrong, her fellow brides attack Jason from behind. Jason breaks free, only to run into Count Yorga, who chases Jason down a hall and strangles him. Bruddah tosses Jason's body into the throne/coffin room for the brides, including Ellen and newly vampiric Mitzi, to feed upon."
"That evening, Reverend Thomas (Tom Toner) phones Jennifer, but it is revealed she lies dead on her bed with a large knife sticking out of her chest. From her window, Tommy can be seen walking away from the house. After Thomas learns (off camera) of Jennifer's death, David is sure he is correct about the Count's true nature and manages to convince Reverend Thomas and investigating police detectives Lt. Madden (Rudy De Luca) and Sgt. O'Connor (Craig T. Nelson) to join him in a rescue-mission at Yorga's mansion. Reverend Thomas is sent to distract Yorga while Baldwin, Madden and O'Connor sneak in to search the manor, armed with sticks they can cross and hold up to ward off the vampires. Meanwhile, the pastor falls for Yorga's charms and reveals the others' suspicions that he is a vampire, alerting Yorga of danger. Thomas is tricked into walking into the quicksand pit and promptly sinks to his death. Yorga returns to the manor, awakens his brides and unleashes them through the household as he psychically calls Cynthia to him."
"Baldwin splits from the detectives to expand the room-by-room search, and upon opening one door discovers Jason's corpse, covered in bloody bite marks with an IV draining remaining blood from his neck into a glass-bottle on the floor beneath him. Later, Baldwin finally finds the half-mind-controlled Cynthia and attempts to escape; however, he is nearly beaten by Brudda. Falling into a suit of armor, Baldwin grabs a metal mace and knocks Brudda out with a violent blow to the face."
"Meanwhile, Madden and O'Connor come across Yorga's vampire brides. When the women don't respond to their question and continue tho silently advance on them. the detectives attempt to shoot them point blank, but their bullets prove ineffective as the undead women continue to give chase. In the midst of their escape, they encounter Brudda and managed to shoot him to death. Eventually O'Connor is separated in the brides' throne/coffin room by a shutter and immediately attacked from behind and bitten by the witch (also a vampire) as Madden helplessly listens to O'Connor's death-screams. Madden tries to find a way to him, but lured in by a voice from the shadows (thinking it is Baldwin) and killed by Tommy who stabs him in the same way he murdered Jennifer."
"Baldwin and Cynthia are the only ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin throughout the estate. Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. He is about to take her when he hears Baldwin scream his name who seemingly have escaped the brides. Yorga takes Cynthia and flees to upper balcony of the estate as Baldwin (who grabs an iron battle-axe from a wall) chases the two. Yorga and Baldwin fight with Baldwin surprisingly seeming stronger than before, however Yorga gains the advantage. Just as he is about to kill Baldwin via choking, Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces, causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, and he lies motionless on the pavement below, dead."
"Cynthia hugs Baldwin, believing the ordeal over. However, she notices something wrong and pulls away. To her horror, she sees that Baldwin skin has turned pale and bite marks on his face revealing he was has transformed into a vampire) having apparently not escaped from the brides unscathed). Cynthia tries to run from him, but Baldwin pulls her back and promptly bites her."
"The last shot of the movie is Tommy playing with his ball in front of the orphanage accompanied by a haunting rendition of the song the children sang at the beginning of the film. Though Yorga is dead, his evil lives on as those who know of him are either dead or turned into vampires and will carry out his curse. The film ends with the ominous implication that Cynthia has joined them, Baldwin now their new leader and the surviving vampires are resting within the manor, where they will proceed to spread the vampirisim to the unwitting orphanage and soon to the rest of the town."
"In one scene, Yorga is seen watching a Spanish-language version of ""The Vampire Lovers"" on his television."
After World War I it became part of the British mandate territory of Tanganyika. The British administration continued to reserve and exploit forests.
"Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates (about 4% compared to the Tanzanian national average of 2.1%), a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania. Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuel wood."
"70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost. Its ecosystems were significantly disrupted by foreign-controlled logging companies which carried out large-scale deforestation from the 1950s onwards. A sawmill at Tanga processed East Usambara timber, and its output was increased in the 1970s with Finnish development funding. Major land and forest degradation remains a pressing issue."
"There are still many places that attract visitors looking for experiences beyond developed tourist resorts. These include the trade town of Lushoto (German colonial era Wilhelmsthal), the once popular German resort Amani Nature Reserve and farm, and the Mazumbai University Forest, which is considered the last example of a pristine tropical forest in the East Usambaras."
= = = New York Peace Society = = =
"The New York Peace Society was the first peace society to be established in the United States. It has had several different incarnations, as it has merged into other organizations or dissolved and then been re-created."
"David Low Dodge founded the society in 1815, soon after the end of the War of 1812. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as Gibraltar and Malta, describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on Christian grounds."
"In 1828, the society merged with others in New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts to form the American Peace Society."
"The society was re-formed as an independent organization in 1837. Until 1844, it sought to prevent war against Mexico by advocating negotiation. It then dissolved. An attempt was made to re-create it, but this was short-lived."
"The society was founded anew for the final time in 1906, in the context of the Philippine–American War, the rapid expansion of American influence and military usage abroad and the rise of the Anti-Imperialist League. It was organized by Oscar Straus and Charles Levermore with the support of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie."
"The society was involved in a ""National Arbitration and Peace Conference"" in 1907. During the First World War, the society helped to organize the League to Enforce Peace in opposition to American involvement."
"In 1940, the society merged into the Quaker World Alliance for International Friendship through Religion."
= = = National Awami Party (Wali) = = =
The Wali Khan faction of the National Awami Party was formed after the 1967 split in the original NAP between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan. The Wali Khan faction was later named National Awami Party (NAP) after the separation of East Pakistan.
"The NAP was banned twice during its eight-year-long existence, the first time under Yahya Khans government in 1971 and the second time in 1975 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government. It was then resurrected under the name National Democratic Party, from which in turn was formed the Awami National Party."
"The Party represented left wing views in Pakistan and its core politics was based on the disbanding of the One Unit, restoration of adult franchise (1967–1970), land reforms, protection of tenants' rights, redistribution of wealth through nationalisation, Pakistan becoming a confederacy as well as the holding of fair elections, protection of an independent judiciary and freedom of the press. It contested the 1970 election, winning the second largest number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the largest in Baluchistan, and a handful of seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly. It failed to win any seats in Punjab and Sindh."
"After the division of Pakistan in 1971, NAP formed coalition governments in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on the basis of winning majority of seats in the two provinces. Arbab Sikandar Khan was appointed Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo Governor of Balochistan. Sardar Akhtar Mengal was elected the first Chief Minister of Balochistan and the NAP supported Mufti Mahmud of the JUI as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The party was disbanded in 1975 amidst a government crackdown. It was resurrected in 1976 under the National Democratic Party under Sherbaz Mazari but split in 1979 following disagreements amongst the left wing of the party against the leadership."
"A brief attempt was made to resurrect the Party by Ajmal Khattak under the name National Awami Party of Pakistan in 2000, however the party was routed in the 2002 election and much of its leadership merged back with the ANP."
"On 30 November 1967 the NAP split between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan, ostensibly because Bhashani sided with China while Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, along with Khan Abdul Wali Khan, sided with the USSR in the Sino-Soviet split."
"Following the split, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. Soon after, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by Afzal Bangash, then decided to leave the NAP and establish the Mazdoor Kisan Party."
"The NAP party leadership struggling with a rivalry between Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Mahmudul Haq Usmani for the Presidency. Ultimately the leadership backed Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate. The National Council of the Party met on 30 June and 1 July 1968 at Royal Hotel, Peshawar, with Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President of East Pakistan NAP chairing the first session. Abdul Wali Khan was unanimously elected as President of the party."
Office Bearers
"The National Awami Party was a socialist political party that advocated greater provincial autonomy and the Theory of Four Nationalities. The theory advocated by senior NAP leader Bizenjo stated Pakistan was composed of four distinct ""nations"", the Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Western Punjabi."
"The party contested the 1970 elections from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh and East Pakistan. It did not field any candidates in the Punjab, Nationally it fielded 16 candidates from K-P, three of whom got elected, securing 18.4% of the vote, in Balochistan three out of four candidates were elected but it failed to win any seats from Sindh."
"In 1971, in an attempt to avert a possible showdown between the Military and the people of East Pakistan, on March 23, 1971, Khan, along with other Pakistani politicians, jointly met Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They offered support to Mujeeb in the formation of a government, but it was already too late to break the impasse as Yahya Khan had already decided on a full scale military crackdown. Pakistan's increasing vulnerability and widespread international outrage against the military crackdown eventually created a situation that led to war between Pakistan and India. This war proved disastrous and culminated in Pakistan's armed forces being defeated in East Pakistan and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Shocked by the defeat, Yahya Khan resigned from office and the military. Under General Gul Hassan Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was brought back from America and appointed President."
"During the martial law crackdown against East Pakistan, the National Awami Party under Wali Khan was one of a handful of parties that protested the military operation. In one case, Khan helped a senior East Pakistani diplomat's son escape to Afghanistan from possible internment in West Pakistan. The military government, in retaliation against the protests, banned the party and launched mass arrests of party activists."
"In 1972, as the opposition leader, Wali Khan was contacted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who wanted to lift martial law and set up a new constitution. Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the NAP signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the Tripartite Agreement. The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This led to the formation of National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto."
"In 1972, Wali Khan was elected as Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the NAP made several initiatives to broaden its support across the country. It dropped its demand to rename the then North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunistan, declared Urdu as the provincial language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and espoused federalism with greater autonomy for the provinces. Senior party leader Ghaus Bux Bizenjo advocated that Pakistan consisted of four nationalities and their empowerment equally would prevent the breakup of Pakistan."
"Water ingress and damaged roof timbers required roof repairs to be started in 2015, however this has stalled due to lack of funds."
"Reconstruction of the tulku and lama quarters is planned to enable enthronement of the current tulku, who is studying in India. Funding limitations have delayed this work and the frescoes continue to be affected by rain water."
Shrine imagery was removed whilst the roof was replaced. A number of items remain with individual villagers until the work is completed.

= = = Taxonomic contributions of Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton = = =
This is a list of the taxonomic contributions of Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton.
"The natural history specimens and cultural objects collected by Major Powell-Cotton (1866–1940) on his expeditions to Africa and Asia are finely preserved in the Powell-Cotton Museum. According to the Mammal Catalogue produced by the Powell-Cotton Museum, the species of over 6400 specimens (more than 230 species) preserved in the Museum belong to the following 42 families and 149 genera:"
"The majority of the specimens fall within the scope of the genera Alcelaphus, Anomalurus, Cephalophus, Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Colobus, Euoticus, Felis, Gazella, Gorilla, Kobus, Pan, Redunca, Sylvicapra, Syncerus and Tragelaphuse (number of the specimens exceeds 100). And, except the two presented specimens of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) collected in Swiss Alps in 1905, all the mammal specimens in the Powell-Cotton Museum were collected in Africa and Asia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, which came from the following countries or regions: Abyssinia, Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea, India, Kashmir, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Ogaden, Pakistan, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Tibet, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
"The large mammal specimen collection was built up on the basis of Powell-Cotton's forty years’ exploration in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, which is helpful in conducting taxonomic, zoological, ethnobiological/ethnomedical and ethnographic studies. The mammal type specimens identified from the total specimens are listed as follows:"
"The mammal species named after Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton can be distinguished by the subspecies name “cottoni” or “powelli”. The specimens collected by Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton play an important role in scientific studies because the existence of some of the cottoni species are in danger now, for example, the B/W Colobus (Colobus angolensis cottoni) was rated “Least Concern” in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species published in 2008. The accounts of Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton's specimen collection activities can be found in his books and articles. And, there is no difference between some of his writings and adventure stories. For example, in Black rhinoceros hunting which is included in Big Game Shooting in Africa, he vividly recorded the hunting of a black Rhino:"
"Aside from the two books titled “A Sporting Trip through Abyssinia” (1902) and “In Unknown Africa” (1904) and the book chapter titled “Black rhinoceros hunting”, his writings were published in journals and magazines, including The Antiquaries Journal (e.g. vol. 4, no. 3, 1924), The Geographical Journal (vol. 30, 1907), Journal of the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire (e.g. Jan. 1937), Journal of the Royal African Society (e.g. vol. 7, 1907), The Wide World Magazine (e.g. Feb. 1904) and Man (e.g. vol. 29, 1929). The content of these writings includes the records of mammal hunting, accounts of the biological characteristics of mammals and descriptions of local (primarily African) culture and nature."
"The mammal specimens (skulls, skeletons, skin, horns, etc.) in the Powell-Cotton Museum are exhibits as well as objects of study. Some academics from universities and research institutes such as University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Sheffield, University of Kent, University of Exeter, The University of Bradford, University of the Witwatersrand, University of California, Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III, University of Melbourne, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Canterbury Christchurch University, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna used to visit this museum in order to obtain skeletal data, collect samples for DNA or dietary analysis and so on. One of the famous academic visitors is Professor Colin Groves of the Australian National University, whose research interests include but are not limited to mammalian taxonomy (especially primate taxonomy), human evolution and taxonomic history of mammals. In addition to the specimens preserved in the museums such as Natural History Museum (London), Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris), Museum voor Middenafrika (Tervuren), Naturalis (Leiden), Musée Royale d’Histoire Naturelle (Brussels), Kenya National Museums (Nairobi), Zoologisches Museum A. Humboldt (Berlin) and Museum A. Koenig (Bonn), he also utilized the mammal specimens provided by the Powell-Cotton Museum and hence conducted many comparative studies, for example, he used to measure the skulls of Northern White Rhinoceros, and examine the colobus material and the specimens of musk-deer at the Museum. Some of these studies can be found in his noted book “Primate Taxonomy” which is considered to relabel museum cabinets. And, he thought highly of the Powell-Cotton Museum."
"Under the joint effort of Bernard Wood, University Professor of Human Origins at The George Washington University, Adam D. Gordon, an anthropologist and assistant professor at the University at Albany, State University of New York and Malcolm Harman, curator of the Powell-Cotton Museum, the “Human Origin Database” project, which is funded by The G. Harold & Leila Y. Mathers Foundation and aims to provide information about fossil hominin specimens and extant hominoid specimens, has been developed. In addition to the measurements and skeletal element information in Professor Wood's 1991 book Koobi Fora Research Project.

"Other steam systems were opened in Devonport, Wellington and Christchurch."
"The first electric tram ran to Maori Hill, Dunedin in 1900, and the tram systems in the main centres were all electrified in the 1900s."
Dunedin also had several Cable Car lines to various suburbs and Wellington still has the Wellington Cable Car (actually a funicular) to Kelburn.
"Most twentieth-century systems were electric with overhead wires, apart from the Takapuna (Auckland) steam tramway (1910–1927) and Gisborne, which had two battery-electric trams (1913–1929). The only system to be closed during this period was Napier, in 1931 after the Napier earthquake. Several long suburban lines were replaced by buses, e.g. Christchurch City to Richmond, Burwood and North Beach in 1934, and to Linwood in 1936."
"During the 1950s and early 1960s all the tramway systems were replaced by buses or trolleybuses: Wanganui (1950), Invercargill (1952), Christchurch and New Plymouth (1954), Auckland and Dunedin (1956) and Wellington (1964). This followed a general international trend, especially in North American and British cities. The traditional tram systems of the period were perceived as a slow and outdated means of transport, characterised by inflexible routes and expensive infrastructure maintenance. In Wellington there was significant opposition to the closure of the last tramway system in New Zealand, and the final decision to disestablish the remaining lines followed on a public referendum in 1959."
"All trolleybus systems in New Zealand have now been closed: Christchurch (1956), New Plymouth (1967), Auckland (1980), Dunedin (1982) and Wellington (2017)."
"Auckland City had a private company operating horse-drawn trams from 1884. The Auckland Electric Tram Company's system was officially opened on 17 November 1902, but public service was delayed because three of the motormen, from Sydney, Australia, had been drowned in the SS Elingamite shipwreck near Three Kings Islands on 9 November 1902. Public service commenced on 23 November 1902 and continued to 29 December 1956."
"With services running from downtown at the Waitematā Harbour, across to Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour, Auckland had the world's only 'coast to coast' tramway system. The Electric Tram Company started as a private company before being acquired by Auckland City Council. The resulting council owned entity was required to run services outside the borders of Auckland City."
"In 1938, a circular trolleybus route opened, operating from Queen Street - Wyndham Street - Hobson Street - Victoria Street and servicing the Farmers department store in Hobson Street. Trolleybuses may have been chosen for this service because the corner of Queen Street and Wyndham Street was too sharp and steep for trams. Electric trams operated a similar Farmers department store connection from a terminus stop in Beresford Street off Pitt Street along Hobson Street to a terminus stop in Wyndham Street."
"From 1949 a modernisation programme saw the electric tram routes being replaced by trolleybuses, commencing with the Herne Bay route and with trolleybuses eventually replicating the entire network by December 1956 when the last electric tram ran."
"While the introduction of two light rail lines became a government commitment in 2018, as of there are only two tram services in Auckland, the Western Springs Tramway and the Wynyard loop tram. Both are heritage systems. The Western Springs Tramway runs between two MOTAT museum sites. The tracks run parallel to part of the original Point Chevalier tram route on Great North Road, but they were not part of the original system."
"Also known as the Wynyard Quarter tram and Dockline Tram. Operates on a circuit close to downtown Auckland. The route consists of the loop Halsey Street, Gaunt Street, Daldy Street and Jellicoe Street. There have been proposals to extend this in the future. The service was promoted and funded by the former Auckland Regional Council and now by Panuku Development Auckland. The tramway is operated by Auckland Tramways, administered by Panuku Development Auckland. Trams commenced testing and crew training on Friday 29 July 2011. The system was opened on 6 August 2011, prior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup."
"Three former Melbourne trams have been used. X1 class 466, (was for a time 2011-2017 renumbered ATL 257), is being leased from the Newstead Trams based at Bendigo Tramways and arrived at the Ports of Auckland by ship 8 June 2011 and was delivered to the new tram shed 15 June 2011. From 2011 until 2015, Melbourne W2 class 421, then numbered ATL 258 was leased from Bendigo. In July 2015, SW6 model trams 852 and 881 arrived from Melbourne after becoming surplus to requirements. In September 2011, MOTAT's Western Springs Tramway loaned restored 1906 Auckland tram No.44 for the Auckland Heritage Festival and through the summer 2011/12. No.44 was loaned again in September and early October 2012."
"The Dockline Tramway has closed a number of times for the gentrification of streets around Wynyard Quarter which have involved relevelling the roads. For instance in until October 2014, and again from mid 2015 until late 2016 while Gaunt Street and the southern end of Daldy Street were gentrified. In April 2017, trams ran on a short section of the line while roadworks and gentrification took place in Halsey Street and Daldy Street, including watergardens and realignment of the tramway along the reinstated Daldy Street. The Tramway was suspended indefinitely on 5 August 2018 due to Panuku selling an area that included part of its tracks to a developer, but was given a reprieve on 22 November 2018 with Auckland Councillors voting to reinstate the full original loop and have the tram running for Americas Cup 2021, then review its future."
Devonport on Auckland's North Shore had a horse tramway from September 1886 to 1888 running to Cheltenham Beach. The tramway utilised wooden rails and failed financially after two years.
"A steam tramway operated between Bayswater and Milford on Auckland's North Shore. It travelled along Lake Road, through Takapuna and circled Lake Pupuke between 22 December 1910 and 26 April 1927. The steam tram trailers had been built so that they could be converted to electric operation, to a similar design to Auckland M & L type trams. The carriages were hauled by 13"" steam motors, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia. The tramway struggled financially, and closed after 16 years. The carriages were sold to Wanganui and Dunedin and converted to electric trams and the steam tram boilers sold for other uses. A single trailer, which became a Dunedin electric tram ""Takapuna"" No.66, is the sole survivor, at the Otago Early Settlers Museum."
"Christchurch had steam and horse trams from 1880, then electric trams from 6 June 1905 to 11 September 1954. They were replaced by trolleybuses and motor buses. A Christchurch heritage tram line was established in the city centre on a loop track in 1995, and reopened on a limited circuit in November 2013 after being temporarily non-operational following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011, which interrupted tramway services while the CBD was cordoned off. The Tramway reopened November 27, 2013 on a combination of the original route and an extension that was in progress at the time of the earthquakes. There are plans to extend the route in 2014 to include the full pre-earthquake circuit and the extension through the Re:Start Mall and High Street which was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck."
"In Dunedin electric trams operated on several routes from 23 October 1900 (Maori Hill) and 24 December 1903 (municipal service, to Normanby & Gardens) to 29 March 1956, and were replaced by trolleybuses and buses."
"Gisborne had Edison-Beach battery-electric trams from 13 April 1913 to 8 July 1929. There were two trams from the Federal Storage Battery Car Co, New Jersey and two from Boon & Co, Christchurch. AR Harris of Christchurch was the New Zealand agent for Edison Batteries. The trams were slow; their maximum speed was 32 km/hour, and initially they were restricted by the Public Works Department to 16 km/hour. There were two inland routes: Ormond Rd, and Gladstone Rd to Te Hapara (Lytton Rd). They were replaced by buses, following a close referendum in 1928."
Auckland Weekly News had photos of the interior and exterior of trams at the 1913 opening.
"Invercargill had the southernmost tram system in the world, horse trams 1881–1908, electric trams from 26 March 1912 to 10 September 1952. They were replaced by buses."
"Construction began in January 1911 and lines to Waikiwi and Georgetown opened on 26 March 1912. Later that year two more lines opened, to North Invercargill and South Invercargill; the latter was the southernmost electrified street tram line in the world and ran to Tramway Road. The network operated as two routes: Route A between Georgetown and Waikiwi and Route B between North and South Invercargill. The Waikiwi line closed in 1947, though a section remained in operation until 1951. The Georgetown route closed on 2 July 1951, but the section to Rugby Park Stadium remained open until August 1951. The South Invercargill line closed on 31 May 1952. The last route, to North Invercargill, closed on 10 September 1952."
"Napier had electric trams to Port Ahuriri, from 8 September 1913 to 3 February 1931. The system was damaged by the Napier earthquake on 3 February 1931, and was never restored, being replaced by buses."
"New Plymouth had an electric tram service from 10 March 1916 to 23 July 1954, operated by the New Plymouth Corporation Tramways and reputedly the smallest municipality in the world to operate trams on the overhead electricity system. There were two main routes, through the town centre from the Port to Fitzroy, and from the town centre to David Street, Westown. In 1924 a short line was built to Pukekura Park (this closed in 1937) and proposals were also made for lines to Vogletown and Frankleigh Park."
"In 1950 the Westown route was replaced with a fleet of 4 Crossley trolleybuses in 1950, in turn being replaced with diesel buses in October 1967. The Port-Fitzroy route was replaced directly by diesel buses in 1954."
"There were 10 trams, 4 single-truck Boon cars (No.s 1–4), 3 Double-truck Boon cars (Nos 5–6 and 10) and 3 Birney Safety Cars introduced in 1921 (Nos. 7–9). These all lasted until closure of the system, at which time the bodies were auctioned off and sold. Only one tram body survives (Birney No 8) and is currently in Wanganui."
"Whanganui, then known as Wanganui had electric trams from 11 December 1908 to 24 September 1950. The service went two ways from the city centre, inland to Aramoho and out to Castlecliff and the Port. The Castlecliff route competed with the Castlecliff railway and the success of the trams at winning patronage led to the cancellation of passenger trains in April 1932. The trams were replaced by buses."
"Wanganui tram No.12 was restored in West Auckland by Dave Harre and his team and gifted to the people of Whanganui The Tramways Whanganui Trust has united the body onto a former Brussels Brill 21e type four-wheel truck, and plans to renovate Wanganui tram No.8 and New Plymouth Birney No.8. 120m of tramline has been laid alongside the Whanganui river between the new tram shed towards the berth of the PS Waimarie and due to be opened for demonstrations and rides once the appropriate Rail Operator Licences have been granted. Further extensions are planned."
"Wellington had steam then horse trams from 1878, then electric trams from 30 June 1904 to 2 May 1964. They were replaced by trolleybuses and buses. Wellington now has the only funicular cable car line operating in New Zealand."
"The Wellington Tramway Museum preserves and operates a collection of Wellington trams at The Kapiti Coast Electric Tramway, Queen Elizabeth Park, MacKays Crossing near Paekakariki on the Kapiti Coast. Planning for a light rail system is underway."
"Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864. The main towns, Greymouth, Westport, Hokitika and Ross, and smaller settlements like Brighton, Charleston, Kamiere and Kumara had wooden tramways. Publican John Behan of Charleston, now a ghost town, petitioned the Canterbury Provincial Council in 1870 for compensation after the rerouting of a wooden tramway along a branch road removed most of his stalwart drinkers. The 'bush tram' from Greymouth to Kumara took three hours, and during the trip passengers had to cross the Taramakau River in a cage or 'flying fox' suspended from a cable see photo c1880. These tramways were for freight and passengers. There were few roads on the Coast, and tramway owners were entitled to charge a toll to pedestrians walking along the tracks. The gauges varied from to , with wooden rails (see Stewart and May). Some of these were ""bush tramways"", similar to other systems used to carry timber out of the bush."
"The American firms of J G Brill, Philadelphia and John Stephenson Co, New Jersey supplied many trams, as well as other firms; English, Australian and local. Birney Safety cars were supplied by J.G. Brill Co. to Invercargill (6) and New Plymouth (3) in 1921, though they were too wide for Napier. Gordon Coates, then Minister of Transport was in New Plymouth for a test run on the new trams. When the driver showed how the 'dead man's control' worked by lifting his hand off the controller, the Minister and all were thrown to the floor when it nose dived on its front wheels then slumped back on the track with a shudder."
"Highwire artist Nik Wallenda had been planning to walk across the canyon since 2008, but put the plan on hold first due to logistical difficulties and then to highwire walk over Niagara Falls in 2012. After his success at Niagara, he accelerated plans to cross the canyon. In March 2013, Wallenda and Discovery came to terms on television rights for the walk."
"To prepare, Wallenda practiced in his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, including during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person to tightrope walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected."
"""Skywire Live"" aired live in over 200 countries worldwide. It was a ratings success in the United States, generating Discovery's highest-ever rating for a live broadcast. The show also generated a lot of interest of social media, with Wallenda's public display of his Christian faith being a focal point."
"Nik Wallenda is American highwire artist and member of the famed Flying Wallendas circus family. He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records. In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope. In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls. The feat aired live on ABC who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event."
"The Grand Canyon area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats. In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a Lincoln Stanard biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just from the Canyon's edge. The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby. In 1980, stuntman Dar Robinson drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell. He did the stunt in Hualapai Indian Reservation after being denied a permit by the National Park. In 1999, daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped a narrow portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a motorcycle, breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process. The event aired live on Fox News. In 2006, Bob Burnquist skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute. In 2011, Yves ""Jetman"" Rossy used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes. He covered a distance of before parachuting into the canyon."
"Nik Wallenda originally secured permits to walk across ""the Grand Canyon"" in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. His agent, Winston Simone, commented ""There's no electricity [at the planned location], there's no hotels, and for the last half-hour there are no paved roads."" Additionally, at a then-estimated distance of , the feat would be the longest walk of Wallenda's career by a significant margin. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing ""within a year"". In August 2012, he said that he was ""98 percent"" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and announced he would get ""something in writing"" that no safety harness would be required for the walk."
"On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery. Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device. After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the Navajo. According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly. The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies."
"According to Wallenda, ""There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]"". The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed , with the steel cable hitting . To prepare, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to . During Tropical Storm Andrea he practiced among wind gusts and heavy rain. Wallenda said it was ""hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control."" His highwire shoes, which are custom made by his mother, had elk-skin bottoms to counteract the heat."
"On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of ""MythBusters"" titled ""Duct Tape Canyon"" to coincide with Wallenda's walk. On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only duct tape."
"On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park. The location was outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat ""Nik Wallenda ... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon"". Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply ""the Grand Canyon"", while the Associated Press described it as a ""gorge near the Grand Canyon."" Commentary by ""Forbes"" writer Andrew Bender said there was ""one problem"" with the walk – ""It [wasn't] at the Grand Canyon"". He did, however, say the risks were as real and the visuals as spectacular at the location. ""National Geographic"" described the location as ""the Grand Canyon"" but noted that, like previous ""Grand Canyon"" stunts, it was taking place outside the park's borders."
"According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. A Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson said the walk ""would not have been approved"" to take place in the Park due to regulations that ""events must not unreasonably impair the park’s atmosphere of peace and tranquility or have an unacceptable impact on the experience of park visitors."""
"The event, entitled ""Skywire Live"", aired live on the Discovery Channel in 219 countries with a 10-second delay. Coverage began with an hour-and-ten-minute preshow, followed by an hour-and-ten-minute main event. It was produced by Peacock Productions and hosted by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist. During the event, viewers were able to select from five different camera angles online at SkywireLive.com, including one attached to his chest that faced straight down. Another camera attached to Wallenda faced straight ahead, and a film crew filmed from the bottom of the Canyon."
"Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with evangelist and family friend Joel Osteen. He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey. To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public. Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for post-traumatic stress disorder in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals."
"As the walk began at 7:38pm MDT, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying ""Help me to relax, Lord"", ""God, you’re so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord"", and ""Thank you, Jesus."" Midway through he said ""Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God"". Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge."
"At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent resonance effects. Terry and Mike Troffer were his safety coordinator and chief engineer, respectively, for the event."
"Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, ""We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country,"" and said he expected the event to boost tourism. Tribal president Ben Shelly said he was grateful for the publicity. ""It’s exposing what a beautiful land we have"", he said. ""Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation."" However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism. The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators."
"After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that ""it took every bit of me to stay focused"". He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful. Additionally, he said an ""optical illusion"" made it hard to concentrate. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity ""was a dream come true."""
"""Skywire Live With Nik Wallenda"" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. It beat out NBC's ""Crossing Lines"" (4.4 million viewers) and CBS's ""60 Minutes"" (8.2 million) among other offerings. Viewership increased steadily throughout the program, with a spike as the walk itself began."
"During the walk, 13 million people were tuned in. Those numbers made ""Skywire Live"" the highest rated live program in Discovery's history, easily beating the 4.21 million people who watched Felix Baumgartner's skydive in October 2012, and third-highest overall. The 4.77 share during the actual walk was also the highest in company history. Pre-coverage of the walk also pulled in high numbers, attracting 6.25 million viewers. ""Naked and Afraid"" which debuted after ""Skywire"" attracted 4.16 million viewers. Overall, Discovery had its fourth highest-ranked night ever."
"Online coverage attracted 2.1 million viewers, and tweets hit 40,000 per minute. During the peak hour, the program had 648,000 mentions on Twitter. Additionally, Shark Week and #SnuffyTheSeal trended nationally after a commercial for Shark Week featuring a fictional seal named Snuffy aired during ""SkyWire"". Overall, the show won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day."
"To capitalize on the program's success, Discovery aired a follow-up interview, ""Skywire: Nik Talks the Walk"", on June 30. In the special, Wallenda provided commentary on his walk as the entire 23 minute feat was replayed."
"Commentary by Sally Jenkins published by the ""Washington Post"" called Wallenda ""The ultimate athlete, free of all law except gravity ... Beyond criticism. Committing a pointless act — yet praying."" Jenkins remarked ""We thought daredevils were gone — too much science had reduced them to the predictable ... But along has come this new breed."" Comparing Wallenda and Baumgartner's record skydive that also aired on Discovery, she speculated that the emergence of online media combined with ""stale, stupid predictability"" of television shows has led the re-emergence of interest in daredevil activity. She concluded ""Wallenda’s meaningless act restored the meaning of real."" ""The Telegraph""'s Ben Fogle declared ""I have never felt such fear for another person ... I have a new superhero: not a superman with a cape, but a slightly tubby dad in jeans and a T-shirt."""
"On social media, Wallenda's prominent display of his faith was the most popular topic. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch tweeted ""Evangelism via entertainment on a tightrope and a major cable network. Brilliant."" In contrast comedian and noted atheist Ricky Gervais poked fun saying ""Well done Jesus for getting that bloke across the Grand Canyon safely. I bet he feels silly for wasting so much time practicing now."" Actor Dean Norris remarked ""Regardless of religious belief or not,feel little happier bout life then had #wallenda kept saying thank you nihilists, life is meaningless."" Interviewing Joel Osteen after Wallenda's walk, Piers Morgan called the event ""an advertisement for the power of prayer and Christianity in America""."
"Blue jeans manufacture Buffalo David Bitton was surprised that Wallenda wore a pair of their jeans for the walk. To celebrate, they erected a billboard showing a picture of the walk and reading ""Dear Nik, Thanks for taking us to new heights. Buffalo David Bitton."" The company also offered Wallenda and his immediate family free jeans for the rest of their lives."

= = = Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery = = =
"Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery was a place of burial. It is located in the town of Orpington in South East London, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo-Saxon period, it was part of the much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Fordcroft was a mixed inhumation and cremation ceremony."
"Archaeologists affiliated with the local Orpington Museum began excavating in 1965, expecting to find evidence of Romano-British occupation, but after discovering the cemetery decided to focus on it. Excavation continued for four seasons, ending in 1968."
"The site was located in Orpington, close to the border with St. Mary Cray. It sits between Bellefield Road and Poverest Road, near to the junction with the A224 road. The source of the River Cray lies half a mile south of the cemetery, while the river itself passes by 200 metres away from the site. The plot of land on which it was discovered was 1/8 of an acre in size. The soil is largely brick-earth, resting on the Flood Plain gravel which covers the valley floor."
"The nearest settlement that is known to be long-established is the farmstead of Poverest, the name of which can be traced to the early-14th century."
"The area remained agricultural land lying between the two villages until the mid-19th century, when increasing development led to the area becoming suburban. Several Victorian cottages had been built atop the cemetery, but were demolished during the following century, when the site became ""overgrown with weeds and littered with rubbish"" prior to excavation."
"With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the ""civitas"" of ""Cantiaci"", a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture."
"The Old English term ""Kent"" first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name ""Cantii"". Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of the sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Polhill cemetery was in use."
"Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith ""dominated"" archaeological research in Kent."
"The Fordcroft cemetery contained a mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators to believe that they were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists have discovered a total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a place of burial between ""circa"" 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley."
"There is evidence of nearby Romano-British occupation, which numismatic evidence shows extended to at least ""c"". 370. and Tester suggested that the Anglo-Saxons might have intentionally adopted Fordcroft as a cemetery site because of this. Equally, he thought it possible that the reuse of the site was simply fortuitous."
"Many of the skeletons were heavily decayed, although in many cases the teeth and long bones were sufficiently preserved for osteoarchaeologists to determine the age and sex of the individual."
"Most of the inhumation graves had the head facing westward, though in some cases they instead faced south. Most of the grave cuts were roughly rectangular with rounded corners, but some were less regular in form."
"Due to 19th century construction on the site, it was impossible for the archaeologists to accurately determine where the Anglo-Saxon ground level had been, and therefore how deep the graves had been cut."
"In the 1940s, a service trench had been excavated in the adjacent Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the ""Archaeologia Cantiana"" journal, suggesting that there might have been a building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored."
"The first archaeological discoveries at the site were Romano-British in origin, although no evidence of buildings from this period were discovered. Soon, an Anglo-Saxon cremation urn was found, followed by several inhumations, revealing that this had been the site of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. Thenceforth, the excavation of the cemetery became the primary objective of the archaeologists. In the first two-seasons' work, 16 cremations and 29 inhumations were discovered. At the time of its discovery, it was recognised as the first ""well-authenticated"" archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement along the River Cray. Elderly members of the community who had formerly lived in the cottages on the site visited the excavation, providing ""likely and amusing comments"" following the revelation that they had dwelt above a cemetery."
"A test pit was opened in the garage of No. 17 Poverest Road, uncovering another grave, and it is believed that further burials might be located under the house. The team excavated all available areas, although were unable to dig under either of the roads enclosing the site, or under the houses to the east and west."
= = = Battle of Apros = = =
"The Battle of Apros occurred between the forces of the Byzantine Empire, under co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos, and the forces of the Catalan Company, at Apros on July 1305."
"The Catalan Company had been hired by the Byzantines as mercenaries against the Turks, but despite the Catalans' successes against the Turks, the two allies distrusted each other, and their relationship was strained by the Catalans' financial demands. Eventually, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and his son and co-ruler Michael IX had the Catalan leader, Roger de Flor, assassinated with his entourage in April 1305."
"In July, the Byzantine army, comprising a large contingent of Alans as well as many Turcopoles, confronted the Catalans and their own Turkish allies near Apros in Thrace. Despite the Imperial Army's numerical superiority, the Alans withdrew after the first charge, whereupon the Turcopoles deserted ""en block"" to the Catalans. Prince Michael was injured and left the field and the Catalans won the day."

"Campbell claimed he had been unfairly beaten and took the matter of his eligibility to stand as a candidate to court. However his protest came to nothing, and Fitzgerald was declared the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province."
"Campbell's handling of land issues resulted in Governor of New Zealand George Grey receiving a large number of complaints about Campbell, as well as voluminous correspondence from him about colonists and run-holders. Campbell did not acknowledge James FitzGerald as superintendent and, despite repeated requests, refused to provide FitzGerald a return of revenue from land leases. Gerald Hensley points out that Campbell was """"maintaining with a splendid inconsistency that he had not received the Governor's dispatch instructing him to do so, even while quoting parts of it in his long and argumentative letters."""" During late 1853 there was a heated exchange of letters between the two men, into which Governor Grey was copied."
"On 5 October 1853 Alfred Domett, who was at that time Civil Secretary for central government, told Campbell that he was relieved of his commissionerships and that he was to hand over his records to William Guise Brittan, who had been appointed in his place (Brittan was already Commissioner within the Canterbury Block so this effectively amalgamated the two Canterbury Land Offices). Campbell was instead appointed as """"Registrar of Deeds for the Provence of Canterbury"""", replacing Brittan in this role."
"On 11 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council, apparently unaware that Campbell had already been removed from the land commissionerships (probably because Campbell took no action to relinquish office while he appealed to the Governor), adopted the following resolution agreeing to ask the Governor of New Zealand to remove Campbell from office:""""This Council, having taken into account the various papers upon their table in reference to the proceedings of the Commissioner of Crown Lands: resolve; That the Commissioner of Crown Lands, having as it appears to this Council, acted in disregard of the law, and having refused to afford this Council any information on the affairs of his office, and having otherwise shown himself wholly incompetent to the discharge of the duties thereof, an address be presented from this Council to His Excellency the Governor, praying His Excellency to be pleased to remove Colonel Campbell from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands."""""
"On 23 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council discussed Campbell's appointment as Registrar of Deeds. John Hall stated Campbell was """"even less qualified to be Registrar of Deeds, an office which particularly required to be filled by a person of business habits."""" The Council then adopted the following resolutions asking Governor Grey to remove Campbell as Registrar of Deeds and to combine registration of deeds with that of births, deaths and marriages in the same office under the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court:""""1. That this Council has learned with great surprise and regret that Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, after having been removed from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands, has been appointed as Registrar of Deeds for this Province. 2. That, considering how largely the interest of individuals may be affected by the Acts of the Registrar, and the extensive evil which may result from incompetence or mal-administration: this Council are of opinion that that office ought to be entrusted only to some person possessing the fullest confidence of the public. 3. The Council are of opinion that the office of Registrar of Deeds is one which ought, if possible, be filled by a person having a legal education, and that for the purposes of economy its duties might for the present be most conveniently performed by the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court.."""""
"Campbell refused to register any land deeds and, when the Provincial Council complained, Campbell """"denounced them as calumniators and prepared to sue the Superintendent and executive on an extraordinary variety of grounds ranging from usurpation to illegal absence from the province... [and] that the whole provincial establishment was illegal"""""
"In December 1854 (after George Grey had completed his first term as Governor of New Zealand) the central Government finally agreed to the removal of Campbell from office. The grounds for his removal were """"general unfitness for the duties of his office, willful and continued neglect of duty and a determined spirit of opposition and resistance to the Provincial Government, and disrespect towards its executive officers."""" Superintendent James FitzGerald appointed lawyer and court registrar Christopher Alderson Calvert as Registrar of Deeds in place of Campbell."
"Campbell went on to sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on the grounds that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office. Fitzgerald's letter to the Governor said """"I request the removal of an officer who has been condemned by the united voice of the public as wholly unfit to be entrusted with any public office whatever"""". Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had misstated the alleged libel."
"After removal as Land Commissioner Campbell is reported to have lived at Isabella (AKA Isabel) Lodge, an """"elegant and commodious house"""" located on Isabel Farm on Ferry Road, Christchurch, the property of Alexander 'Russian' Sherwood Jackson and his wife Isabella Mary Jackson."
"Campbell died in Christchurch aged 71, on 7 July 1858. The cause of death was stated as apoplexy He is buried with his wife at Barbadoes Street Cemetery Christchurch. Obituaries appeared in several papers."

= = = Katanpää-class mine countermeasure vessel = = =
"""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are a class of three multipurpose mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV) ordered by the Finnish Navy. The nearly 250 million euro contract was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.p.A. in 2006. Initially, all three vessels were scheduled to be delivered by 2014 and the class was expected to achieve operational readiness by 2015, but there have been various delays and the last vessel was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016."
"The ""Katanpää"" class is expected to remain in service until 2040–2042."
"In its safety and defence policy report of 2004 the Finnish Government announced that, in addition to training mobile coastal troops and protecting sea traffic, the Finnish Navy would start focusing on developing its mine countermeasure capabilities. As a result a decision was made to retire the aging ""Kuha""-class minesweepers and invest in a new mine countermeasure fleet, which would include minehunters and -sweepers, divers and a new mine warfare information system."
"A request for bids was published on 5 June 2004 and by 3 January 2005 the Finnish Navy had received offers from seven shipyards, both domestic and foreign. After an extensive evaluation it was decided to continue negotiations with Intermarine S.p.A of Italy. Kockums AB of Sweden and Navantia SA from Spain. Aker Finnyards Oy (Finland), Armaris SA (France), Lürssen Werft GmbH and Abeking & Rasmussen GmbH (both German) were left out. In November 2006 the contract for three mine countermeasure vessels was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.P.A. The total order worth was 244.8 million euros and it will include a spare parts package. About 50% of the total cost is contracted for Finnish companies and the shipbuilding contract includes a 100% offset agreement."
"The construction of the first vessel began in July 2007 with the ceremony of ""start of lamination"" which, for vessels built of composite materials, equals to the steel cutting ceremony. The construction of the second vessel was started in March 2008 and the third vessel in February 2009. The construction of the vessels was delayed by one year after the shipyard was devastated by a flood in early 2009. Two more floods occurred in late 2009, but the damage was not as extensive."
"The lead vessel of the class, ""Katanpää"", began its sea trials in March 2011, but due to additional delays it was not delivered until 4 May 2012. The vessel was shipped to Finland onboard BigLift heavy lift vessel ""Happy Dover"" which left Italy on 21 May. ""Katanpää"" was presented to the public in Helsinki on 9 July 2012, the 94th anniversary of the Finnish Navy. The second vessel, ""Purunpää"", was delivered to the Finnish Navy on 20 August 2013 and arrived in Turku onboard ""Happy Dynamic"" one month later. The third vessel, initially expected by 2015, was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016 and will arrive in Finland in December."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are expected to remain in service until 2040-2042."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels were initially referred to as the MCMV 2010 class after the mine countermeasure development project and ""MITO class"" after the Finnish word for mine countermeasures, ""miinantorjunta"". As naval vessel classes of the Finnish Navy are traditionally named after the lead ship of the class, the new class of mine countermeasure vessels received its final name when the first vessel was named ""Katanpää"" (pennant number 40) on 16 June 2009. The second vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class received its name, ""Purunpää"" (41), on 26 September 2010 and the third one was named ""Vahterpää"" (42) on 3 November 2011."
"The vessels have been named after historical locations, Katanpää being an old island fortress and naval port outside Kustavi in Western Finland, Purunpää an old harbor site in Dragsfjärd and Vahterpää an old naval base outside Loviisa in the Gulf of Finland. The same names were also carried by three of the four BYMS class minesweepers operated by the Finnish Navy in the 1950s. For the new class of vessels, the Finnish Navy has adopted a new prefix ""MHC"" which stands for ""Mine Hunter Coastal""."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are constructed of laminated composite materials. They are long and have a beam of and a draft of . The hull, decks and bulkheads are made of fiberglass, which in places are up to thick. The decks are additionally reinforced with balsa and carbon fiber. This improves shock resistance against underwater explosions and reduces the vessels' magnetic, noise and pressure signatures that could detonate the mines. The low-signature diesel-electric propulsion system consists of two MTU 8V-396-TE74 high-speed diesel engines, each producing , and two Voith Schneider propellers. The ""Katanpää""-class vessels are designed to operate in archipelagoes, coastal regions and open seas, and are capable of operating in ice. They will have a service speed of and a maximum range of ."
"The ""Katanpää""-class vessels will be equipped with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over . It is equipped with a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and SeaFox I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam echosounder and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment echosounder with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will be equipped with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions."
"Each vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class is equipped with a Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun for self-defence. The fire control is provided by Atlas Elektronik and the integrated system utilizes EOTS TV/IR multisensors. The system can be controlled from either one of five consoles in the combat information center or from the bridge, although only one console is equipped with the pedals required to control the gun. In addition the vessels are armed with depth charges."

"There are no EVEX-prefixed versions of the blend instructions from SSE4; instead, AVX-512 has a new set of blending instructions using mask registers as selectors. Together with the general compare into mask instructions below, these may be used to implement generic ternary operations or cmov, similar to XOP's VPCMOV."
"Since blending is an integral part of the EVEX encoding, these instruction may also be considered basic move instructions. Using the zeroing blend mode, they can also be used as masking instructions."
"AVX-512F has four new compare instructions. Like their XOP counterparts they use the immediate field to select between 8 different comparisons. Unlike their XOP inspiration, however, they save the result to a mask register and initially only support doubleword and quadword comparisons. The AVX-512BW extension provides the byte and word versions. Note that two mask registers may be specified for the instructions, one to write to and one to declare regular masking."
"The final way to set masks is using Logical Set Mask. These instructions perform either AND or NAND, and then set the destination opmask based on the result values being zero or non-zero. Note that like the comparison instructions, these take two opmask registers, one as destination and one a regular opmask."
"The compress and expand instructions match the APL operations of the same name. They use the opmask in a slightly different way from other AVX-512 instructions. Compress only saves the values marked in the mask, but saves them compacted by skipping and not reserving space for unmarked values. Expand operates in the opposite way, by loading as many values as indicated in the mask and then spreading them to the selected positions."
"A new set of permute instructions have been added for full two input permutations. They all take three arguments, two source registers and one index; the result is output by either overwriting the first source register or the index register. AVX-512BW extends the instructions to also include 16-bit (word) versions, and the AVX-512_VBMI extension defines the byte versions of the instructions."
"Two new instructions added can logically implement all possible bitwise operations between three inputs. They take three registers as input and an 8-bit immediate field. Each bit in the output is generated using a lookup of the three corresponding bits in the inputs to select one of the 8 positions in the 8-bit immediate. Since only 8 combinations are possible using three bits, this allow all possible 3 input bitwise operations to be performed."
"These are the only bitwise vector instructions in AVX-512F; EVEX versions of the two source SSE and AVX bitwise vector instructions AND, ANDN, OR and XOR were added in AVX-512DQ."
The difference in the doubleword and quadword versions is only the application of the opmask.
Truth table:
A number of conversion or move instructions were added; these complete the set of conversion instructions available from SSE2.
"Among the unique new features in AVX-512F are instructions to decompose floating-point values and handle special floating-point values. Since these methods are completely new, they also exist in scalar versions."
"This is the second set of new floating-point methods, which includes new scaling and approximate calculation of reciprocal, and reciprocal of square root. The approximate reciprocal instructions guarantee to have at most a relative error of 2."
The instructions in AVX-512 conflict detection (AVX-512CD) are designed to help efficiently calculate conflict-free subsets of elements in loops that normally could not be safely vectorized.
AVX-512 exponential and reciprocal instructions contain more accurate approximate reciprocal instructions than those in the AVX-512 foundation; relative error is at most 2. They also contain two new exponential functions that have a relative error of at most 2.
AVX-512 prefetch instructions contain new prefetch operations for the new scatter and gather functionality introduced in AVX2 and AVX-512. codice_1 prefetch means prefetching into level 1 cache and codice_2 means prefetching into level 2 cache.
"AVX-512DQ adds new doubleword and quadword instructions. AVX-512BW adds byte and words versions of the same instructions, and adds byte and word version of doubleword/quadword instructions in AVX-512F. A few instructions which get only word forms with AVX-512BW acquire byte forms with the AVX-512_VBMI extension (codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6)."
"Two new instructions were added to the mask instructions set: codice_7 and codice_8 (B and W forms with AVX-512DQ, D and Q with AVX-512BW). The rest of mask instructions, which had only word forms, got byte forms with AVX-512DQ and doubleword/quadword forms with AVX-512BW. codice_9 was extended to codice_10 and codice_11 by AVX-512BW."
"Among the instructions added by AVX-512DQ are several SSE, AVX instruction that didn't get AVX-512 versions with AVX-512F, among those are all the two input bitwise instructions and extract/insert integer instructions."
Instructions that are completely new are covered below.
Three new floating point operations are introduced. Since they are not only new to AVX-512 they have both packed/SIMD and scalar versions.
"The codice_12 instructions tests if the floating point value is one of eight special floating-point values, which of the eight values will trigger a bit in the output mask register is controlled by the immediate field. The codice_13 instructions perform minimum or maximum operations depending on the value of the immediate field, which can also control if the operation is done absolute or not and separately how the sign is handled. The codice_14 instructions operate on a single source, and subtract from that the integer part of the source value plus a number of bits specified in the immediate field of its fraction."
Extend VPCOMPRESS and VPEXPAND with byte and word variants. Shift instructions are new.
Vector Neural Network Instructions.
EVEX-encoded Galois field new instructions:
"VPCLMULQDQ with AVX-512F adds EVEX-encoded 512-bit version of PCLMULQDQ instruction. With AVX-512VL, it adds EVEX-encoded 256- and 128-bit versions. VPCLMULQDQ alone (that is, on non-AVX512 CPUs) adds only VEX-encoded 256-bit version. (Availability of the VEX-encoded 128-bit version is indicated by different CPUID bits: PCLMULQDQ and AVX.) The wider than 128-bit variations of the instruction perform the same operation on each 128-bit portion of input registers, but they do not extend it to select quadwords from different 128-bit fields (the meaning of imm8 operand is the same: either low or high quadword of the 128-bit field is selected)."

The two directional pads are located on either side of the controller at the top. The ""A"" and ""B"" buttons are located below the pad on the right side and the ""Start"" and ""Select"" buttons are located in the same spot on the left side. What would normally be called ""shoulder buttons"" (""L"" and ""R"") are located behind the area where the pads are, on the back of the controller, functioning more as triggers."
"In more traditional 2-dimensional games, the two directional pads are interchangeable. For others with a more 3D environment, like ""Red Alarm"", ""3D Tetris"", or ""Teleroboxer"", each pad controls a different feature. The symmetry of the controller also allows left-handed gamers to reverse the controls (similar to the Atari Lynx)."
"One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back. It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system. This can be substituted with a wall adapter, though a ""slide on"" attachment is required for the switchout. Once the slide on adapter is installed, a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power."
"During development, Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play. The system's EXT (extension) port, located on the underside of the system below the controller port, was never officially supported since no ""official"" multiplayer games were ever published, nor was an official link cable released.

= = = Nintendo 64 technical specifications = = =
"This article describes the processor, memory, and other components of the 1996 Nintendo 64 home video game console. It then goes on to explain the specs of the Nintendo 64's components in more detail, and details the sub components therein."
"The Nintendo 64's central processing unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300, a licensed variant of the 64-bit MIPS Technologies R4300i, itself a cost-reduced derivative of the MIPS R4200. Built by NEC on a 350 nm process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16 KB for instructions, 8 KB for data). Although a floating-point unit exists as a logical coprocessor, there is no dedicated physical FPU datapath on the VR4300; instead, the integer pipeline is shared for this purpose, meaning that floating-point instructions will stall the pipeline. The 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"With a clock rate of 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 is generally considered to be the most powerful console CPU of the fifth generation of video game consoles. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retains the computational abilities of the 64-bit MIPS R4200, though few titles take advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game titles generally use faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these are sufficient to generate 3D scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space, which came at a premium with contemporary technology. The CPU is constrained by a 562.5 MB/s bus to the system RAM, and in order to access the RAM, the CPU must go through the Reality Coprocessor (RCP), and can not use DMA to do so as the RCP can. This issue is further compounded by the RDRAM's high access latency."
"Programs emulating the Nintendo 64 benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host. Most of these emulators perform the majority of calculations at 32-bit precision and trap the few subroutines that actually make use of 64-bit instructions."
"Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI coprocessor, named the Reality Coprocessor, or RCP. The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and the Reality Signal Processor (RSP). Each area communicates with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s of bandwidth. The RSP is a MIPS R4000-based 128-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing the chip's functions to be significantly altered by each software title if necessary, to allow for different types of work, precision, and workloads. A number of microcodes were provided by Nintendo, while a few companies, such as Rare and Factor 5, would later develop their own microcodes. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, and triangle setup. The Reality Display Processor is primarily the Nintendo 64's pixel rasterizer, and also handles the console's Z-buffer compute."
"The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen (who later founded ArtX in 1997). The RCP was manufactured by NEC, using its 350 nm 3LM CMOS process, which NEC had introduced in 1994. The processor contains 2.6million transistors manufactured using this process. The processor has a size of 81 mm², giving it a transistor density of over 32,000 per square mm."
"Instead of a discrete sound processor, the RSP frequently performs audio functions, although the CPU can be tasked with this as well. It can play back most types of audio (dependent on software codecs) including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is theoretically capable of a maximum of 100 channels of PCM at a time, but only in a case where all system resources are devoted to audio. It has a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. In practice, however, storage limitations caused by the ROM cartridge format limit the audio size and thus quality. Some game titles are designed for higher quality audio when storage expansions are available, as with ""F-Zero X Expansion Kit""."
"The RDP performs rasterization, converting images into raster format before output to the display. The RCP also provides the CPU's access to main system memory via a 562.5 MB/s bus. Unfortunately, this link does not allow direct memory access for the CPU. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"The final major component in the system is the random-access memory, or RAM. Following its design heritage in SGI supercomputing, the Nintendo 64 implemented a unified memory architecture (UMA), instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, as seen on its competitors. The RAM itself consists of 4.5 megabytes (0.5 MB for anti-aliasing) of Rambus RDRAM, fabricated by NEC. System RAM is expandable to a total of 9 MB with the Expansion Pak. The RAM has a 9-bit data bus at 250 MHz; as RDRAM transfers data at both the rising and falling edge of the signal (a technique also known as DDR), it provides the system with 562.5 MB/s peak bandwidth, shared between CPU and RCP."
"Rambus technology was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth at a relatively low cost. The narrow bus makes board design easier and cheaper than the higher width data buses required for high bandwidth out of slower-clocked RAM types (such as VRAM or EDO DRAM); this way, the N64 mainboard could be designed with only 2 layers. However, RDRAM, at the time, came with a very high access latency. The combination of high bandwidth and high latency meant that significant effort was required from developers to achieve optimal results. Early N64 revisions use two 18 Mbit RAM chips; in ca. 1998 these were replaced with a single 36 Mbit chip, same as was used on the Expansion Pak."
"The Nintendo 64 Game Pak ROM cartridges are much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers of many games, such as Nintendo EAD's ""Super Mario 64"" or Factor 5's ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine""."
"The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. This is accomplished through the proprietary ""MULTI OUT"" connector on the rear of the system, which was carried over from the SNES and later reused on the GameCube. Although the digital-to-analog converter chip used in early models had the capability to produce RGB video, it was not connected by default for this purpose, and later revisions lacked the pin connections for this purpose entirely."
"The system came bundled with a composite cable (labeled Stereo A/V cable by Nintendo). Available separately (and included with the system in the UK) were a RF modulator and switch set (for connection to older televisions) and an official S-Video cable, although the latter was only sold at retail stores in Japan. In the U.S., the official S-Video cable could only be ordered direct from Nintendo of America, while in PAL territories, no S-Video cable was officially sold altogether. Furthermore, Nintendo omitted several components from the S-Video signal path in PAL consoles, meaning that using an unmodified NTSC S-Video cable will result in an overbright, garish image, or no image at all."
= = = Dot book = = =
"A dot book (also dotbook or dot-book or drill book) is a small notebook utilized by marching bands (especially high school show bands and drum corps) in order to aid the learning of formations on a field. The dot book was invented by Leslie Allard, a prominent high school band instructor and all-star percussionist. The name is derived from the use of dots on drill sheets which symbolize players on the field: a dot book focuses on the owner's particular dots and other marchers the player may have to guide (use to determine an adjusted location)."
"The general layout of a dot book contains the ""longitudes"" and ""latitudes"" of an American football field. However, a cartesian coordinate system (x/y) is rarely used, rather an alternative system of plotting players as dots on a grid and some jargon is used. For instance, a player may write: ""3 inside 45R and 5 in front BH."" This would mean that the player is 3 steps inside (towards the 50 yard line) from the 45th yard line from the right side (facing the press box) and is five steps in front of the back hash (see Field and players of American football for an explanation of terms)."
"Many times, however, a person's own dot book will contain their own specialized shorthand to represent their location on the field. Dot books can vary from simple (providing only the location of the marcher) to complex (also providing the location of nearby marchers whom you are guiding). This poses problems when players are switched between positions on the field: switching dot books is often difficult and many times players end up rewriting their dot books."
"Dot books are considered essential by many high school band instructors to the progress of drill. Severe penalties can be incurred for forgetting or losing one's dot book. Dot books also become irreplaceable as a season moves on: whenever drill is changed or a visual is added, the dot book becomes the sole record of this change. Loss of a dot book can result in the need for the band to readjust something that had been handled several months prior."
"This is a sample page of a pack of drill sheets. The owner of this page is AS10, and their dot on the field has been circled accordingly. After looking at this page, AS10 wrote in their page on the dot book at the top of this article. Several notable features:"
"An alternative to the dot book is the coordinate sheet. Like dot books, coordinate sheets are small and meant to be worn around the neck on a lanyard. Coordinate sheets are set up as a list of the member's places on the field, given in coordinates (such as 5 steps inside the right 45 yard line and 2.25 steps in front of the Home hash), each ""set"" numbered. Also on the sheet is the number of steps it takes to go from one set to another, but this isn't written plainly. Set 1 always has a ""0"" by it. If it should take sixteen counts to move to the next set, a ""16"" will be placed next to Set 2's coordinates. If it should take eight counts to move to the third set, a ""24"" is next to Set 3's coordinates."
= = = Paul DePodesta = = =
"Paul DePodesta (born December 16, 1972) is an American football executive and former baseball executive who is the chief strategy officer for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as a front-office assistant for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and New York Mets. DePodesta was also general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The year after leading the Dodgers to their first playoff win in 16 years, he was fired after the 2005 club finished with its worst record in 11 years. He was the ninth general manager in the club's history since its move to Los Angeles. He is also known for his appearance in the book and movie ""Moneyball"" about his time with the Athletics."
"DePodesta is a native of Alexandria, Virginia, where he grew up with Thad Levine. He attended Episcopal High School ('91) and then Harvard University, where he played baseball and football and graduated in 1995 with a degree in economics. He has worked for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League and the Baltimore Bandits of the American Hockey League."
"In 1996, DePodesta got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he spent three seasons. He served as an advance scout for two years and in his final month with the club was appointed special assistant to general manager John Hart."
"In 1999, he joined the Oakland Athletics organization as an assistant to general manager Billy Beane. DePodesta was a key figure in Michael Lewis's book ""Moneyball"". The book thrust the analytical principles of sabermetrics into the mainstream."
"At the age of 31, DePodesta was named general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 16, 2004, making him the fifth-youngest general manager in baseball history, behind Jon Daniels (28) of the Texas Rangers, Theo Epstein (28) of the Boston Red Sox, Andrew Friedman (28) of the Tampa Bay Rays, and Randy Smith (29) of the San Diego Padres."
"DePodesta's reliance on sabermetric principles has been somewhat controversial. He is often considered part of a new breed of front-office executives whose personnel decisions depend heavily on analysis of performance data, often at the perceived expense of more traditional methods of scouting and observation."
"One of DePodesta's most notable moves was made at the 2004 trading deadline. He traded catcher Paul Lo Duca, relief pitcher Guillermo Mota and outfielder Juan Encarnación to the Florida Marlins in exchange for pitcher Brad Penny, first baseman Hee Seop Choi and pitcher Bill Murphy, in what was reportedly an attempt to pick up pieces to acquire pitcher Randy Johnson from the Arizona Diamondbacks. DePodesta was heavily criticized in the local and national baseball media for this trade, because Lo Duca was thought to be the ""heart and soul"" of the team. The Dodgers made the playoffs anyway, with Penny developing into one of the better pitchers in the National League during his stint with the Dodgers, which lasted until the end of the 2008 season. Choi, however, was a disappointment, batting just .161 in 2004 and .253 in 2005, and striking out 80 times in 320 at bats. Bill Murphy was traded that year to acquire Steve Finley, who hit 13 homers in 58 games, including a memorable grand slam that clinched the division title. Lo Duca played through 2005 with the Marlins and then went to the New York Mets, the Washington Nationals and back to the Marlins, making his final Major League appearance in September 2008."
"During the 2004 off-season, Adrián Beltré, who had hit 48 home runs in 2004, signed with Seattle as a free agent, spurning DePodesta's offer of 3 years for $30 million for Seattle's offer of 5 years for $64 million. DePodesta signed J. D. Drew, Jeff Kent, and Derek Lowe. Drew enjoyed two productive seasons as a Dodger and then used an opt-out clause in his contract to sign a new 5-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. Both Kent and Lowe put in four productive seasons for the Dodgers and cut ties with the franchise at the end of the 2008 season with Kent retiring and Lowe signing a contract with the Atlanta Braves."
"Coming off the successes of 2004, the 2005 season saw the Dodgers lose a number of players to significant stints on the disabled list. Many of the players lost to injury were expected to produce heavily for the team, including J. D. Drew, Milton Bradley, Éric Gagné, Jayson Werth, César Izturis and Odalis Pérez. The 2005 season resulted in the team's worst record since 1992 and second worst since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. On October 29, 2005, Dodgers owner Frank McCourt fired DePodesta, citing his desire to see the club win and that DePodesta had not met those expectations. Reports surfaced that the real reason McCourt had fired DePodesta was his inability to find satisfactory managerial candidates to replace Jim Tracy. He was later replaced by Ned Colletti, who hired Grady Little as manager. Some have speculated that McCourt fired DePodesta in response to media criticism from ""Los Angeles Times"" sports columnists T.J. Simers and Bill Plaschke, who were vehemently ""anti-Moneyball"" and referred to DePodesta pejoratively as ""Google Boy."""
"On June 30, 2006, DePodesta was hired as the Special Assistant for Baseball Operations for the San Diego Padres and was promoted to Executive Vice President on November 10, 2008."
"On November 8, 2010, DePodesta was hired as the vice president of player development and scouting for the New York Mets by general manager Sandy Alderson, with whom DePodesta worked when Alderson was CEO of the Padres."
"On January 5, 2016, DePodesta was hired by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) as their chief strategy officer."
"In 2003, author Michael Lewis was interested in how Oakland Athletics general manager (GM) Billy Beane tried to find quality players to improve the team while struggling with one of the smallest payrolls in Major League Baseball. He first wanted to write an article on the subject, but the idea eventually blossomed into a book named """". Lewis's interests included how Beane hired DePodesta as his assistant to incorporate sabermetrics, an approach that consists of more sophisticated analyses of baseball statistics, which is at least partially credited for their 2002 20-game winning streak which set an American League record."
"Lewis's book examines the lives and careers of various baseball personalities and explains the art of sabermetrics. Bill James, who coined the term sabermetrics for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), is also a major focus. James published ""The Bill James Baseball Abstract"" from 1977 to 1988 and wrote several sabermetrics books. Beane and DePodesta had studied James's work and were inspired by his knowledge of baseball analysis."
"DePodesta did not feel comfortable in the spotlight after the book's release, nor did he care for the secrets revealed about his scouting methods. The book earned DePodesta a reputation as a cold calculator, choosing players based only on their numbers. In addition, he was thought of as a guy who knew nothing of ""real baseball."""
"In reality, DePodesta played football in college and wanted to be a football coach, seen in a photo wearing number 17. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in economics, he became an intern for the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions in 1995. In early 1996, he got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he worked as a scout. In October 1996, at age 24, he was promoted to the position of advance scout. In October 1998, he became assistant to the General Manager for the team. Those experiences led to him being hired by Beane as his assistant with the Oakland A's in November 1998."
"When the movie ""Moneyball"" was adapted from the book, DePodesta did not approve of the way his character was portrayed. ""There were a handful of things. Some were factual, others were more ephemeral."" He had no objection to Jonah Hill's performance. ""Jonah was awesome. He was so respectful of me and my time. It would have been flattering to be portrayed by someone of his expertise. It had nothing to do with the casting,"" DePodesta said in 2010. ""I just could never get comfortable with the idea of somebody else portraying me to the rest of the world. Like any movie, to make it interesting, there has to be some conflict there. In some respects, a lot of the conflict is going to revolve around my character, and that was never really the case in reality,"" he said in 2011. He also talked about the caricatural focus it brought on him, first in 2003 and again in 2011. ""The other problem was I wasn't all that interested in the attention. It had already happened from the book. And I didn't necessarily need to relive it."""
"The role was originally going to be given DePodesta's name and portrayed by Demetri Martin, but DePodesta did not want his name or likeness to be used in the movie, so the character was named Peter Brand. Brand is a composite of Beane's assistants in Oakland, not an accurate representation of any specific person. But ""Moneyball""s director, Bennett Miller, has credited DePodesta for being generous and helpful in the making of the film. Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance."
"DePodesta is married to artist and philanthropist Karen Deicas and has three sons and a daughter. In 2016, Deicas launched the Sports Mind Institute, which seeks to connect lessons learned from figures in professional sports, athletes, team executives, and coaches, to help others apply them to life and the business sector. The family resides in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California."
"On December 13, 2012, DePodesta was elected to the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation. He has also served as a keynote speaker at numerous business conventions and been recognized by several publications, including ""Baseball Prospectus"" and ""Fortune Magazine"", which named him one of the Top 10 innovators under the age of 40."

"The Agreement among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa (also known as the Tripartite Accord, Three Powers Accord or New York Accords) granted independence to Namibia from South Africa and ended the direct involvement of foreign troops in the Angolan Civil War. The accords were signed on 22 December 1988 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by the Foreign Ministers of People's Republic of Angola (Afonso Van-Dunem), Republic of Cuba (Isidoro Malmierca Peoli) and Republic of South Africa (Roelof F. Botha)."
"In 1981 Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs for newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan, had developed a linkage policy. It tied apartheid South Africa's agreement to relinquish control of Namibia, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, and to retreat from Angola, to Cuba's withdrawing its troops from Angola. On 10 September 1986 Cuban president Fidel Castro accepted Crocker's proposal in principle. The South African government also accepted the principle of linkage; it proposed the concept at the UN 7th Plenary Meeting on 20 September 1986 (the Question of Namibia)."
"The concept was strongly rejected by a Cuban-backed majority, with representatives strongly stating their opposition to the effect of, ""... The UN... Calls upon South Africa to desist from linking the independence of Namibia to irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola as such linkage is incompatible with the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978);..."""
The Angolan and United States governments started bilateral talks in June 1987 while the civil war continued. There is disagreement amongst historians on how the various parties agreed to come to the table:
"In the words of Chester Crocker, ""Watching South Africa and Cuba at the table was like watching two scorpions in a bottle."""
"After refusing direct talks with Cuba, the US agreed to include a Cuban delegation in the negotiations, who joined on January 28, 1988. The three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9 in London. The South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May expecting UN Security Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister Magnus Malan and President P.W. Botha asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only ""if Russia and its proxies did the same."" They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. On 16 March 1988, the South African ""Business Day"" reported that Pretoria was ""offering to withdraw into Namibia – not from Namibia – in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon."" However the UN plenary meeting of 1986 indicates that the South Africans were linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal. The Cuban negotiator, Jorge Risquet, announced that Cuba would stay in Angola until the end of apartheid, probably also as a negotiation ploy. (Apartheid did not end until more than 4 years after Cuba left Angola)."
"The Cubans suggested that the U.S. was worried whether the Cuban forces would stop their advance at the Namibian border. Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, rejected the South African demands, noting that ""South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield."""
"According to the book ""32 Battalion"" by Piet Nortje, during this campaign South Africa introduced its new secret weapons, the G5 and G6 howitzer guns. The cannons can fire a projectile over with a high degree of accuracy. The guns were used to halt the Cuban advance to the south and raised the specter of yet another unaffordable arms escalation between two medium-sized military powers. The South Africans assert that the new weapon raised Cuba's fear of more casualties in a war where Cuban fatalities had outnumbered South African fatalities by a factor 10. Conversely, the Cuban air force held air superiority, as was demonstrated by the bombing of the strategic Calueque complex, and the overflights in 1988 of Cuban Mig-23's of Namibian airspace. According to David Albright, South Africa believed that the discovery of preparations for a nuclear weapon test at the Vastrap facility created an urgency amongst the superpowers to find a solution."
"The negotiations reached a deadlock that was broken by the South African negotiator, Pik Botha, who convinced Jorge Riquet that, in the words of Botha ""...We can both be losers and we can both be winners..."" Pik Botha offered a compromise that would appear to be palatable to both sides while emphasising that the alternative would be detrimental to both sides."
"While the hostilities in Angola continued, the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. Finally all approved an outline agreement of ""Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in South Western Africa"" on 20 July. During the negotiations, the South Africans were asked to release imprisoned ANC activist Nelson Mandela as a sign of goodwill, which was denied. A ceasefire was finally agreed upon on August 8, 1988. Mandela remained in prison until 2 February 1990, when South Africa lifted the ban on activities of the ANC African National Congress."
"The negotiations were finalised in New York with Angola, Cuba and South Africa signing the accord on 22 December 1988. It provided for the retreat of South African forces from Angola, which had already taken place by 30 August; the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia; and Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola within 30 months."
"The agreement followed the American linkage proposal which had also been pushed by South African on numerous occasions in 1984 and in 1986 (the UN plenary meeting). Namibia was to gain independence on terms that South Africa had set out, including multi-party democracy, a capitalist free-market economy, and a transition period."
"The South African Army left Angola by 30 August 1988, before the conditions for Cuba's withdrawal had been agreed. Cuban troops began withdrawing on 10 January 1989, and the withdrawal was finalised in stages one month early on 25 May 1991."
"The Angolan government offered an amnesty to UNITA troops under the premise that UNITA would be integrated into the MPLA under a one-party state economy. That concept was rejected by UNITA. The situation in the country was anything but settled, and civil war continued for more than a decade."
"According to ""Presidents of Foreign Policy"" by Edward R. Drachman and Alan Shank, a series of meetings and accords between UNITA and the MPLA, brokered by various African leaders, failed horribly. UNITA was insulted by MPLA's insistence on a premise of a one-party state. A combination of MPLA dismay of intervention from the USA (backing UNITA and forcing a shift in power) led to the MPLA dropping the one-party state and opening the door to a multi-party democracy, with the inclusion of UNITA as a competing party. After some 18 years of war, that was a tremendous breakthrough."
"The elections were declared ""generally"" free and fair by the UN, with the MPLA gaining just under 50% of the vote. However UNITA, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said that the election had been neither free nor fair. Following the Halloween Massacre, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi directed UNITA forces to take up arms again against the MPLA. However, the US now opposed UNITA, instead pressuring Savimbi to accept the election results. The war ended after Savimbi's death, in 2002."
"In preparation for independence, free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote. Namibia gained independence in March 1990. SWAPO was originally a Marxist party that intended to install a one-party state. The South African government rejected that premise until the fall of the Soviet Union and SWAPO assured that it would support a multi-party democracy with a capitalist, free market economy."
South Africa held onto Namibia's economic port of Walvis Bay for an additional 18 months until it was assured that SWAPO would respect the newly-founded constitution and the principle of a multi-party democracy.

"The octahemioctacron is the dual of the octahemioctahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the hexahemioctacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."

= = = Crambe abyssinica = = =
Crambe abyssinica is an annual oilseed crop of the family Brassicaceae. It is mainly cultivated due to the high levels of erucic acid that are contained in its seeds. The crambe oil is used for industrial purposes and its side products can be partly used as animal feed.
"""C. abyssinica"" has its origins in eastern Africa and was domesticated in the Mediterranean region. It grows up to a height between 0.5 and 2m, depending on field conditions. Its cropping cycle is rather short, ranging from 90 to 100 days. Usually, its straight stalk is moderately branched and its leaves are of an oval shape. The plant’s flowers are small and white, arranged in racemes and have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter and four longer free stamens, what is typical for Brassicaceae. Mostly, these flowers are self-pollinated, but some cases of cross-pollination have been observed. Its indehiscent fruits enclose only one spherical seed that contains around 26% protein, 18% fibre and 35% oil. This oil content is lower than what can be extracted from rapeseed and the oil is not edible. The pericarp of the seed usually adheres to the seed even at harvest."
"Crambe has not been in cultivation for a long time. It was probably cultivated for the first time in the 1930s in the former USSR. Later the crop was tested in other regions of the USSR, in Sweden and in Poland, where crambe was grown on 25’000 ha after the second world war. Research efforts in northern and eastern Europe were increased and the agronomical characteristics and industrial uses of crambe were intensively studied. By successive selection within ""C. abyssinica,"" conventional breeding started in the 1950s in some European countries. Hereby improved strains were introduced to Canada and the United States. Further selection and crossing of different accession led to the release of new varieties in the 1970s. Through introgression of wild populations and mass selection two new cultivars were created in the 1980s which were promoted as high yielding source of erucic acid. In the 1990s a breeding program was started in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, after a period of great efforts to bring crambe into extended cultivation, interest in the crop in Europe has declined in recent years ."
"With a germination temperature of 6 °C which is also equivalent to the basal growing temperature, ""C. abyssinica"" is a winter crop in southern Europe and subtropical areas whereas it is cultivated as spring crop in northern Europe and more continental areas. The optimal growing temperature is approximately 15 °C. It tolerates annual average temperature between 5.7 and 16.2 °C and frost down to -6 °C. Because of its ability to get along with only 350mm of precipitation, ""C. abyssinica"" is considered to be relatively drought tolerant. Nevertheless, drought stress during the development stages of flowering and grain filling reduces productivity. Cultivation is possible up to an annual precipitation of 1200mm. Crambe has modest demands regarding soil properties, it tolerates soil pH from 5.0 to 7.8. Low soil depth and a high stone and gravel content decrease drought tolerance."
"Seeds of many improved varieties are available on the market and are sown at a rate of approximately 120 seeds per m and at a depth of 5-15mm. Seed maturation is uniform and the 1000 seed weight varies between 6.0 and 7.5g. Management procedures from sowing to harvesting can be conducted largely with the same machinery used for common cereals. Yield levels vary widely between 1100-1600kgha in Russia, 450-2500kgha in the U.S. and 600-2400kgha in Germany."
"""C. abyssinica"" can be easily inserted in crop rotations with a requirement of 1600 growing degree-days. Its rotation contingent should not exceed 25%. Because of similar soil requirements and increased soil borne pathogen pressure, cultivation directly after other Brassicaceae species should be avoided as well as cultivation after artificial grassland and fallows due to an enriched soil seed bank of potential weeds and regarding the limited pre-emergence weed management methods."
"""C. abyssinica"" is cultivated for a wide range of industrial purposes. The interest lies mainly in the high erucic acid content (55-60%) of its seed oil and makes the crop a competitive option to other oil plants as industrial rapeseed. The composition of crambe oil gives this product several special traits, such as high smoke point, good wettability of different materials and high viscosity. In addition, its oil has a higher biodegradability than mineral oils. Therefore, erucic acid derived compounds are used as additives in the plastic industry, high temperature hydraulic fluids, waxes, base for paints and coatings, lubricants and many other products. Furthermore, the extracted seed oil is used in pharmaceutical products and cosmetics."
"The crambe meal, which is a side product of industrial oil production, can be used as a protein supplement for animal feed. It contains approximately 46% proteins, which are of high nutritional quality. Unfortunately, the crambe seed shred also contains toxic compounds as glucosinolates, tannins and inositol phosphate. The use as forage is therefore very limited. The incorporation rate of crambe by-products into animal feed should not be higher than 5% for growing-finishing pigs, 15% for dairy cows, and 19% for sheep. It is not recommended to feed poultry."
"To accommodate the widening of the autobahn from its original four lanes to six, a supplemental bridge was added to the north to accommodate the northbound, Salzburg – Munich carriageway.

= = = Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial = = =
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States that commemorates those American nurses who died in the Spanish–American War in 1898. The rough-hewn, grey granite memorial was erected by the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses on May 2, 1905. It stands in the southwestern corner of Section 21, where the first Spanish–American War nurses are buried."
"The memorial should not be confused with the Nurses Memorial. This tall marble figure of a nurse in a nurse's uniform and cape was erected in 1938. It also stands in Section 21, a short distance away. It is screened from the northern part of Section 21 by a copse of trees."
"The Spanish–American War was a ten-week conflict that occurred in the spring and summer of 1898. Cuba had been waging a war of independence against Spain since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States (which had extensive economic interests on the island). To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the battleship to Havana in late January 1898. The ""Maine"" exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15. American newspapers whipped up war fever, and held Spain responsible for the ship's destruction. The United States Congress enacted a joint resolution demanding independence for Cuba, and President William McKinley signed it into law on April 20. In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations on April 21. The same day, the United States Navy began a blockade of Cuba. Spain declared war on April 23. On April 25, Congress declared that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had existed since April 21."
"The Spanish–American War began on April 25, 1898, and ended on August 12, 1898. Cuban and Spanish dead vastly outnumbered American deaths. While 2,910 American military personnel died during the war, just 345 were combat deaths. The rest died of disease. The U.S. military barred women from serving in any capacity prior to the war. Although the Army had 791 nurses, they were all male, and far too few to provide the medical care needed. Soldiers resisted being transferred from combat units into the nursing corps, and few volunteers signed up for medical duty. Congress quickly authorized the military to hire female nurses—but on contract, not as military personnel. The army reached out specifically to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a patriotic society, to recruit women nurses. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, one of the medical doctors practicing in the United States, was asked to lead the DAR's recruitment effort. Of the 1,563 nurses recruited for the new Nurse Corps, most served in hospitals in the United States. Only 76 were sent to Cuba, 30 to the Philippines, nine to Puerto Rico, six to Honolulu, and eight served aboard the hospital ship . It was the first time in American history where nurses were fully accepted in military hospitals."
"Although no nurses were killed in combat, 140 died of typhoid and 13 from other diseases. (One of the 13 died of yellow fever after being experimented upon by the army.) Since nearly all the nurses died in the United States, most were sent home to their families for burial. A handful died overseas, and were buried there. On July 8, 1898, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the repatriation of American dead, and appropriating funds for this purpose. Additional legislation was enacted on February 9, 1900; May 26, 1900; and June 6, 1900. Many of the dead were buried at Arlington National Cemetery, either because their families desired it or the remains could not be identified."
"The first Spanish–American War nurse to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery was Anna H. Campos, who died in Cuba on September 2, 1899. Her remains were repatriated about May 1900. By February 1901, the military had repatriated a few of the bodies of nurses who had died overseas. For families which wished it, or where remains went unclaimed or unidentified, the bodies were buried at Arlington. These nurses were buried in what is now Section 21. Over time, more military nurses were buried next to them, creating a ""nurses' section"". The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. In late 1906, Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey, Sr., Quartermaster General, gave permission for any Army nurse who wished to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors."
"In June 1899, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee co-founded the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses to (among other things) commemorate the service of contract nurses during the Spanish–American War and serve as an advocate for nurses within the U.S. military. At the founding convention on August 7, 1899, Order members agreed to sponsor a $10,000 ""Nurses' Monument"" ($ in dollars) to military nurses at Arlington National Cemetery. Order dues were 25 cents ($ in dollars), and the organization proposed that any dues money left over after the organization's expenses were paid should go toward the monument. By October 1, an additional $158.75 ($ in dollars) in contributions had been raised."
"Approval for the memorial was not quickly forthcoming. A memorial committee was established by the Order of Spanish War Nurses, chaired by Miss Esther Hasson of New York. But by November 1901, the Secretary of War Elihu Root had not yet given approval for the memorial. Fundraising, too, was going slowly, and only $265.63 ($ in dollars) was in the order's memorial fund. The order received word that the Army had set aside a site near the western corner of what is now Section 21 for the memorial in late 1902. But this decision was not a formal one. In the late summer of 1903, however, Dr. McGee received assurance from Secretary of War Root and Quartermaster General Humphrey that the order could erect a memorial in Section 21. However, General Humphrey requested that order erect a simple, artistic monument rather than anything elaborate."
"At the order's annual meeting on August 22, 1903, the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses debated the nature of the memorial they wished to erect. The original intent of the order was to honor all trained nurses, untrained ""immune"" nurses, Catholic sisters, male contract nurses, and any enlisted hospital corpsmen buried in the section. But none of these were actually buried at Arlington in the section assigned for the memorial. In fact, by July 1903, only two immune nurses and two soldiers were buried in Section 21. President McGee said members had expressed their disinclination to commemorate all nurses from all wars buried at Arlington, and the order was barred from erecting a memorial to itself. McGee proposed that the memorial honor all female nurses from the Spanish–American War (whom she called ""our comrades""), or just trained female nurses. She asked the delegates to consider the issue, and make an explicit choice when it voted the following day."
"Later that day, the Committee on Monument issued its report to the membership Committee chair Esther Hasson noted that several designs had been submitted, including one from Tiffany & Co. (although the process for requesting designs was not reported in the media). The cost of the more elaborate memorials was in the $3,000 range ($ in dollars). However, Hasson said, Quartermaster General Humphreys had indicated in July 1903 that the Army's preference was for a simple stone memorial with an inscription, a design which would cost less than $1,000 ($ in dollars). The committee noted that this eliminated any memorial incorporating a bronze tablet, bas-relief figures, or elaborate carving. The committee noted that its preference was for a simple monument approximate in size and cost to that suggested by the Army. The Monument committee submitted a resolution proposing that the monument fund be raised to $3,000 ($ in dollars); that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to produce a monument acceptable to the committee and the Secretary of War as quickly as possible; and that this monument be dedicated to ""deceased army nurses in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia"". The motion passed. The chair immediately appointed Miss Amanda J. Armistead, Miss Isabelle J. Walton, Miss Edith H. Rutley to the Special Committee on Monument."
"On August 23, the Special Committee on Monument made a verbal report to the order (the contents of which were not revealed in the media), which was followed by vigorous discussion. But the members voted to delay action until next annual meeting in September 1904."
"By November 1903, the memorial fund stood at only $346.66 ($ in dollars)."
"The 1904 annual meeting of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses was scheduled for early September at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. However, at the request of Dr. McGee, the meeting was postponed until November 7, 1904 (although the meeting location was not altered). When the order met in St. Louis, the membership voted unanimous to erect a nurses' memorial with all due speed. But no design for the monument was chosen. The total cost of the memorial was also not reported, but Dr. McGee requested that each member donate $2 ($ in dollars) to bring monument fund to amount needed. By November 1, 1904, just $187 ($ in dollars) had been raised, bringing the monument fund to $546.84 ($ in dollars)."
"By mid-December 1904, the Special Monument Committee of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses had yet to choose a design, even though many members favored the figure of a nurse."
"Time began to press on the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses. More than six years had elapsed since the monument was first proposed, and donations were only trickling in. Eighteen months had passed since the Secretary of War gave his consent to erect a monument, and there seemed little reason to believe that more time would allow the order to construct a grander memorial. In early 1905, the order contracted with Barclay Bros., a granite company in Barre, Vermont, to produce the memorial."
"The dedication for the Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial was set for 3:00 P.M. on May 2, 1905. The Order of Spanish–American War Nurses established a dedication committee to plan the memorial's unveiling. The committee had great difficulty in getting speakers to commit to the ceremony, and in setting a program. They were successful, however, in persuading Colonel Charles P. Morton, commander of the 7th Cavalry at Fort Myer, to provide a military band."
"The dedication ceremony was not elaborate, but it was symbolic. A temporary pole made of bamboo from the Philippines was erected next to the memorial, and palm branches from Cuba and Puerto Rico were bunched about its base. At the top of the pole was a laurel wreath festooned with red, white, and blue ribbons. Around the foot of the monument, more palm branches were spread. An honor guard of 25 veterans from the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Spanish War Veterans stood around the memorial."
"Dignitaries at the event included Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee (who presided over the ceremony); M. Emmett Urell, Colonel, USA (ret.), past commander of the Grand Army of the Republic; Dr. Clifford Cox, commander, Spanish–American War Veterans; Mrs. Emily N.R. McClean, president, Daughters of the American Revolution; surviving Civil War nurses from Washington, D.C. (all members of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War); Colonel Morton and several U.S. Army and U.S. Navy officers; and a representative from the Embassy of Japan. A marquee was erected near the memorial site to shelter them."
"The dedication ceremony was simple. Father Thomas McGuigan of St. Patrick's Catholic Church provided an invocation. Dr. McGee spoke briefly, followed by Dr. Cox. A poem by Rudyard Kipling was read, and then 15-year-old Klotho McGee (Dr. McGee's daughter) unveiled the monument as the 7th Cavalry Band played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". Mrs. McLean delivered a lengthy address as the highlight of the ceremony. An Army chaplain gave a benediction, and a bugler from Fort Myer played ""Taps""."
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is located along the southwestern edge of Section 21 in Arlington National Cemetery. Porter Avenue runs southeast-to-northwest in front of the memorial, while Lawton Avenue is a short distance to the north. Porter and Lawton Avenues meet McPherson Avenue near where the memorial lies. The Battle of the Bulge Memorial is a few feet away to the northwest."
"While the history of colonization and marginalization is not unique to the Americas, the practice of deriving sports team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples of North America is a significant phenomenon in the United States and Canada. The popularity of the American Indian in global culture has led to a number of teams in Europe also adopting team names derived from Native Americans. In Asia, Africa, Australia and South America, the adoption of indigenous names generally indicates that the team members are themselves indigenous. While there are team names in North America derived from other ethnic groups, such as the Boston Celtics, the New York Yankees, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Minnesota Vikings, these are names selected by immigrant/settler groups to represent themselves."
"The rise of indigenous rights movements has led to controversy regarding the continuation of practices rooted in colonialism. Such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. Such practices are seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities, which have the a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that creates a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against ""hostile and abusive"" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students."
"The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington."
"Little League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting ""the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature."" This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians."

= = = Coucher de soleil no. 1 = = =
"Coucher de soleil no. 1 (also called Landscape, Paysage, Landschap, or Sunset No. 1) is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is a work executed in a mosaic-like Divisionist style with a Fauve palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory."
"""Coucher de soleil"" was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the Salon des Indépendants (n. 3457), along with ""Bacchante"" and four other works by Metzinger."
"The painting had been in the collection of Helene Kröller-Müller since 1921 or prior, now in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands."
"""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100 cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ""J.Metzinger"" (lower right), and titled on the verso ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"". Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships."
"The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond. The plants to the lower left resemble the agave, a species found in the south of France, Spain and Greece. ""Agave"" is also the name of three characters in Greek mythology:"
The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of public nudity propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.
"In this luscious setting—as in ""Luxe, Calme et Volupté"" by Henri Matisse—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the spectrum of visible light. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present."
"Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ""La danse (Bacchante)"" or ""Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape"": (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ""Two Nudes in a garden"", 91.4 x 63.8 cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ""Coucher de soleil no. 2"" or ""No. 3"", the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ""Landscape with Fountain"", for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6 cm; ""Paysage pointilliste"", 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73 cm; ""Matin au Parc Montsouris"", ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7 cm; or even ""La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil"", 54 x 73 cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905."
"Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began painting portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum."
"The Fauves (many of whom would become Cubists), were heavily influenced by Neo-Impressionism, calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the Impressionists. The Symbolists too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ""reflect"" light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet."
"Metzinger's response in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists."
"The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini."
"The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ""Sunset No. 1"". ""Neo-Impressionism"" wrote Paul Adam, ""wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction."""
"By ""abstract,"" writes Robert Herbert, ""writers and painters of the period did not mean ""devoid of reference to the real world"", as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ""idea"", and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue."""
"By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Cézanne, Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism."
"Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ""Coucher de soleil"" and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:"
"The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ""Paysage au disque"" (1906-1907), writes Herbert, ""is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..."""
"""The Neo-Impressionists"" according to Maurice Denis, ""inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."""
"In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The Poincaré homology sphere, also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the 3-sphere itself, with a finite fundamental group. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented."

"The Huntsville Fire was an American professional indoor soccer team based in Huntsville, Alabama. The Fire played in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League during both of the league's seasons from 1997 to 1998. They played their home games in the Von Braun Center. The team began the 1997 season as the Florida-based Daytona Beach Speedkings before financial struggles forced a sale early in the season."
"During their existence, the Fire/Speedkings played a combined total of 52 games, winning 29, two via shootout, and losing 23, two via shootout. They scored a total of 810 goals and allowed a total of 702 goals and notched 87 total standings points out of a possible 156 points. The EISL awarded 3 standings points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation."
"The team, a charter member of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League, was founded as the Daytona Beach Speedkings. They played their home games at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, under the direction of coach Scott Cooper. The team played the first-ever game in EISL history, losing to the Savannah Rug Ratz in front of a ""disappointing"" crowd of 600 fans. Despite having a winning record (5–3) and the league's top offense, the team failed to draw fans and suffered financially. Before the season, team owner Blake Cullen told the ""Orlando Sentinel"" that the team would need to average about 3,000 fans per game to break even. The team's official home attendance average was 609 per game but the bulk of those were complimentary tickets with the SpeedKings selling fewer than 200 tickets per game."
"This failure prompted Cullen to sell the team to Major League Indoor Football, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, who announced the team would relocate to the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In just three weeks the new management headed by team president Bryan Dresden, moved the team from Daytona Beach opening to an inaugural crowd of over 2500 new fans in Huntsville, Alabama. The renamed Huntsville Fire finished the season with a record of 13 wins and 11 losses, including 1 shootout win. This gave the team a total of 38 points for the 1997 season and 4th place in the seven-team league."
"The Fire returned for the 1998 season. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins and 12 losses (including 1 shootout win and two shootout losses) for 49 points. This placed them 3rd overall in the seven-team league. The Fire made the playoffs, losing to the Mississippi Beach Kings 2 games to 1 in the semi-final round. The Fire averaged 2,535 fans per game, fourth-best in the EISL where the average league game saw 2,733 fans in attendance."
The party's provincial governments faced attacks from leftists and Maoists who advocated armed conflict to take land from landlords and feudals. These attacks were allegedly on the behest of leftists within the Pakistan People's Party.
"On March 23, 1973, the Federal Security Force, a paramilitary force under the alleged orders of Bhutto, attacked a public opposition rally at the Liaquat Bagh in the town of Rawalpindi and killed a dozen people; many more were wounded by their automatic gunfire. Wali Khan narrowly escaped a bullet during the attack. Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies on the streets in Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly with their bereaved families."
Following the massacre the Federal Security Force launched a crackdown against the party that led to many senior leaders including Ajmal Khattak to flee into exile to Kabul.
"The Balochistan government immediately faced multiple crise,s the first of which was when the Balochistan police department, mostly officered by people from Punjab or Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving. Despite this fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister, moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile as a qualification and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar."
Unable to exercise any effective authority Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organization to assist in security.
The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra-tribal conflict. The Baloch nationalists declared that it was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan but without evidence to prove the statements issued.
"However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government, fresh from the humiliation of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to dismember Pakistan and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973, in protest against the decision the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government resigned in protest. Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders."
"In the face of an increasingly strong national campaign led by the NAP against the government, Bhutto banned NAP on February 8, 1975 after the murder of his close colleague Hayat Khan Sherpao, throwing thousands of its workers and much of its leadership, including party President Khan Abdul Wali Khan, in jail for alleged anti-state activities."
"Invoking the 1st amendment of the 1973 constitution the government charged Wali Khan and his colleagues under the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case in 1976, although they were acquitted of the charge of the murder of PPP stalwart Hayat Khan Sherpao, the decision to ban the NAP was upheld by the courts. In addition to Khan Abdul Wali Khan, the case also implicated two governors, two chief ministers, scores of national and provincial parliamentarians, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Kaswar Gardezi, Habib Jalib (Urdu revolutionary poet) and Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Balochi Revolutionary Poet/Leader) and even some of Bhutto’s former colleagues, many of whom were later re-elected and became federal or provincial ministers."
"With the NAP leadership largely imprisoned, a new political party was formed on the wreckage of the NAP in 1976 by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. Named National Democratic Party (NDP), it was headed by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Hyderabad case was withdrawn after General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law in July 1977. Wali Khan left party affairs to Sher Baz Mazari after his release from jail in 1979. The party faced a split at that time between far left elements led by Khair Bakhsh Marri advocating outright separation and armed struggle and those advocating political struggle led by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The split ended the alliance between Pashtun Nationalists and Baloch Nationalists that Wali Khan had formed in 1969 and led to the formation of the Pakistan National Party."
Sherbaz Khan Mazari led the NDP into joining the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. The alliance with former rivals the PPP did not go down well with Ghaffar Khan who encouraged by Governor Fazle Haq warned Ghaffar Khan of what would happen if the PPP returned to power.
This move led to a split between Mazari and Wali Khan which were aggravated after Wali Khan in a statement rejected the 1973 constitution and Wali Khan's election as NDP President.
The NDP was merged with other nationalist parties from Balochistan and Sindh in 1986 in Karachi to launch a new political party named Awami National Party with Wali Khan as its president and Rasul Bux Palejo as its general-secretary.

The avenue begins at Athanasios Diakos Street and Michalakopoulou Street and the southbound portion of the avenue runs with three lanes to the southern portion of Athens and eastern Dafni. The two nearest Athens Metro subway stations that lie within this avenue are Agios Ioannis, Dafni and Agios Dimitrios (opened in 2004) and part of the southern section of the Red Line runs underneath the avenue. It has an intersection with the road linking with the Hymettus Ring of the Attiki Odos motorway and Katechaki Avenue. It also has several intersections in Glyfada and with the Vari-Koropi Avenue."

"The TalkOrigins Archive is a website that presents mainstream science perspectives on the antievolution claims of young-earth, old-earth, and ""intelligent design"" creationists. With sections on evolution, creationism, geology, astronomy and hominid evolution, the web site provides broad coverage of evolutionary biology and the socio-political antievolution movement."
"The TalkOrigins Archive began in 1994 when Brett J. Vickers collected several separately posted FAQs from the talk.origins newsgroup and made them available from a single anonymous FTP site. In 1995, Vickers, then a computer science graduate student at the University of California at Irvine, created the TalkOrigins Archive web site. In 2001, Vickers transferred the TalkOrigins Archive to Wesley R. Elsberry, who organized a group of volunteers to handle the maintenance of the Archive."
"In 2004, Kenneth Fair incorporated the TalkOrigins Foundation as a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Foundation's purposes include funding and maintaining the TalkOrigins Archive and holding copyrights to Archive articles, thereby simplifying the process of reprinting and updating those articles. The copyright issue has posed a particular problem since the FAQs started off as a small collection with little thought given to copyright but have since mushroomed. In 2005, the Foundation was granted tax-exempt status by the IRS."
"The FAQs and FRAs (Frequently Rebutted Assertions) on the TalkOrigins Archive cover a wide range of topics associated with evolutionary biology and creationism. These include Mark Isaak's Index to Creationist Claims, a list of creationist positions on various issues, rebuttals, and links to primary source material. The TalkDesign site fulfills a similar role with the Intelligent Design movement. Also hosted is Jim Foley's Fossil Hominids sub-site which studies the evidence for human evolution and has an extensive list of links to websites on both evolutionary biology and creationism. Lastly, the Quote Mine Project examines the use of Quote miningtaking quotes out of contextby creationists. The feedback system collects reader comments and posts a compilation, along with responses, each month. The archive maintains a sister site which addresses Intelligent Design arguments."
"As Pope developed the game, he regularly posted updates to TIGSource, a forum for independent developers, and got helpful feedback on some of the game's direction. He also created a publicly available demonstration of the game, which further had positive feedback to him. Pope opted to try to have the game submitted to the Steam storefront through the user-voted Greenlight process in April 2013; he was hesitant that the niche nature of the game would put off potential voters and had expected that he would gain more interest from upcoming gaming expositions. However, due to attention drawn by several YouTube streamers that played through the demo, ""Papers, Please"" was voted through Greenlight within days."
"With new attention to the project, Pope estimated that the game would now take six months to complete, though it ultimately took nine months. One area he expanded on was to create several unique character names for the various citizens that would pass through the game. He opened up to the public to supply names, but ended up with over 30,000 entries, with more than half he considered unusable as they did not figure the types of Eastern European names he wanted or were otherwise ""joke names"". After the Greenlight process, Pope started to add other features that required the player, as a lowly checkpoint worker, to make significant moral decisions within the game. One such design was the inclusion of the body scanner, where Pope envisioned that the player would recognize this being an invasion of privacy but necessary to detect a suicide bomber. These also helped to drive the game's narrative as to provide rationale for why the player as the passport checker would need to have access to these new tools in response to the larger events in the game's fiction. After being successfully voted on Greenlight, ""Papers, Please"" was being touted as an ""empathy game"", similar to ""Cart Life"" (2011), helping Pope to justify his narrative choices. Pope also recognized that not all players would necessarily appreciate the narrative aspects, and started to develop the ""endless"" mode where players would simply need to process a queue of immigrants limited only by the player making a certain number of mistakes."
"Pope released the game on August 8, 2013 for Windows and OS X systems, and for Linux machines on February 12, 2014."
"Pope had ported the game to the iPad, and was considering a port to the PlayStation Vita though noted that with the handheld, there are several challenges related to the game's user interface that may have to be revamped. The Vita version was formally announced at the 2014 Gamescom convention in August 2014. With the iOS release, Apple required Pope to censor the full body scanner feature from the game, considering the aspect to be pornographic content. However Apple later commented that the rejection was due to a ""misunderstanding"" and allowed Pope to resubmit the uncensored game by including a ""nudity option"". The iPad version was subsequently released on December 12, 2014. The Vita's version was released on December 12, 2017."
"By March 2014, Pope stated that he was ""kind of sick to death"" of ""Papers, Please"", in that he wanted to continue to focus on more smaller games that would only take a few months of time to create and release, and had already spent far too much in his mind on this one. He expected to keep supporting ""Papers, Please"" and its ports, but had no plans to expand the game or release downloadable content, but does not rule out revisiting the Arstotzka setting again in a future game."
"""Papers, Please"" received positive reviews on release, receiving ""generally favorable reviews"" from 40 reviews on Metacritic. ""Papers, Please"" has been praised for the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction. CBC News' Jonathan Ore called ""Papers, Please"" a ""nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters – all from a desk job"". Simon Parkin writing for ""The New Yorker"" blog declared ""Papers, Please"" the top video game of 2013. He wrote: ""Grim yet affecting, it’s a game that may change your attitude the next time you’re in line at the airport."" Some critics received the story very well: Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of The Escapist's series ""Zero Punctuation"" lauded the game for being a truly unique entry for 2013 and even made it one of his top five games for that year; he cited the game's morality as his reasoning by explaining that ""[""Papers, Please""] presents us constant moral choices, but makes it really hard to be a good person... while you could waive the rules to reunite a couple [...] you do it at the expense of your own family... You have to decide if you want to create a better world or just look after you and yours."""
"""Wired"" listed ""Papers, Please"" as their top game for 2013, recognizing that the game's title, often coupled with the Hollywood representation of Nazi officials stopping people and demanding to see their identification, alongside the drab presentation captured the ideas of living as a lowly worker in a police state. In 2019, the game was ranked 45th on ""The Guardian"" newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list."
"Some critics reacted against the paperwork gameplay. Stephanie Bendixsen from the ABC's game review show ""Good Game"" found the game ""tedious"", commenting ""while I found the issues that arose from the decisions you are forced to make quite interesting, I was just so bored that I just struggled to go from one day to the next. I was torn between wanting to find out more, and just wanting it all to stop."""
"""Papers, Please"" is considered by several journalists as an example of video games as an art form. ""Papers, Please"" is frequently categorized as an ""empathy game"", a type of role-playing game that ""asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds"", as described by Patrick Begley of the ""Sydney Morning Herald"", or as described by Pope himself, ""other people simulators"". Pope noted that he had not set out to make an empathy game, but the emotional ties created by his scenarios came about naturally from developing the core mechanics."
""""" includes an Easter egg to ""Papers, Please"", when its protagonist Nathan Drake compares a line of people waiting at a passport station to the situation in Arstotzka. A nod to ""Papers, Please"" was briefly shown on the episode ""Playtest"" of the series ""Black Mirror"", where a fictional cover of ""Edge"" includes a cover story regarding ""Papers, Please III""."
"""Papers, Please"" won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, ""Excellence in Narrative"", and ""Excellence in Design"" awards at the 2014 Independent Games Festival Awards and was nominated for the Nuovo Award. The title also won the ""Innovation Award"" and ""Best Downloadable Game"" at the 2014 Game Developers Choice Awards. The game won ""Best Simulation Game"" and was nominated in the categories of ""Best Game"", ""Game Design"", and ""Game Innovation"" at the 2014 BAFTA Video Games Awards."
"As of March 2014, at the time of the BAFTA awards, Pope stated that the game had sold 500,000 copies. By August 2016, three years from release, Pope stated that more than 1.8 million copies had been sold across all platforms."
"Two Russian filmmakers, Liliya Tkach and Nikita Ordynskiy of Kinodom Productions, developed an 11-minute live-action film based on ""Papers, Please"", entitled ""Papers, Please: The Short Film"", starring Igor Savochkin as the passport inspector. The film was authorized by Lucas Pope after Ordynskiy sent him the screenplay via email. The film premiered at the Trekhgorka House of Culture in Moscow, Russia, on January 27, 2018. The film debuted worldwide via YouTube and the Steam storefront on February 24, 2018. The film received ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews on Steam upon its release. The short film's success led Tkach and Ordynskiy to pursue a similar short film for ""Beholder"", another game set in a totalitarian state. Ordynskiy would later voice Seaman Aleksei Toporov in ""Return of the Obra Dinn"", a 2018 video game developed by Pope, which was also a Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner."

The Moondials experience was a pleasant one for Jackson, and it took a great deal of work for nominal Belle & Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch to convince him to join his group. At the time, Murdoch was playing the open mic circuit in Glasgow as a solo act, and it was at one of these performances, at The Halt Bar, that Jackson first saw Murdoch play."

"Christopher B. Galvin (born March 21, 1950) is an American businessman. He served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Motorola from 1997 to 2003."
"Christopher Galvin is the grandson of Paul Galvin, the founder of Motorola, and the son of Robert Galvin, who served as CEO of Motorola from 1959 to 1990. He received his BS in political science from Northwestern University and his M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University."
"From 1967 to 1973, during college, Galvin held part-time summer assignments at Motorola. From 1973 to 1983, he served full-time positions in sales, sales management, marketing management and mobile two-way radio product management, taking leave 1975–77 to attend graduate business school full-time. From 1983 to 1985, he became marketing director then general manager of the Tegal semiconductor equipment unit owned by Motorola Inc. In 1985, he became vice-president and director of Motorola's radio paging Division, where he sponsored the team that created one of the first virtually completely automated manufacturing operations in the US, called Project Bandit. Galvin was promoted to corporate vice-president and general manager of paging. In 1988, he was named chief corporate staff officer of the corporation, later senior vice president and appointed to the Policy and Operating Committees of Motorola Inc. In 1990, he was promoted to assistant chief operating officer and joined as the third member of the office of the CEO of Motorola Inc. In 1993, he was elevated to president and chief operating officer. In 1997, he became CEO. In 1999, he added the role of chairman of the board to that of CEO."
"Following the dot.com crash in 2000, he led a massive three-year restructuring of Motorola that included large lay-offs, closure of manufacturing facilities and reducing break-even costs. Simultaneously, Galvin led the renewal of Six Sigma Quality through Digital Six Sigma and introduced Motorola's MOTO language advertising campaign in 2002. The RAZR cellular phone was designed by Galvin's innovators in new product development methodologies created during the 2001–2003 timeframe. RAZR was introduced July 27, 2004. The innovations behind the RAZR was so cutting edge that even Galvin's eventual successor, Ed Zander, stated “There was a small team developing the RAZR before I got there. When I saw the technology, it blew me away.”"
"On September 19, 2003, the board of directors announced publicly it would seek another CEO. Galvin stated his objection to the board's view of Galvin's turnaround efforts, and stated, ""The Board and I do not share the same view of the pace, strategy and progress at this stage of the turnaround.”"
"Sixteen working days later, on October 13, 2003, Motorola Inc. reported that its global customer new product orders were up 25% company-wide and up 44% for cellular mobile phones in Q3 2003 compared to Q3 2002. Similarly, on January 20, 2004, Motorola Inc. reported on Galvin's last full quarter serving as CEO and the quarter of the board's search for a new CEO, Q4 2003, that Motorola's collection of global telecom, semiconductor, automotive, broadband-media and public safety customers increased new product line orders by 42% and by 64% in their cellular mobile phone business compared to Q4 2002."
"He was forced to resign on January 4, 2004. Seventy-seven working days later, on April 20, 2004, Motorola announced its financial performance for Q1, 2004, the quarter of Galvin's departure. The data showed that the then $30 billion run rate in annual revenue resulted in a 42% increase in sales corporatewide revenue growth, a 532% improvement in operating earnings, $0.9B in pre-tax earnings, $0.7B in free cash flow, and a resulting $0.9B net cash position on the balance sheet. Motorola Inc.’s cellular mobile phone business recorded an uptick of 67% sales revenue growth ($4.1B in quarterly sales) and earned a 9.8% operating margin for the period, three months before the RAZR phone was to be announced. At the time Motorola Inc.’s business portfolio included four Fortune 500 sized multi-billion business sectors compared to its six business sectors at the time. Zander, who assumed the CEO role on January 5, 2004, stated after the announcement of Q1 2004 financial results ""The first 90 days I talked to everybody. My agenda was very simple: learning the business as fast as I could. I did not want to shoot from the hip."""
"The following quarter, the financial performance initiated by Galvin proved sustainable and repeatable. On July 20, 2004, Motorola reported Q2 2004 results of increased sales revenue growth by 41% to $8.7B, an improvement in operating earnings by 394%, $800 M in pre-tax earnings, $800 M in free cash flow, and a $1.8B net cash position on the balance sheet. The cellular mobile phone business recorded an increased sales revenue growth of 67%, equating to $3.9B in quarterly sales while maintaining a 10.2% operating margin."
"In 2008, several years after Galvin's departure, a study was completed by the Monitor-Global Business Network consulting company to identify and compare the best + $5B in revenue global high tech corporate turnarounds since 1990. In comparing six-year periods including three years of turnaround actions and the corresponding companies’ resulting financial performance, the study placed Galvin's turnaround of Motorola as one of the top five large high tech turnarounds. The companies compared were IBM, Apple, Xerox, HP and Motorola."
"In 2010, he was featured in the Andrea Redmond book ""Comebacks: Powerful Lessons from Leaders Who Endured Setbacks and Recaptured Success on Their Terms"" (), which details his unplanned departure from Motorola, and how he responded."
"In 2014 Alan Murray, deputy managing editor and executive editor, online for ""The Wall Street Journal"", posted his review of ""Boards that Lead"", published by Harvard Business Review Press. The authors were Ram Charan, business advisor, Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Korn Ferry, and Michael Useem, professor at the Wharton Business School. Murray wrote, “Not all the book’s examples are success stories. Inevitably, Messrs. Charan, Carey and Useem devote a few pages to monumental failures. The authors tell the story of the board of Motorola Inc., which the authors blame for destroying the company. In 2004, it pushed out CEO Christopher Galvin (a grandson of the founder) just as his strategy was starting to deliver success, then replaced him with CEOs who enjoyed some early successes based on Mr. Galvin’s efforts, and then presided over the company’s decline and breakup.” The authors attribute this blunder to not backing a bet on solid technology or strategy, of which investment in technology had been the heart and soul of the Motorola culture, and having a reflexive response to the demands of investors, some of whom where short-term traders."
"After departing Motorola, he served as chairman of Navteq Inc. (2004–2008). In mid-2004 Navteq Inc. went public with an IPO. In July 2008, Navteq closed a $8.1B gross cash sale to Nokia generating a positive 255% return to shareholders in at the time of Navteq's IPO."
"Prior to Cleversafe's sale to IBM in late 2015, Galvin was chairman of Cleversafe Inc., a digital storage company. IBM paid more than $1.3 billion in cash acquire Cleversafe Inc., thereby adding data-storage software that works for both public and private cloud-computing systems. This was IBM's largest deal in 2015."

= = = Earl of Bellomont = = =
"Earl of Bellomont, in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came on 9 December 1680 when Charles Kirkhoven, 1st Baron Wotton, was made Earl of Bellomont. He had already been created Baron Wotton, of Wotton in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 31 August 1650. He was childless and both titles became extinct on his death in 1683."
"The second creation came on 2 November 1689 Richard Coote, 2nd Baron Coote, later Governor of New York, was made Earl of Bellomont. He was the son of Richard Coote, who had been created Lord Coote, Baron of Coloony, in the County of Sligo, in the Peerage of Ireland on 6 September 1660. Lord Coote was a younger son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and the younger brother of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (see Coote baronets for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Bellomont was succeeded by his elder son, Nanfan, the second Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the third Earl. The earldom became extinct when the latter died without surviving male issue in 1766."
"The late Earl was succeeded in the barony of Coote by his first cousin once removed, Charles Coote, who became the fifth Baron. Charles was the son of Charles Coote (1695–1750), Member of Parliament for County Cavan, son of the Honourable Thomas Coote, a Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), younger son of the first Baron. On 4 September 1767 the earldom of Bellomont was created for the third time when Charles was made Earl of Bellomont (although the title was probably erroneously spelled ""Bell""a""mont"" in the letters patent). On 18 May 1774 Lord Bellomont was created a Baronet, of Donnybrooke in the County of Dublin, in the Baronetage of Ireland, with remainder to his illegitimate son Charles Coote. On his death in 1800 the barony and earldom became extinct as he left no surviving legitimate male issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his illegitimate son, Charles, the second Baronet (see Coote baronets for further history of this title)."

"Mihailo Marković, PhD (; 24 February 1923 – 7 February 2010) was a Serbian philosopher who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s as a proponent of the Praxis School, a Marxist humanist movement that originated in Yugoslavia."
"A co-author of the SANU Memorandum, Marković was a prominent supporter of Slobodan Milošević in the late 1980s and 1990s."
"Marković was born in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He became a member of the youth organization of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the KPJ itself. As a partisan he actively participated in the struggle for liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II."
"Marković took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on ""The Concept of Logic"". In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966–1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Marković was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975–1985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983."
"In his honour, a collection of articles entitled ""Philosophy and Society"" was published in Belgrade in 1987."
"After the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Marković took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His ""Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR"", published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia."
"In the 1960s Marković became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal ""Praxis"". Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Marković was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Marković worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986."
"As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Marković, together with Vasilije Krestić and others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation."
"Marković was vice-president of the Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party."
= = = Small rhombihexahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small rhombihexahedron (or small rhombicube) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 18 faces (12 squares and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is an antiparallelogram."
This polyhedron shares the vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the convex rhombicuboctahedron (having 12 square faces in common) and with the small cubicuboctahedron (having the octagonal faces in common).
It may be constructed as the exclusive or (blend) of three octagonal prisms.
= = = Small cubicuboctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U. It has 20 faces (8 triangles, 6 squares, and 6 octagons), 48 edges, and 24 vertices. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"The cubicuboctahedron is a faceting of the rhombicuboctahedron. Its name comes from that the square faces lying on the planes corresponding to the rhombic dodecahedron, has been replaced by six octagonal faces parallel to the square faces of the cube."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with the stellated truncated hexahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the small rhombihexahedron (having the octagonal faces in common)."
"As the Euler characteristic suggests, the small cubicuboctahedron is a toroidal polyhedron of genus 3 (topologically it is a surface of genus 3), and thus can be interpreted as a (polyhedral) immersion of a genus 3 polyhedral surface, in the complement of its 24 vertices, into 3-space. (A neighborhood of any vertex is topologically a cone on a figure-8, which cannot occur in an immersion. Note that the Richter reference overlooks this fact.) The underlying polyhedron (ignoring self-intersections) defines a uniform tiling of this surface, and so the small cubicuboctahedron is a uniform polyhedron. In the language of abstract polytopes, the small cubicuboctahedron is a ""faithful realization"" of this abstract toroidal polyhedron, meaning that it is a nondegenerate polyhedron and that they have the same symmetry group. In fact, every automorphism of the abstract genus 3 surface with this tiling is realized by an isometry of Euclidean space."
"Higher genus surfaces (genus 2 or greater) admit a metric of negative constant curvature (by the uniformization theorem), and the universal cover of the resulting Riemann surface is the hyperbolic plane. The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane has vertex figure 3.8.4.8 (triangle, octagon, square, octagon). If the surface is given the appropriate metric of curvature = −1, the covering map is a local isometry and thus the ""abstract"" vertex figure is the same. This tiling may be denoted by the Wythoff symbol 3 4 | 4, and is depicted on the right."
"Alternatively and more subtly, by chopping up each square face into 2 triangles and each octagonal face into 6 triangles, the small cubicuboctahedron can be interpreted as a non-regular ""coloring"" of the combinatorially ""regular"" (not just ""uniform"") tiling of the genus 3 surface by 56 equilateral triangles, meeting at 24 vertices, each with degree 7. This regular tiling is significant as it is a tiling of the Klein quartic, the genus 3 surface with the most symmetric metric (automorphisms of this tiling equal isometries of the surface), and the orientation-preseserving automorphism group of this surface is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), equivalently GL(3,2) (the order 168 group of all orientation-preserving isometries). Note that the small cubicuboctahedron is ""not"" a realization of this abstract polyhedron, as it only has 24 orientation-preserving symmetries (not every abstract automorphism is realized by a Euclidean isometry) – the isometries of the small cubicuboctahedron preserve not only the triangular tiling, but also the coloring, and hence are a proper subgroup of the full isometry group."
"The corresponding tiling of the hyperbolic plane (the universal covering) is the order-7 triangular tiling. The automorphism group of the Klein quartic can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the polyhedron, namely ""exchanging the two endpoints of the edges that bisect the squares and octahedra) to yield the Mathieu group M."

= = = Manchester Square = = =
"Manchester Square is an 18th-century garden square in Marylebone, London. Centred north of Oxford Street it measures internally north-to-south, and across. It is a small Georgian predominantly 1770s-designed instance in central London; construction began around 1776. The north side has a central mansion, Hertford House, flanked by approach ways; its first name was Manchester House — its use is since 1897 as the Wallace Collection (gallery/museum) of fine and decorative arts sits alongside the Madame Tussauds museum and Wigmore Hall concert rooms as single-greatest tourist attractions of Marylebone. The square forms part of west Marylebone, most of which sees minor but overarching property interests held by one owner (through lease reversions managed as the Portman Estate) among which many buildings have been recognised by statutory protection (as listed buildings)."
Among residents figured:
"This six-house long approach fronts the east side of Hertford House (or its small public front lawn with steps, benches and paths). The first five buildings of Spanish Place are those listed, in the mainstream, initial category of Grade II. They were built c.1780-90, associated with the Duke of Manchester's development of the square, on Portman land. Their materials are brown brick, recessed slate roofs above five varying-prominence storeys with 3-window wide fronts. They have semicircular arched doorways to right; panelled doors with sidelights and fanlights; one a stuccoed Doric porch. Their windows are recessed sashes, in stuccoed reveals, under flat gauged arches. Reaching out below the first floor is a stucco plat band, painted stone or stucco cornice over the next, then a stucco cornice and blocking course marking the attic storey. Original, cast iron, geometric patterned balconies adorn the first floor. Cast iron area railings with urn finials enclose the front. №3 has a blue plaque as the home of Captain Marryat and George Grossmith."
"In 1814 and 1815 the square was the chosen setting for cheaper newspapers and, above all, their inner page articles to perpetuate a fresh round of the urban myth of a pig-faced woman."
"The cover photograph for ""Please Please Me"", the first LP by The Beatles, was taken by Angus McBean in 1963. It showed the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House here, EMI's London headquarters (now demolished). A repeat photo was taken in 1969 for the cover of their then-intended ""Get Back"" album; it was not used when the project saw release as ""Let It Be"", but was eventually used on the retrospective albums ""1962–1966"" and ""1967–1970""."
"In the early 20th century, the chemical company ICI moved into a new headquarters in the north-west corner of the square, which was designed in a modern style with classical elements. Around the rest of the square stand tall brick Georgian terraced houses, many of which are inside converted to offices."

= = = BBC National Programme = = =
"The BBC National Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced the earlier BBC radio station 5XX – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company (later to be nationalized as the British Broadcasting Corporation) began transmissions on 14 November 1922, the technology for both national coverage and joint programming between transmitters did not exist – transmitter powers were generally in the region of 1 kilowatt (kW)."
"From 9 July 1924, however, the company began experimenting with higher power longwave transmissions from the Marconi company's site near Chelmsford in Essex, using the call sign 5XX. The experiments proved successful and on 27 July 1925 the Chelmsford longwave transmitter was relocated to a more central site at Borough Hill near Daventry in Northamptonshire. This provided a ""national service"" of programmes originating in London, although it remained somewhat experimental and was supplementary to the BBC's locally based services, including its main London station, 2LO."
"Initially the national programme was transmitted on 187.5 kHz longwave but this was later changed, with the opening in 1934 of a new high-power longwave transmitter site at Droitwich, to 200 kHz, which was to remain the BBC's longwave frequency until 1978, when it was moved slightly to 198 kHz. Mediumwave transmitters were used to augment coverage."
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high power mediumwave transmitter at the Daventry 5GB site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service programmed from London for the majority of the population. This came to be called the BBC National Programme."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme"", and eventually resulted in the gradual extension throughout the 1930s of a separate BBC Regional Programme."
"The local stations were gradually either converted to regional relays or closed entirely and replaced by high-power Regional Programme transmitters. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX, initially these were on three separate frequencies in order to minimise interference, but by 1939, as the Regional Programme network expanded, the National Programme's three remaining mediumwave transmitters – at Brookmans Park (for London and the South East), Moorside Edge (for The North), and Westerglen (for Central Scotland) – were all using 1149 kHz."
"The National Programme's broadcasting hours were from 10.15am until Midnight Mondays to Saturdays, with Sundays commencing broadcasting at 3.00pm, however by the mid 1930s broadcasting on a Sunday was extended to commence at around 10.30am."
"BBC News on the National Programme would not air until at least 6.00pm each day. This was in agreement with the newspapers, so to ensure people would buy a morning newspaper. The national programme did not have a dedicated news department until 1934, and only then was it used to edit and broadcast news material from other wire agencies in the country and around the world. The start of the second world war in September 1939 would see the start of a proper news service on the new BBC Home Service with morning news bulletins commencing at 7.00am each day."
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The main transmitter network was synchronized between just two groups, using 668 and 767 kHz, each of which could be turned off during air raids to prevent its signals being used as navigational beacons (with listeners required to retune in such an event to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz)."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but retained the name ""BBC Home Service"". On the same date, the BBC Light Programme was launched, taking over the style and much of the function, as an entertainment channel, of the BBC Forces Programme (which had begun broadcasting in 1940), as well as the Droitwich 200 kHz longwave frequency which had been used by the pre-war National Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light music than its successor, the Home Service."
"Ting (old Norse: þing) means assembly. It first came into being during Viking times and was formed by the freemen of the community, and it generally numbered about a hundred men. Tings were necessary in the clan-based society of Northern Germany and Scandinavia, because they allowed for inter-clan wars to be resolved or prevented through the mediation of the ting. It also served as the place for religious rites and trade negotiations."
Landstinget is also the Danish name for the modern Parliament of Greenland.
"Under the Constitution of 1849, the requirements for the right to vote was the same for the two houses, however the requirements for electability were stricter for Landstinget; candidates were limited to those of age 40 and above and they were required to have a substantial income. The house originally had 51 members, all elected indirectly. The voters elected a group of electors for each constituency, and the electors elected the members of the house. The members were elected for a term of eight years; however, terms were staggered so that half of the seats were up for election every four years."
"With the Constitution of 1866, the electoral system was reformed. The number of seats was increased to 66 of which twelve were appointed by the king for a period of twelve years, and one by the Faroese Løgting. The remaining 53 were elected indirectly."
"In Copenhagen, half the electors were elected by the voters paying the largest amount of tax, and the other half by all the voters. In the rest of the country, one elector was elected by the voters in each parish in the countryside and half as many electors were elected in the market towns by the same system as in Copenhagen. Then for each elector elected in the parishes and the market towns, one elector was found among those that paid the greatest amount of tax in the parishes. As the main direct tax of the time was based on real estate and its value as farmland, this system greatly favored manor owners. The result was a conservative majority lasting 35 years, until the 1902 election."
"The next reform of the electoral system came with the Constitution of 1915, and the first election under this system was the 1918 election. Women were given the right to vote, the number of seats was increased to 72, the number of constituencies was reduced to seven, and the system of royally appointed members was replaced by 18 members elected by the resigning Landsting for a period of eight years."
"Although a 1939 referendum that would have replaced Landstinget with another chamber—the Rigsting—and simplified the legislative process, failed due to a low voter turnout, the bicameral system and thereby Landstinget was abolished when the current constitution was approved in a 1953 referendum."
= = = M. Clifford Townsend = = =
"Maurice Clifford Townsend (August 11, 1884 – November 11, 1954) was the 35th Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1937 to 1941. During his term he led relief efforts during and after the Great Flood of 1937."
"Maurice Clifford Townsend, known as Clifford to his friends and family, was born on a farm in Blackford County, Indiana to David and Lydia Glancy Townsend on August 11, 1884. He had one sister, Myrtle, and the two were raised on a country farm. After completing high school in 1901 he worked as a teamster in the oil fields during the Indiana Gas Boom, and later in a factory. In 1907 he entered Marion College in Grant County. After working as a teacher for six years to pay for his education, he graduated in 1907. He then taught in the common schools, and served as school superintendent for different counties between 1909 and 1919."
"He entered politics as a representative in the Indiana House in 1923. His single term in the legislature was focused mostly on reforming the state's tax code, an issue he worked on up through his term as governor. In 1928 he ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress, but was defeated. He then returned to education, serving again as a school superintendent and on the executive committee of the Indiana's Teachers Association in 1929. Townsend's experience in education made Paul V. McNutt consider him as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor and helped him to win the nomination at the state's Democratic convention in 1932."
"He was elected the 33rd Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket and served from 1933 until 1937. The position of Lieutenant Governor was dramatically altered during his term. Previously, the position received only a token salary, only required active work during legislative sessions, which amounted to sixty days every two years. The position was granted significantly more power after the passage of the 1932 Executive Reorganization Act when the position was made head of the state's agricultural department and assigning him other administrative duties. The change put a large number of patronage jobs under his control."
"Townsend's mother placed his name in nomination for governor at the 1936 Democratic state convention. His nomination though, was a tough battle. The Democratic Party was split between three strong faction, with McNutt supporting Townsend, powerful senator Sherman Minton supporting Pleas Greenlee, and the chairman of the state party supporting Kirk McKinney. The fight at the convention was bitter, and a fist fight broke out before the final vote took place. In the end McNutt's control over the party machine determine the nomination in favor of Townsend. The popular McNutt campaigned heavily on Townsend's behalf in the general election. Republicans again made gains in the General Assembly, but Democrat kept the majority and Townsend won the election, defeating Republican Raymond Springer by over 180,000 votes."
"Townsend was inaugurated January 11, 1937. The state was immediately beset with a disaster as the Great Flood of 1937 began. Within a week, every community on the Ohio River was destroyed and hundreds of thousands were homeless. In the early stages, he coordinated evacuation efforts, routing all available trains to carry people to safety as flood waters rose. Thousand of relief workers and the national guard were called out to help rebuild. The disaster remains the second worse to have ever hit the state. Indiana was the only state affected by the flood, and there were no drownings reported. Harry L. Hopkins of the National Relief Administration said, ""No state was better managed during the flood than Indiana."""
"Before the flood relief was completed, a large strike broke out in General Motors factories across the state. Violence broke out in Anderson and the National Guard was called out by Townsend to restore order and protect the factory. The strike prompted Townsend to request the creation of the state Division of Labor to provide voluntary mediation in union strikes. Steel workers in Gary launched a strike in 1937, and the division successfully prevented it from turning violent."
"As the end of his term neared, the former state party chairman Frederick Van Nuys, who had been elected Senator again, attempted take control of the party from the McNutt-Townsend faction. The battle was primarily over who would control federal patronage jobs. President Franklin Roosevelt intervened after Van Nuys opposed his plan to stack the United States Supreme Court, and used his own influence to have Van Nuys defeated in his reelection bid. Townsend at first agreed to go along with Roosevelt's plan, but after McNutt decided it would be to harmful to the state party, Townsend changed his mind, much to Roosevelt's chagrin."
"In the mid-term elections, Republican took the control of the Indiana House of Representatives, 51 to 49. The Republicans blocked Townsend's proposed new social programs, and attempted to roll back many of his predecessor's programs. The Senate blocked the bills from passage, and the session ended in deadlock. Only a few pieces of legislation were passed: the driver's license examination became required by law, pensions for the state's firemen were approved, free textbooks were authorized for public schools and the state ordered school buses to be painted yellow for safety's sake—this last starting a nationwide trend."
"After Townsend left office, he extricated himself from internal politics of the state party, and did not involve himself in the selection of his successor. During World War II Townsend used his farm experience in government service, directing the Office of Agricultural War Relations, the Agricultural Conservation and Adjustment Administration, and the Food Production Administration. In 1943 he resigned from federal service and returned to Indiana to manage his farms in Blackford and Grant counties. Townsend was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 1946, but was defeated by William E. Jenner. He died November 11, 1954 from a heart attack, and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Hartford City, Indiana."

"The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a zoo in Roeding Park in Fresno, California covering 39 acres and housing over 190 species. Its attractions include Stingray Bay, Dino Dig, Valley Farm, Sea Lion Cove, African Adventure, and Ross Laird's Winged Wonders Bird Show. The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)."
"The zoo was formed some time around 1908. The earliest zoo record describes a collection consisting of two bears and around fifty birds of various species. According to the zoo's website, ""bears, local cats, hoof stock, and birds were added to the Zoo and housed in log cabin type exhibits."" The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) officially recognized the park opening in 1929 as the Roeding Park Zoo."
"Only few animals were seen, but that number would later rise. The year attendance was around 2,000 and most of the visitors were from Fresno and the surrounding areas."
"The zoo grew substantially in the 1940s and 1950s, with 100 animals and more birds by 1947. The zoo's first foreman, Eldon ""Curly"" Blocker, was hired from the San Diego Zoo. In 1949, the zoo's Asian elephant Nosey (a name determined by a citywide ""Name-the-Elephant"" Contest) was acquired, with help from the Fresno Rotary Club. Her arrival coincided with Fresno's ""49ers Days Rodeo Parade"", and Nosey's presence in that parade was popular enough to spawn the creation of the Fresno Zoological Society, which would create interest in the zoo and provide a fundraising mechanism. In the 1950s, ten large exhibits were added to the zoo grounds with monkeys, sea lions, camels, giraffes, an African bird aviary, a flamingo habitat, and on-site feed and medical compounds. The zoo became an institutional member of the AZA in 1957. In 1965 Paul S. Chaffee was hired as the zoo's first director. In the late 1960s, the animal exhibits were renovated, with climate control being added to increase the comfort of the animals. In 1967, the large bird of prey exhibit was constructed, and in 1968, a master plan for future development was drafted. something to support the rest of this"
"The zoo's area expanded by a third, and new exhibits featuring bison, elk, and prairie dogs were added. In 1976, in honor of the American Bicentennial Celebration, the park's grizzly bear facility was expanded. In 1978, the Park Zoo Trust Fund (distinct from the Zoo Admissions Trust Fund) was established to make sure a portion of concession sales were used to improve the zoo. This freed the zoo from having to approve a budget with the City Council. In 1979, the zoo added the Edward A. Kane Reptile House, the world's first computer-controlled reptile habitat."
"In 1982, Nosey the Elephant's habitat was renovated and three new elephants were brought in. A red wolf exhibit known as Wolf Woods was added in 1984, and the Doris and Karl Falk Wildlife Education Center was completed, becoming part of the zoo's Educational Center. In 1985, the zoo's name changed from the Roeding Park Zoo to the Fresno Zoo. In 1988, the zoo's walk-through rainforest exhibit was added. 1989 saw the addition of a large classroom wing, and the implementation of the Adopt-an-Animal fundraising program. Paul S. Chaffee, the zoo's director since 1965, died in 1990, and the Fresno Zoo was renamed the Chaffee Zoological Gardens of Fresno in his honor. In 1993, Nosey the elephant died at the age of 47."
"In 2004, ""Measure Z"" was passed by the voters (73%) in Fresno to raise money to expand the zoo, and to improve the animal exhibits. The US$150 million project was contingent upon the submission and review of an environmental impact report. The name of the zoo was shortened to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in 2006. In 2007, a traveling ""Stingray Bay"" exhibit visited and attracted large crowds. Several stingrays were bred while they were visiting Fresno. In 2009, a permanent Stingray Bay exhibit was opened, funded by Measure Z. In the rain forest exhibit, the former butterfly house (Maddis House) reopened as the Tropical Treasures exhibit in March 2009, with poison dart frogs and a sloth among other species."
"Osada's placement there was noted in ISU's decision not to continue this dual-grouping policy, because her scores in free skating would have placed her 7th in ""Group A"" in that segment, which would have placed her significantly higher overall. However, she was never given the opportunity to place above 16th in free skate, due to her placement in ""Group B."" By contrast, many strong compulsory figure skaters who were poor free skaters ended up placing high in the end, because they were guaranteed at least a 15th-place finish in free skating, as long as they placed in the top 15 after short program."
"Given the way Osada skated in the 1982–1983 season, many expected her to continue to progress in the world ranks. However, she placed poorly in compulsories at 1983–1984 All Japan Championships, where she finished 4th, costing her the opportunity to compete at the Sarajevo Olympics in 1984. Around this time, Osada experienced a growth spurt, which made her triple jumps less consistent and less dynamic. Although she won a couple of bronze medals at NHK Trophy, she was never able to regain her national title, nor was she able to make the Japanese world or Olympics team. By 1986, she was no longer training seriously, as she shifted her focus to her studies at Hosei University. She retired quietly after the 1989 season."

"Gnohéré's first taste of English football came at Lancashire club Burnley. After a successful trial period at the club, he signed a contract to be a part of Stan Ternent's squad in 2001. 'King Arthur', as he was effectively nicknamed, became a firm fans' favourite at the club with his dominant displays and his excellent runs up the field from defence."
"His finest hour was in a local derby away at Preston North End. He stunned the Lilywhites with two goals, including one from a classy set up from Alan Moore. He was a constant fixture in the Burnley team during the 2001/2002 season, where Burnley looked likely to gain promotion to the Premier League."
"Gnohéré failed to live up to his early form at Burnley in the following seasons and was subsequently released when his contract expired. He joined Queens Park Rangers after an initial loan, but left the club at the end of the 2004/05 season. During his spell at QPR, he scored once in the Football League Trophy against Kidderminster Harriers."
"After a spell out of the game, Gnohéré signed for Oxford United in August 2007. However, after a string of poor performances for the U's and the return of regular defenders from injury, the club decided not to renew his month-to-month contract, and he was released on October 2007."
= = = BglII = = =
"""Bgl""II is a type II restriction endonuclease isolated from certain strains of ""Bacillus globigii""."
"The principal function of restriction enzymes is the protection of the host genome against foreign DNA, but they may also have some involvement in recombination and transposition."
"Like most type II restriction enzymes, ""Bgl""II consists of two identical subunits that form a homodimer around the DNA double helix. Each monomer is 223 amino acids and symmetrically bind both sides of the unique palindromic nucleotide sequence AGATCT, cleaving the scissile phosphodiester bond between the first Adenine and Guanine nucleotides on both strands of the DNA molecule, creating sticky ends with 5' end overhangs."
"Being a type II restriction enzyme, ""Bgl""II does not require ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for its enzymatic function, but only requires association with a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg. Unlike other restriction enzymes of its class, ""Bgl""II has been shown to possess some unique structural characteristics, such as a β-sandwich subdomain, and appears to undergo a unique conformational change upon dimerization, but its overall structure and mechanism of catalysis remain consistent with other type II restriction enzymes."
"Restriction endonucleases play a very important role in modern molecular cloning techniques. Because of their unique recognition/cut sites, restriction enzymes can be used to precisely cut DNA at specific locations in a predictable manner. Once cut, the DNA (usually) possesses so-called ""sticky ends"", which can then allow the DNA fragment to hybridise into a DNA vector. Ligating enzymes are used to covalently link the desired fragment to the vector for subsequent DNA cloning."
"""Bgl""II catalyses phosphodiester bond cleavage at the DNA backbone through a phosphoryl transfer to water. Studies on the mechanism of restriction enzymes have revealed several general features that seem to be true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the phosphodiester bond. Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, as well as a general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O)."
"Although restriction endonucleases show little sequence similarity, crystal structures reveal that they all share a highly similar α/β core consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices, two of which mediate dimerization. This core carries the active site (catalytic center) and the residues that contact DNA in the major groove. ""Bgl""II is unique in that its α/β core is augmented by a β-sandwich subdomain that has several projections that extend outward to grip the DNA, allowing ""Bgl""II to completely encircle the DNA molecule. This atypical feature of ""Bgl""II suggests a unique hinge motion for DNA binding and release."
"Comparative structural studies of the free enzyme vs. the ""Bgl""II-DNA complex showed that the enzyme opens by a dramatic scissor-like motion, accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the α-helices at the dimer interface. These structural studies also revealed that within each monomer a set of residues lowers or raises to alternatively sequester or expose the active site residues. These dramatic differences in structure in the free vs. bound enzyme have yet to be observed in any other restriction endonuclease and may possibly represent a novel mechanism for capturing DNA that may extend to other proteins that encircle DNA."
"Structural studies of endonucleases have revealed a similar architecture for the active site with the residues following the weak consensus sequence Glu/Asp-(X)-Glu/Asp/Ser-X-Lys/Glu. ""Bgl""II's active site is similar to other endonucleases', following the sequence Asp-(X)-Glu-X-Gln. In its active site there sits a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg, that interacts with Asp-84, Val-94, a phosphoryl oxygen, and three water molecules. One of these water molecules, is able act as a nucleophile because of its proximity to the scissile phosphoryl (its orientation being fixed by a hydrogen bond with the side chain amide oxygen of Gln-95) and its contact with the metal cation (which lowers its pK, promoting the water's nucleophilicity)."

"Research within the Schaefer group involves the use of computational hardware and theoretical methods to solve problems in molecular quantum mechanics. His contributions to the field of quantum chemistry include a paper challenging, on theoretical grounds, the geometry of triplet methylene as assigned by Nobel Prize-winning experimentalist Gerhard Herzberg; the development of the Z-vector method simplifying certain calculations of correlated systems; and a wide body of work undertaken in his research group on the geometries, properties, and reactions of chemical systems using highly accurate ""ab initio"" quantum chemical techniques. Many of these papers have predicted, or forced a reinterpretation of, experimental results."
"Schaefer was awarded the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry in 1979 ""for the development of computational quantum chemistry into a reliable quantitative field of chemistry and for prolific exemplary calculations of broad chemical interest"". The Pure Chemistry Award is given to the outstanding chemist in America under the age of 35. In 1983 he received the Leo Hendrik Baekeland award for the most distinguished North American chemist under the age of 40. In 1992, he was awarded the Centenary Prize of the Royal Society of Chemistry, London, with a citation that included ""the first theoretical chemist successfully to challenge the accepted conclusion of a distinguished experimental group for a polyatomic molecule, namely methylene."""
"In 2003, Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Award in Theoretical Chemistry and the Ira Remsen Award of Johns Hopkins University. In 2004, a six-day conference was convened in Gyeongju, Korea on the “Theory and Applications of Computational Chemistry: A Celebration of 1000 Papers of Professor Henry F. Schaefer III.” Schaefer was honored with the $10,000 Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in 2005 by the University of Wisconsin's Theoretical Chemistry Institute, joining a distinguished list of some of the best-known scientists in the field."
"In 2011 Schaefer received the prestigious Ide P. Trotter Prize of Texas A&M University. Previous recipients of the Trotter Prize include Nobelists Francis Crick, Charles Townes, Steven Weinberg, William Phillips, and Roald Hoffmann."
"In 2012 he received a Humboldt Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, and on March 29, 2012 he received the $20,000 SURA Distinguished Scientist Award, given to the outstanding scientist in any field in the 17 southern states of the US, for fulfilling SURA's mission of fostering excellence in scientific research."
In 2013 Schaefer received the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists.
"On March 18, 2014, Professor Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Peter Debye Award in Physical Chemistry."
"In March 2015, Professor Schaefer was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Research Society of India. He returned to India to give his CRSI Honorary Fellow award lecture on February 6, 2016, at Panjab University in Chandigahr."
"Schaefer received the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal on May 8, 2019."
"Schaefer is also an active Protestant Christian educator who regularly speaks to university audiences (over 500 to date), Christian groups and the public on science/faith issues. In 2003, he published ""Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?"", a collection of essays and talks on the subject. A second edition appeared in 2016. He is a member of the Christian Faculty Forum at the University of Georgia."
"On January 25. 2008, Schaefer was invited to present a lecture entitled 'The Big Bang, Stephen Hawking and God' at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, during TECHFEST, Asia's largest technology festival. This evoked a response from a group of six atheist students in the form of handbills. Schaefer was, however, invited to return to IIT Bombay to present an Institute Lecture in February 2014. In 2016, Schaefer was again invited to present a plenary lecture at TECHFEST. His lecture on December 17, ""The Life of a Scientist,"" was presented to a large audience without incident. On December 14, 2018, Schaefer gave another plenary lecture at TECHFEST."
"There has been some controversy concerning the designation of Schaefer as a ""five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize."" The original source of this estimate is a December 23, 1991 cover article from U.S. News & World Report."
"The names of nominees and other information about the Nobel nomination process cannot be revealed for 50 years following the nomination discussions, so such a designation is speculative."
= = = Cubbon Park = = =
"Cubbon Park, officially called Sri Chamarajendra Park is a landmark 'lung' area of Bengaluru city, located () within the heart of the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about . It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts."
"This public park was first named as Meade’s Park after Sir John Meade, the acting Commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in 1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence."
"The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment. Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'."
The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'.
"The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of the park are accessible through walking paths."
The Park is open to the public at all times but the roads around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh environment for morning walkers and exercisers.
Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a total of around 6000 plants/trees. Indigenous species found in the park are:
"artocarpus, cassia fistula, ficus, polyalthias etc., and exotic species such as araucaria, bamboo, castanospermum australe, grevillea robusta, millettia, peltophorum, schinus molle, swietenia mahagoni, tabebuia. sp etc."
"Amongst the ornamental and flowering exotic trees lining the roads in the park are the Grevillea robusta (silver oak)—the first oaks introduced to Bangalore from Australia—and the delonix or the gulmohar tree (bright red flowers with long petals) along the Cubbon road in the park, which is a widely cultivated tropical ornamental tree around the world."
"The avenue of araucarias along with canna beds on either sides of the road from the Central Public Library to Hudson circle, avenue of Swieteninas in the Northern side of the park, the Java fig avenue along the road leading to the Government Museum, polyalthia avenue along the road from Queen Victoria’s statue to King Edward VII's statue and the chestnut tree avenue from the Chamarajendra statue to Siddalingaiah circle are testimony to the botanical richness of the park. Other attractions at the Park are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook."
"The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices) now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to the Museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira Priyadarshini Children’s Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika — the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa Chatter."
"A bandstand, in an octagonal shape made with cast-iron, was built in the early part of the 1900s. Before India’s Independence, the British Royal Air Force used to play western band music at the band stand every Saturday evening."
"An attraction for children is the well planned children's amusement park as part of Jawahar Bal Bhavan, which has the toy train, Puttani Express that runs (0.75 miles or 1.2 km) within the Park, the Doll museum and a boating facility. A 20-million-year-old fossilized tree — a gift from the Geological Survey of India, is also reported at the park."
"Memorials in the form of marble statues in honour of Queen Victoria (installed in 1906), King Edward VII (installed in 1919), Major General Sir Mark Cubbon, Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (installed in 1927) and Sir K. Sheshadri Iyer (installed (in 1913) are seen located in front of the historical buildings within the park."
"The A10 motorway (), also known as the Sebeș–Turda Motorway (), is a partially built motorway in the central-western part of Romania, that when completed will connect the A1 and the A3 motorways, between the cities of Sebeș and Turda, also providing access to Alba Iulia and Aiud. It is planned to be 70 km long, with a total cost of 420 million euro, which is financed in proportion of 85% from the European Union funds, the rest of 15% being insured from the state budget. The motorway is divided into four lots: works for lots 3 and 4 began on 20 May 2014, whereas for the other two lots began in 2015. Since 30 July 2018, it is operational on lots 3 and 4, from Aiud to Turda (28.9 km)."
"The construction is split into the following four segments, the contracts for which have been awarded in December 2013:"
= = = Resilience (engineering and construction) = = =
"In the fields of engineering and construction, resilience is the ability to absorb or avoid damage without suffering complete failure and is an objective of design, maintenance and restoration for buildings and infrastructure, as well as communities. A more comprehensive definition is that it is the ability to respond, absorb, and adapt to, as well as recover in a disruptive event. A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to resist to an extreme event with minimal damages and functionality disruptions during the event; after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even better than the pre-event level."
"The concept of resilience originated from ecology and then gradually applied to other fields. It is related to that of vulnerability. Both terms are specific to the event perturbation, meaning that a system/infrastructure/community may be more vulnerable or less resilient to one event than another one. However, they are not the same. One obvious difference is that vulnerability focuses on the evaluation of system susceptibility in the pre-event phase; resilience emphasizes the dynamic features in the pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases."
"Resilience is a multi-facet property, covering four dimensions: technical, organization, social and economic. Therefore, using one metric may not be representative to describe and quantify resilience. In engineering, resilience is characterized by four Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Current research studies have developed various ways to quantify resilience from multiple aspects, such as functionality- and socioeconomic- related aspects."
"The first influential quantitative resilience metric based on the functionality recovery curve was proposed by Bruneau et al., where resilience is quantified as the resilience loss as follows."
formula_1
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_5 is the time when the functionality full recovers.
"The resilience loss is a metric of only positive value. It has the advantage of being easily generalized to different structures, infrastructures, and communities. This definition assumes that the functionality is 100% pre-event and will eventually be recovered to a full functionality of 100%. This may not be true in practice. A system may be partially functional when a hurricane strikes and may not be fully recovered due to uneconomic cost-benefit ratio."
"Resilience index is a normalized metric between 0 and 1, computed from the functionality recovery curve."
formula_6
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_10 is the time horizon of interest.
"Thomas Tredgold was the introduced the concept of resilience in 1818 in England. The term was used to describe a property in the strength of timber, as beams were bent and deformed to support heavy load. Tredgold found the timber durable and did not burn readily, despite being planted in bad soil conditions and exposed climates. Resilience was then refined by Mallett in 1856 in relation to the capacity of specific materials to withstand specific disturbances. These definitions can be used in engineering resilience due to the application of a single material that has a stable equilibrium regime rather than the complex adaptive stability of larger systems."
"In his paper ""Resilience and Stability of Ecological systems"" (1973), C.S. Holling first explored the topic of resilience through its application to the field of ecology. Ecological resilience was defined as a ""measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between state variables."" Holling found that such a framework can be applied to other forms of resilience. The application to ecosystems was later used to draw into other manners of human, cultural and social applications. The random events described by Holling are not only climatic, but instability to neutral systems can occur through the impact of fires, the changes in forest community or the process of fishing. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. Multiple state systems rather than objects should b studied as the world is a heterogeneous space with various biological, physical and chemical characteristics."

"Kenneth Reid was educated at the independent Loretto School and St John's College, Cambridge where he studied history, then later at the University of Edinburgh where he studied law. It is here where he first met George Gretton, with whom he would collaborate with extensively during his academic career."
"After working as a solicitor, he became a lecturer in law at the University of Edinburgh in 1980 where he was subsequently appointed to the Chair of Property Law in 1994 and then the Chair of Scots Law in 2008."
"Reid's seminal work is his ""The Law of Property in Scotland"" published in ""The Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia"" volume 18 in 1993 and as a book in 1996. He has published widely on property law, as well as on trusts and succession. He has edited several books with Professor Reinhard Zimmermann, including a volume on the history of Scottish private law, a volume comparing Scottish and South African private law and several volumes on aspects of comparative succession law."
"In 1995, he was appointed to the Scottish Law Commission as Commissioner to direct major reforms in property law. He served as a Commissioner until 2005 and was responsible for the reports which resulted in the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004. In addition he authored the discussion papers which led ultimately to the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012. He was appointed CBE for his law reform work.

= = = Abram Petrovich Gannibal = = =
"Abram Petrovich Gannibal, also Hannibal or Ganibal, or Abram Hannibal or Abram Petrov (; 1696 – 14 May 1781), was a Russian military engineer, general, and nobleman of African origin. Kidnapped as a child, Gannibal was taken to Russia and presented as a gift to Peter the Great, where he was freed, adopted and raised in the Emperor's court household as his godson."
"Gannibal eventually rose to become a prominent member of the imperial court in the reign of Peter's daughter Elizabeth. He had 11 children, most of whom became members of the Russian nobility; he was a great-grandfather of the author and poet Alexander Pushkin."
"The main reliable accounts of Gannibal's life come from ""The Moor of Peter the Great,"" Pushkin's unfinished biography of his great-grandfather, published after Pushkin's death in 1837. Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author’s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel, ""The Blackamoor of Peter the Great"" based on his great-grandfather. A historical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law, Rotkirkh, was largely responsible for the myth, propagated by some historians, that Gannibal was born in Ethiopia. However, more recent research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes has established that the general was instead likely born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in present-day Cameroon."
"Richard Pankhurst, the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor ""prince"" or chief whose capital was Logon (now part of present-day Cameroon). His father was relatively affluent taking several wives and having 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the Ottoman Turks, Abram was abducted and taken to Constantinople by ship. His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother."
"Abram stayed in the Ottoman Empire for about a year in the service of Sultan Ahmed III's household. At the time, the Russian ambassador Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, representing Peter the Great, was looking for ""a few clever little African slaves"" for the Tsar's palace in Moscow, as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, great-grandfather of the celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a bribe. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great."
"The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy’s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household."
"Abram was baptized in 1705, in St. Paraskeva Church in Vilnius, with Peter as his godfather. The date of Gannibal’s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth."
"Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter (Elizabeth), and was loyal to them as if they were family."
"Starting at a young age, the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather’s valet."
"In 1717, Abram was sent to Metz to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in mathematics and geometry. In 1718 Abram joined the French Army with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in military engineering. He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at La Fère in 1720."
"During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between France and Spain, and he fought for France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz."
"It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname ""Gannibal"" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (""Gannibal"" being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian). In Paris he met and befriended such Enlightenment figures as the Baron de Montesquieu and Voltaire (this claim by his biographer Hugh Barnes is disputed by reviewer Andrew Kahn). Voltaire called Gannibal the ""dark star of the Enlightenment""."
"Gannibal returned to Russia the following year, and his advanced training enabled him to apply and successfully acquire posts first as an engineer and then as a mathematics tutor for one of the Tsar's private guard units."
"Gannibal's education was completed by 1723, and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, Prince Menshikov gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education. Gannibal was exiled to Siberia in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of Saint Petersburg. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer."
"Elizabeth of Russia became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by ""A. Ganibal"" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the Mikhailovskoye estate in Pskov Oblast with hundreds of serfs. He retired to this estate in 1762."
"In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of nobility and a coat of arms, he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word ""FVMMO"", which may mean ""homeland"" in the Kotoko language. In his book, ""Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg"", Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of ""The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian"", met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression ""Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino"" which means ""Fortune has changed my life entirely."""
"Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a Greek woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was forced to marry. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile, and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage. Gannibal’s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years."
"Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her bigamously in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal’s second marriage to Christina was much happier, and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him."
"On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife was descended from noble families in Scandinavia and Germany: Siöberg (Sweden), Galtung (Norway), and Grabow (Denmark) / von Grabow (Brandenburg). Her paternal grandfather was Gustaf Siöberg, Rittmester til Estrup, who died in 1694, whose wife Clara Maria Lauritzdatter Galtung (ca. 1651–1698) was the daughter of Lauritz Lauritzson Galtung (ca. 1615–1661) and of Barbara Grabow til Pederstrup (1631–1696)."
"Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of Alexander Pushkin. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who helped found the city of Kherson in 1779 and attained the rank of general-in-chief, the second-highest military rank in imperial Russia."
"Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and her sister, Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn. George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, is also a direct descendant, as the grandson of Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven."
"Gannibal's actual place of birth continues to be uncertain, and is subject to speculation by modern historians. Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in Ethiopia. Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of Medri Bahri, an ancient kingdom in present-day Eritrea. In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of ""Logon"" or ""Lagone"". Anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that ""Lagone"" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea. In 1999, the Russian Institute in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a commemorative stamp to honor Pushkin's bicentennial."
"The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a bust of him near the African Union headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from Moscow to Addis Ababa in 2014. However, the notion that Gannibal may have been born in Ethiopia holds little currency with the general Ethiopian population. The Eritrean government asserts that Gannibal was instead born in Loggo Sarda, an area in modern Eritrea. It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009."
"Vladimir Nabokov cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel ""Eugene Onegin"". Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to ""the Lagona region of equatorial Africa, south of Lake Chad."" Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that ""hamitic"" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than ""negroid"" origins."
"The Beninean historian Dieudonné Gnammankou, an expert on Russia, studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from Logone-Birni and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the ""Logon"" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old Kotoko kingdom of Logone-Birni, now located in northern Cameroon. He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than Gondar, Ethiopia. Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair."
"Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for ""homeland"" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa."
"In November, 2010, representatives from Russia and Estonia, the ambassador of Cameroon, and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to La Fère, France to unveil a commemorative plaque honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La Fère's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by King Louis XV shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La Fère, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonné Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La Fère taking place, also served as the main speaker at a symposium following the event."

"= = = Kingston, California = = ="
"Kingston is a former town that is no longer in existence. Originally in Fresno County, until 1909 when Fresno County lands in the vicinity, south of Kings river were transferred to Kings County, California. It was located on the south bank of the Kings River northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry."
"L. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called ""El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles"" (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river. Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858. A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis. Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston."
"Oliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859. Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872. In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year."
"On December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away. Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned. Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930."
"The site of the town is now a California Historical Landmark (#270), which can be found in Kingston-Laton County Park in Kings County."
= = = Voluntary euthanasia = = =
Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary euthanasia (VE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.
"Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada."
"Voluntary refusal of food and fluids (VRFF) (also called voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, or VSED) or Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia, while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option. VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia."
"Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with ""active euthanasia"" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important. For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited."
"The term euthanasia comes from the Greek words ""eu""-meaning good and ""thanatos""-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or ""dying well"". Hippocrates mentions euthanasia in the Hippocratic Oath, which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.” Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, where a person no longer cared for his life."
"English Common Law from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, Thomas More, considered a saint by Roman Catholics, described a utopian community and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of ""torturing and lingering pain"", see The meaning of the work."
"Since the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years. After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors. Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s."
"In an article in the ""Bulletin of the History of Medicine"", Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. Appel indicates social activist Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, was the driving force behind this movement. According to historian Ian Dowbiggin, leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, advocated for the legalization of euthanasia."
"In 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain. During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as ""mercy killings,"" such as by parents of their severely disabled children."
"During the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included Glanville Williams (""The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law"") and clergyman Joseph Fletcher (""Morals and medicine""). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased."
"In 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996, was passed in the Northern Territory of Australia. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a device designed by Dr Philip Nitschke. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997. In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded EXIT International. In 2009, an Australian quadriplegic was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die. The Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes. Chief Justice Wayne Martin also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions. Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection."
"On 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that ""the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient"" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia ""in the shortest time possible""."
"On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death."
"In 1957 in Britain, Judge Devlin ruled in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide, and in 2002, restrictions were loosened. During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in Belgium. Belgium's at the time most famous author Hugo Claus, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an Antwerp doctor."
"A key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit."
"In 1980 the Hemlock Society USA was founded in Santa Monica by Derek Humphry. It was the first group in the United States to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death. Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law. In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices."
"In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992. Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television. Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia."
"In 1994, Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act, permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997. The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case ""Gonzales v. Oregon""."
"In 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, Terri Schiavo, a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no living will and the rest of her family claimed otherwise."
"In November 2008, Washington Initiative 1000 made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide."

"The first intercollegiate athletic event in the school's history took place on November 25, 1892, when the Agriculturalists defeated the football team from the University of Utah, 12-0. The football program has a rich history (Merlin Olsen and Phil Olsen are alumni) throughout the mid-20th century, but has struggled lately, following two ill-fated stints as an independent program and two more years in the geographically distant Sun Belt Conference, after the Big West Conference, which had housed the Aggies since 1978, elected to stop sponsoring football in 2001. USU's other teams remained in that conference until the school was invited to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2005. USU had lobbied to join its in-state rivals Utah and BYU in the WAC for many decades prior to 2005, but were only allowed in after the two other schools had left to form the Mountain West Conference. Subsequently both Utah and BYU departed the Mountain West Conference and USU was invited to join that conference, where they currently reside."
"Recently, the men's basketball team, under coach Stew Morrill, has become a nationally respected program, with several conference championships and trips to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The basketball program has been one of the most successful programs in the country since 2000, winning at least 23 games in each season, many conference championships, and appearing in the NCAA tournament numerous times. In fact, many Aggie sports have been extremely successful for many years, though this is often overlooked due to the recent futility of the football team."
"Following the great heights of the 1960s and 70's, Aggie football has fallen upon hard times in recent decades, leading to a disproportionate lack of USU sports coverage in statewide and national media. Many of the Aggie faithful attribute the decline to administrators at both Utah and BYU freezing then-superior USU out of the newly formed WAC. However, other factors cited as leading to the decline include a failure to upgrade facilities until recently, a lack of donors to athletics, and the complacency of past athletics directors. The futility of the football program has had an extremely negative effect on the perception of the university as a whole, and it is something that the Aggies are only now recovering from. 2011 saw the first winning season in many years, a bowl game, and in May 2012, an invitation to the Mountain West Conference, which will give USU its first stable, promising conference home in a half-century."
"However, former athletic director Scott Barnes recently inked deals with TV stations, replaced the head football coach, raised funds, and accomplished numerous necessary reorganizations, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and conference schools. In large part due to his efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses. The Aggies brought in WAC championships in five sports during the 2008–09 academic year, tied for the most in school history."
"As of January 2016, Aggie football has an overall record of 547–533–31 (.506)"
"After many years of futility, the Aggies experienced a renaissance under head coach Gary Andersen, who replaced Brent Guy following the 2008 season. The 2011 campaign was the team's first winning season in many years, resulting in a postseason bowl berth. 2012 has brought the school's first-ever 10-win season and WAC championship (its first outright conference championship since 1936), and national Top 25 rankings in all three major polls. Andersen left USU after the 2012 season and has been replaced by his former offensive coordinator Matt Wells."
"The Aggies have played in eight bowl games in their history, winning three. The team's first victory came in the 1993 Las Vegas Bowl against . The team has made three consecutive bowl appearances, the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, in 2011 and 2012, and the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, in 2013. The team lost to Ohio in the 2011 edition and defeated Toledo 41–15 in the 2012 edition. In 2013 USU defeated Northern Illinois University in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl."
"USU football is played at Maverik Stadium, which seats 25,100."
"The men's cross country team has been impressive in recent years, winning the WAC title for the past five years in a row—each year since joining the WAC. Members of the team have garnered numerous conference and regional awards, and have competed in the NCAA Championships. Likewise, the men's track and field team has long enjoyed success, with a bevy of All-American athletes from decades past. In recent years, the team has also won WAC championships in 2007, 2009, and 2010 (outdoor) and 2008 and 2010 (indoor)."
"Golf has spent many years attempting to return to the heights achieved in the early 1980s by alum Jay Don Blake. As a member of the Aggie golf squad, Blake won the NCAA Championship in 1980 and was named NCAA Player of the Year in 1981. He turned pro that year, and in 1987 joined the PGA Tour, where he has one victory and several top-10 finishes, mostly in the early '90s. He has won three times on the Champions Tour."
"The tennis team has a difficult time attracting major recruits due to the lack of indoor on-campus facilities. The team trains and plays its home matches at an upscale local gym. Despite this deficiency, the team has produced a number of athletes who have won all-conference honors in recent years, drawing from both local and international talent pools."
"Of women's sports at USU, gymnastics has probably been most successful historically, heading to the postseason 26 times, including five trips to the national championships. The soccer team has been successful as of late, finishing the 2008 season with a perfect record in conference play, as well as a WAC title. Despite falling in the conference tournament in 2009, Aggie soccer landed three players on the All-WAC first team."
"Women's volleyball and softball are two of the sports at USU that boast of national championships in their history. In 1978 the Aggie volleyball team defeated UCLA to win the AIAW Large College volleyball national championship. The following year, the team fell to Hawaii in the championship match."
"The Aggie softball team has appeared in four Women's College World Series, in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1984, winning the AIAW Division I softball national championship in 1980 and 1981."
"Neither team has returned to such heights in recent years, though each has been consistently good. The women's tennis team struggles with the same disadvantages as the men's."
"The women's basketball program began rebuilding in 2003 after a 16-year absence. At the time, USU was the only Division I school that did not have a women's basketball program besides the mostly male Virginia Military Institute and The Citadel. It took eight years for Utah State to post a winning record, finishing the 2010–11 season at 16–15 after reaching the second round of the WNIT. The 2011–12 team finished 21–10 for the first 20-win season in school history, exiting the WNIT in the first round. Following the season, Raegan Pebley, who had been head coach since the return of the sport, was hired away by Fresno State, with Jerry Finkbeiner being hired as her replacement."
"The most used sports venue is the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics events are held. TV and radio announcers visiting the Smith Spectrum for the first time commonly state that the spectrum is one of the loudest basketball venues in the country with one of the most enthusiastic crowds in the country, rivaling Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University. It is a tradition that near the beginning of games the crowd chooses one player from the other team who commits a blatant foul, taunts the crowd, etc., and every time that player touches the ball the entire crowd boos loudly until he passes the ball. This pressure on opposing players created by this tradition has cut many outstanding players down to below average while at the Spectrum."
"The football team plays in Maverik Stadium, slightly north and west of the main campus. The stadium had natural grass until 2004, when artificial turf was installed. Romney Stadium is built on a hillside, and appears much smaller from outside than it actually is, as much of the seating and the field are below street level. In 2009, the field at Romney Stadium was named Merlin Olsen Field, in honor of the Hall of Fame alumnus."
"The name Aggies, short for Agriculturalists, is a fixture of many universities that began as land-grant and agricultural colleges. Early USU sports teams were sometimes simply referred to as the ""Farmers"" as well as the Aggies, though the former name was never official. Beginning in the 1930s, an image of a ""bean-pole farmer"" with a pitchfork in hand and hay stalk in mouth began to be used to represent the college, though this too was never made official, and disappeared following the transformation into a full-fledged university in 1957."
"During the late 1960s and early '70s, a movement began on campus to shed the Aggie name in favor of the Utah State Highlanders, but the movement met with widespread opposition and was abandoned. The name ""Highlanders"" was a nod to the university's historic ideological tie to Scotland, which came about very early on in the college's history, mostly due to the university's setting on a hill in a high mountain valley. In fact, for a brief period, USU's teams were indeed nicknamed the ""Scotsmen"" as well, and a remnant of this era lives on in the current and popular fight song ""The Scotsman""."
"A November 7, 1901 meeting decided that the college's official color would be blue. It originated as more of a royal blue, morphing fully into navy by the 1920s. The term ""Big Blue"" came about in the 1960s simply to refer to the uniform color, as opposed to any particular mascot. The image of a bull first appeared on a football game program in 1975, and the following year it was adopted as USU's mascot."
"For a few years, USU used an actual white bull, painted blue, which was brought to sporting events and corralled on the sidelines. However, when the Smith Spectrum was built, there were concerns with the bull ruining the floor. For a short time, the bull was outfitted with red rubber boots, which did not pan out and the bull was retired."
"In 1987 USU Student Athletics Vice President John Mortensen decided that Utah State should still have a mascot and spent $750 on a costume for Big Blue. The costume was somewhat of a disappointment because it was royal blue, not navy, had real animal horns, and was not easy to move around in."
"The costume has since undergone at least one redesign, but is now one of the most active and recognized college mascots in the region. Possibly Big Blue's most well-known antic was his tradition of rappelling from the JumboTron to kick off team introductions for men's basketball games. He also enjoys crowdsurfing. As of 2003, four of the six people who had played the Big Blue role had gone on to become mascots for professional sports teams."
"The HURD is the student section at Utah State University. The HURD started in 2006 and has grown every year since. Beginning as a club in the USU Student Association, the HURD moved to total inclusion of the entire USU student body in the summer of 2012. At capacity, the HURD fills 6,500 seats at Romney Stadium for USU Football and 4,000 seats in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum for USU Basketball. The HURD helps organize major activities, with leadership and help from the HURD Committee, such as tailgates, camp outs, away game watch parties and more for the student body and community. Drawing from its motto ""Be Seen. Be Loud. Be HURD!"", the HURD ensures that the teams who visit Utah State University will experience the best atmosphere in the country for collegiate athletics by being known as one of the craziest student sections in the country."
"The Aggies' principal fight song is known as ""Hail the Utah Aggies"" as well as simply ""Fight Song"". It was composed in 1933 by Mickey Hart, with words by Darwin Jepsen and Mark Hart. The main verse is sung twice, with the chant once in between."
"The popular Scotsman song was composed by student Ebenezer J. Kirkham, class of 1918. At athletic events, ""The Scotsman"" is often sung immediately following ""Hail the Utah Aggies"". The words are sung twice through without a break, accompanied by synchronized arm gestures originally created by a small students in Section K of the Spectrum in the early 90s to represent milking of a cow by hand eventually spread to the entire student section. The motions are yet another example of USU students ingenuity creating longstanding traditions at sporting events. During the final words of the second ""verse"", the students' pitch often rises to a full-out yell."

"The Rule in Dumpor's Case is a common law rule of property law first set forth by Sir Edward Coke in 1578 (4 Coke 1196 [1578]). In its most basic form, it states that once a landlord has consented to an assignment of a tenant's interest in a leasehold estate, he implicitly consents to all future assignments by the tenant."
"This rule is still operative in some U.S. states and some other jurisdictions which follow English common law, but the parties may contract around the rule by putting a clause in the lease agreement which allows the landlord to reserve his right to approve or disapprove an assignment."

= = = Hypoblast = = =
The hypoblast is a tissue type that forms from the inner cell mass. It lies beneath the epiblast and consists of small cuboidal cells.
"Extraembryonic endoderm (including Yolk sac) is derived from hypoblast cells. The absence of hypoblast results in multiple primitive streaks in chicken embryos. The formation of the primitive streak, through which gastrulation occurs, is induced by Koller's sickle."
"In mouse embryo, the visceral endoderm develop from the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst during the implantation stage covering the epiblast cells and elongates to become an egg cylinder. A distinct morphological domain has been identified by Martin and colleagues, at the distal tip of the mouse egg cylinder, thus this domain was called distal visceral domain (DVE). The DVE cells will move unilaterally to the future anterior until reaching the embryonic/ extra embryonic boundary and at this point, the DVE cells are also named as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). This migration has been proved to be essential for establishing anteroposterior axis. Besides the AVE, another cell population appears to be separated at the posterior edge of the embryonic egg cylinder, referred to as posterior visceral endoderm (PVE). However, the function of this cell population was not as well studied as AVE."
"Although the hypoblast does not contribute to the embryo, it has great influences on the orientation of the embryonic axis. For example, the AVE in hypoblast plays an important role in positioning the primitive streak at the midland of the amniote embryos. In chick, people had observed that removal of the hypoblast caused multiple, ectopic primitive streaks formation. Similarly, in mice embryo, the AVE expresses secreted molecules, including two antagonists of nodal signaling, Cerberus-like (Cerl) and a TGFβ superfamily molecule, Lefty1. It was shown that Cerberus−/−;Lefty1−/− compound mutants mice developed a primitive streak ectopically in the embryo. There is also finding suggested that the hypoblast also inhibit primitive streak formation by depositing extracellular matrix components to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides the role of positioning the site of gastrulation, AVE also showed other function including continued protection against caudalization of the early nervous system. Also primitive endoderm derived yolk sac has major function in guaranteeing the proper organogenesis of the fetus and efficient exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes."
"In mammals, the existence of primitive endoderm had been observed as early as the end of the 19th century as first recognized by Duval and Sobotta. However, it took long time before people realized that the primitive endoderm will be replaced by definitive endoderm which will further develop into the gut tube. The first convincing experiment was conducted by Bellairs in chick embryo with the careful observation under electron and light microscopy. In his experiment, Bellairs demonstrated that there is a transitory endoderm cell layer in the chick embryo at its ventral surface before the formation of primitive streak. This layer of cell was replaced by definitive endoderm migration from the primitive streak through ingression and de-epithelialization. Later on, more insights on primitive endoderm and definitive endoderm origin and formation have been provided in different species including rat and mouse, rhesus monkey, baboon et al."

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as the Fight of the Century or the Battle for Greatness, was a professional boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110. Although the fight was considered to be one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a letdown by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast."
"Despite predictions that Mayweather–Pacquiao would be the highest-grossing fight in history as early as 2009, disagreements between the two professional boxers' camps on terms for the fight prevented the bout from coming to fruition until 2015. The failure to arrange the Mayweather–Pacquiao fight was named the 2010 ""Event of the Year"" by ""The Ring"". Serious negotiations were kickstarted in 2014 by an unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter and part-time actor, Gabriel Salvador, made a key introduction between Pacquiao's trainer and confidant Freddie Roach and CBS President Les Moonves, who both worked to facilitate the match. By 2015, negotiations for the fight had been finalized, with all of the major issues that prevented the fight from happening in the past resolved, including purse split, drug testing and location."
"The fight was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) jointly produced by HBO and Showtime, the respective rightsholders of Pacquiao and Mayweather. In the Philippines, the fight was also broadcast in simulcast across three of the country's major broadcast television networks. The fight was expected to be the most lucrative in the history of professional boxing: with an initial estimate of 4.4 million purchases, the PPV alone broke revenue records in the United States (U.S.) with $410 million in revenue, making it the highest-grossing PPV in history, surpassing Mayweather–Álvarez in 2013. By September 2015, the figure had been amended to 4.6 million. The broadcast of the fight in the Philippines was watched by nearly half the country's households. Due to the record high price of the PPV, the fight was also widely broadcast through unauthorized online streams on services such as Periscope."
"Despite the large amount of hype that surrounded it, critics felt that the bout itself was disappointing, primarily citing Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy in the ring and Pacquiao's difficulty in landing punches on Mayweather. This had led to some critics re-labelling the fight 'Better Never Than Late' rather than 'Fight of the Century'. It was later revealed following the event that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the fourth round. Further controversy emerged when it was revealed that prior to the fight, Mayweather had been administered IV fluids cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through a retroactive ""therapeutic use exemption""—an exemption, however, not authorized by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC)."
"When the fight was announced, Mayweather was 38 years old and still undefeated, with a perfect professional record of 47 wins and no losses. On June 6, 2008, six months after defeating Ricky Hatton by a tenth-round technical knockout, Mayweather announced his retirement from boxing. At the time, plans were in motion for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, which was going to take place September 20, 2008. ""This decision was not an easy one for me to make as boxing is all I have done since I was a child,"" Mayweather said. ""However, these past few years have been extremely difficult for me to find the desire and joy to continue in the sport."" At the time, 31-year-old Mayweather registered 39 wins and no losses in his historic career. At the time of his retirement, ""The Ring"" had Mayweather ranked as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Manny Pacquiao at No. 2."
"During Mayweather's brief retirement, Pacquiao earned superstar status in much of the Western world with his eighth-round technical knockout victory over Oscar De La Hoya, for which he moved up from lightweight to welterweight (135 pounds to 147 pounds)."
"On May 2, 2009, the day of Pacquiao's fight against Ricky Hatton, Mayweather announced that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, ""The Ring"" lightweight champion and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Márquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a 12-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a 12-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: ""If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause guess what? I beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round. ... When you talk boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather."""
"Pacquiao would go on to defeat Hatton by a second-round knockout to win ""The Ring"" junior welterweight title. The win made him the second boxer in history to win titles in six weight divisions, the first being Oscar De La Hoya."
"Mayweather vs. Márquez was postponed until September 19, 2009, due to a rib injury suffered by Mayweather. Despite being out of the ring for 21 months, Mayweather looked as sharp as ever and dominated the fight, winning by a lopsided 12-round unanimous decision. After the bout, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe stated that a fight with Pacquiao was the ""next obvious choice from a marketing standpoint."""
"On November 14, 2009, Pacquiao stopped Puerto Rican star Miguel Cotto in round 12 to win the WBO welterweight title. Pacquiao's victory sparked a media frenzy and fans were quick to demand a fight between the two of them, despite the fact that the actual fight itself had not officially been made yet and would not take place until 2015."
"On December 5, 2009, ESPN reported that Pacquiao signed a contract to fight Mayweather on March 13, 2010. Shortly afterward, Pacquiao denied ever signing a contract to fight Mayweather, telling ""FanHouse"", ""There are still some things that need to be negotiated."" On December 11,"
"Golden Boy Promotions sent an eight-page contract to Top Rank, proposing a 50–50 financial split for a fight to take place on March 13, 2010. The contract was very detailed, including such matters as who would weigh-in first (Pacquiao), who would enter the ring first (Pacquiao) and who would be introduced first (Mayweather). The contract included an HBO PPV showing at a cost of $59.95. Billing was to be ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, presented by Top Rank, Golden Boy Promotions, Mayweather Promotions and M-P Promotions in association with [approved sponsors and the site]."" Also included in the contract was Olympic-style drug testing. Venues for the fight being discussed were Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and the Superdome in New Orleans."
"In a video titled ""Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao"" uploaded to YouTube on December 11, 2009, Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, revealed the first hint about Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing, telling roving reporter Elie Seckbach, ""I hear negotiations are a little shady. (Richard) Schaefer and them are unhappy about something. They want Olympic-style drug testing. I said, 'Yeah, no problem.' I said, 'Whatever you want.' Since we accepted that, now they're running scared again."""
"On December 13, 2009, Pacquiao's adviser, Michael Koncz, said Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing was a laughing matter and they had no concerns whatsoever about it. ""Our reaction is, 'So what?' We know Manny doesn't take any illegal drugs or anything. And none of this is getting under Manny's skin or anything. I'm here with Manny, and to him, it's like a joke. It's a laughing matter,"" said Koncz."
"After reports had surfaced that both parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling to comply with the Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent. ""We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight,"" Arum told David Mayo of the ""Grand Rapids Press""."
"Not long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to three tests: one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and immediately after the fight. ""Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested ... It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures ... The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous,"" Arum explained. Freddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the ""Los Angeles Times"" on December 22, 2009, that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before."
"On December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's ""Pacquiao–Hatton: 24/7"" surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao filed suit in U.S. District Court in Nevada on December 30, 2009, against Floyd Mayweather Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr., Roger Mayweather, Mayweather Promotions and Golden Boy Promotions executives Oscar De La Hoya and Richard Schaefer, alleging that they made false and defamatory statements accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs."
"Both sides agreed to enter into mediation on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected."
"Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The ""Grand Rapids Press"", Mayweather said, ""I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is."""
"After the failed negotiations, both boxers moved on to other fights. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated Joshua Clottey via unanimous decision and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision."
"On May 13, 2010, Bob Arum announced that he had penciled in November 13, 2010, as the date of Pacquiao's next fight, possibly against Mayweather. Pacquiao was quoted by the ""Manila Bulletin"" on May 20, as saying, ""As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight."" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking off the rest of 2010 and possibly 2011."
"Arum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. ""That's all been resolved,"" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of ""Yahoo Sports"" regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the ""Las Vegas Review-Journal"", ""There's no longer any issues...The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year."" He would reiterate that comment to the ""Manila Bulletin"", stating, ""It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight."""
"Offit grew up in Baltimore, the son of a shirtmaker. He went to his father's sales meetings and reacted negatively to the tall tales told by salespeople, instead preferring the clean and straightforward practice of science. When he was five years old, he was sent to a polio ward to recover from clubfoot surgery; this experience caused him to see children as vulnerable and helpless, and motivated him through the 25 years of the development of the rotavirus vaccine."
"Offit decided to become a doctor, the first in his family. Offit earned his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his M.D. from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. One of his mentors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was Maurice Hilleman, who developed several of the major vaccines in use today."
"By 2008 Offit had become a leading advocate of childhood immunizations. He was opposed by vaccine critics, many of whom believe vaccines cause autism, a belief that has been rejected by major medical journals and professional societies. He received a death threat and received protection by an armed guard during meetings at the CDC. His 2008 book ""Autism's False Prophets"" catalyzed a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the U.S. He donated the royalties from the book to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit serves on the board of the American Council on Science and Health. In 2015, Dr. Offit appeared in a vaccine awareness video created by Robert Till in which he advocated for teenage vaccinations."
"Offit worked for 25 years on the development of a safe and effective vaccine against rotavirus, which is a cause of diarrhea, and which kills almost 600,000 children a year worldwide, about half as many as malaria kills; most deaths are outside the West. His interest in the disease stemmed from the death of a 9-month-old infant from rotavirus-caused dehydration while under his care as a pediatric resident in 1979."
"Along with his colleagues Fred Clark and Stanley Plotkin, Offit invented RotaTeq, a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Since 2006, RotaTeq has been one of two vaccines currently used against rotavirus."
"In February 2006, RotaTeq was approved for inclusion in the recommended U.S. vaccination schedule, following its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Premarketing studies found that RotaTeq was effective and safe, with an incidence of adverse events comparable to placebo. RotaTeq has been credited (by Peter Hotez) with saving hundreds of lives a day. Offit received an unspecified sum of money for his interest in RotaTeq. Offit was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in 2015."
"In 2002, during a period of fears about bioterrorism, Offit was the only member of the CDC's advisory panel to vote against a program to give smallpox vaccine to tens of thousands of Americans. He later argued on ""60 Minutes II"" and ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" that the risk of harm for people getting the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting smallpox in the U.S. at the time."
"In December 2013, Sarah Erush and Offit declared the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a moratorium on the use of dietary supplements without certain manufacturers' guarantee for quality."
"Offit defines alternative medicine as quackery when it involves unappreciated harm and replacement of conventional therapies that work, with alternative therapies that don't. His books and articles warn against expense and risk to health for recipients of alternative therapies. In 2013 Offit wrote the book ""Do you believe in Magic? – The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine."" Offit states that the purpose of the book ""is to take a critical look at the field of Alternative Medicine – to separate fact from myth."" and that ""There's only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't.""(p. 6) One of Offit's concerns is the scare tactics he says proponents of Alternative Medicine will often use, in a 2010 podcast with the ""Point of Inquiry"" Offit stated ""it is very difficult to unscare people when you scare them."""
Offit has said that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 should be overturned to provide proper oversight and action against supplement providers.
Offit has blamed Rachel Carson for millions of deaths from malaria because of her campaign against DDT.
"Offit is a recipient of numerous awards, including the J. Edmund Bradley Prize for Excellence in Pediatrics from the University of Maryland Medical School, the Young Investigator Award in Vaccine Development from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the 2013 Maxwell Finland Award for Scientific Achievement and a Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health. In 2018, Offit was awarded the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, DC for his work on the oral rotavirus vaccine and his leadership in promoting immunization."
"In 2011 Offit was honored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization with the 2011 Biotech Humanitarian Award. Offit donated the award’s $10,000 prize to the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Also in 2011, Offit was elected to the Institute of Medicine at the group's annual meeting. In 2013 Offit was presented with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) for ""Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine"". ""Offit is a literal lifesaver... educates the public about the dangers of alternative medicine, may save many, many more."""
"Michael Specter wrote that Offit ""has become a figure of hatred to the many vaccine denialists and conspiracy theorists."" Specter reported that Offit had often been threatened with violence by anti-vaccine advocates, necessitating precautions such as screening Offit's packages for mail bombs and providing guards when Offit attends federal health advisory committee meetings. At a 2008 vaccine activism rally in Washington, D.C., environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. criticized Offit's ties to drug companies, calling him a ""poster child for the term 'biostitute'."""
"Also in 2008, Sharyl Attkisson published an article for CBS News questioning Offit's independence, citing his financial ties to vaccine manufacturers. Offit said he is upfront about the money and that it doesn't affect his decisions. Curt Linderman Sr., the editor of the Autism File blog, wrote online that it would ""be nice"" if Offit ""was dead""."
"Such criticism has provoked statements in Offit's defense. Peter Hotez, a professor and vaccine researcher at George Washington University, has been quoted in a ""Newsweek"" article:"
"Offit has written or co-written several books on vaccines, vaccination and the public, and antibiotics, as well as dozens of scholarly articles on the topic. Isabelle Rapin, a neurology professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, wrote in ""Neurology Today"" about ""Autism's False Prophets"":"
"In ""The Cutter Incident"" (""see"" Cutter Laboratories incident), Offit describes fallout relating to an early poliovirus vaccine tragedy that had the effect of deterring production of already licensed vaccines and discouraging the development of new ones. Offit advocates for the repeal of religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, saying that such exemptions amount to medical neglect."

"Randall v. Orange County Council, 17 Cal.4th 736, 952 P.2d 261, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 453 (1998), was a case before the Supreme Court of California that established that groups such as the Boy Scouts of America are not considered ""business establishments"" as used in the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act and could not be subject to its provisions. Its companion case was ""Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America"", 17 Cal.4th 670, 952 P.2d 218, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (1998)."
"Twin brothers Michael and William Randall were Cub Scouts, a membership division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), in Anaheim Hills with Den 4, Pack 519 of the Orange County Council. They were on their way to earning the Bear Badge which included, in one of its four advancement areas, a religious component that asserted the existence of God and required the practice of one's faith as ""taught in your home, church, synagogue, mosque, or religious fellowship,"" as well as a pledge asserting their duty to God which was included in the opinion of the court:"
"We are lucky the people who wrote and signed our constitution were very wise. They understood the need of Americans to worship God as they choose. A member of your family will be able to talk with you about your duty to God. Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. ""I, ____, promise to do my best to do my duty to God and my country."""
"The Randalls stated at their local Cub Scout den meeting that they had a conflict with the religious requirement. The den leader asserted to the children's mother that the requirement was necessary to proceed through the ranks. The Orange County Council agreed with this position. While initially the Orange County Council allowed the Randalls to continue to participate in Scouting activities, it refused to allow them to advance in the ranks until they asserted their duty to God."
"The mother, as guardian ad litem, filed suit against the Orange County Council, alleging that the Council reversed its initial decision and expelled the Randalls from the Boy Scouts."
"The Superior Court for the County of Orange ruled at the initial trial that the BSA was considered a ""business establishment"" under the terms of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act because of the preponderance of the defendants evidence that illustrated the BSA's extensive real estate holdings, revenue-generating interests, and commercial enterprises. The court ordered statutory damages of $250 awarded to the plaintiffs and a ""permanent injunction against [the BSA], preventing it from excluding [the Randalls] from membership or advancement in the organization or in a den, pack, troop, or post based upon [the BSA's] religious beliefs or lack thereof, their refusal to swear an oath or a duty to God, or to use the word ""God"" in any pledge, oath, or promise or vow, or their failure to participate in any religious activities."""
"The BSA appealed the decision to the California Court of Appeal which upheld the core of the decision (that the BSA was subject to the Unruh Civil Rights Act) based on the court's earlier decision in ""Curran"", 147 Cal.App.3d 712 (1986), but reversed the injunction. The Supreme Court of California granted review."
"In a 7-0 ruling, the Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower court based on their decision in ""Curran"", 17 Cal. 4th 670, that the BSA did not qualify under the Unruh Civil Rights Act as the court found it to be a ""charitable organization"" with interests unrelated to the economic benefit of its members, and that it did not have a commercial interest in the activities provided to its members."
"As a sidebar, the Randalls reached the rank of Eagle Scout before being expelled from the BSA as a result of court prohibiting further actions by the BSA regarding their expulsion until the case was resolved."

""Rotestein"" means ""red rock"", the name being derived from the colour of the diabase material of which it is composed. Before the reservoir was created, these rocks dominated the old route between Hasselfelde and Rübeland where it crossed the Rappbode on a stone bridge that is now drowned by the reservoir.

= = = Armand Mattelart = = =
"Armand Mattelart (born January 8, 1936) is a Belgian sociologist and well known as a Leftist French scholar. His work deals with media, culture and communication, specially in their historical and international dimensions."
"After finishing his undergraduate studies Mattelart joined a community of secular monks in Brittany for one year, but went on to study Law and Political Science at the Catholic University of Louvain. Afterwards he studied demography at the Institute of Demographic Studies in Paris (founded by the influential left intellectual Alfred Sauvy, who in 1952 coined the term Third World). Upon finishing his studies he was appointed as an expert on the politics of population by the Vatican, and in 1962 was sent to the Universidad Católica de Chile. While in Chile he married Michèle Mattelart."
"While in Chile Mattelart was appointed to confront from a catholic spiritual perspective the strategic models for family planning which were at the time being pushed by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Alianza para el Progreso (Alliance for Progress—a US official aid program). The US family planning model aimed to limit the natality to ""improve the lives of the inhabitants of the continent"" and of course in conflict with the Catholic teachings. The revolutionary transformations in Latin America post-1960 require that the Church enter the ideological fray and develop communication strategies applied to ""ideological, political and social struggles"" to create ideological and political alternatives to atheist communism or the ""protestant North American imperialism""."
"While always based at the Catholic Univ. of Chile, Mattelart underwent a transformation in his thoughts and beliefs. He initiated a collaboration with the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Nacional (CEREN) (Center for the Study of the National Reality), founded in 1968 under the auspices of the Catholic Univ. Jacques Chonchol was CEREN's director (also an important ideolog with MAPU—a left offshoot of the Christian Democrats which was also part of the Unidad Popular government). CEREN's first research conducted by Armando Mattelart, Michèle Mattelart, Mabel Paccini, et al., had to do with a structural left analysis of the liberal press, the ""celebrity"" publications, the pseudo-amorous magazines. Mattelart primarily studied El Mercurio, the principal liberal newspaper. This was the starting-point of his lifelong involvement with the history of communications."
"The Cuadernos de la Realidad Nacional (Notebooks of the National Reality), CEREN's publication, became the principal ideological generators and emitters during the social democratic government of Salvador Allende (1970–1973). The journal was similar to the French post-structuralist model, and it was primarily aimed to analyze the political economy of the mass media. Under this rubric, Mattelart and Ariel Dorfman published in 1971 the famous pamphlet: ""Para leer al Pato Donald, manual de descolonización antinorteamericana"" (""How to read ""Donald Duck"", a manual for American de-colonization""), where they provided a Marxist structural analysis of global forms of American consumer capitalism. The pamphlet denounces ""Yankee media penetration"" through an assessment of Disney as global ideological conveyor of American liberal - and increasingly neoliberal - values. The book analyzed the celebrated family of ducks and presented them as nasty agents of the North American cultural imperialism. This book enjoyed great publicity and it became one of the best-selling books in Latin America during the 1970s, largely because of American-centered interventions in Latin America and repeated efforts by American political, economic, and paramilitary assets to undermine the democratically elected government in Chile."
"After the Chilean coup of 1973, Mattelart returned to France where (at age 37) he had to restart his academic career—he became a visiting scholar at the University of Paris VIII Saint-Denis. He later became a full professor of Science of Information and Communication—a topic on which he later became a theoretician. In 1974, he worked on ""La Espiral"", a film justifying the Chilean route to socialism. Between 1983 and 1997 he has been Professor of Information and Communication Sciences at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, and in the postgraduate program at Paris III (Nouvelle Sorbonne) -Rennes 2. Between 1997-2004, he has been Professor at the Université of Paris VIII. Since September 2004, he is Professor Emeritus."

It was published in September 2007 in the United Kingdom by Picador and in October 2007 in the United States by W. W. Norton and Company. The book, a result of cycling 14,000 miles around France coupled with four years of research, is an in-depth examination of French national identity as seen through the diverse cultures and languages contained within the country."
"Writing for ""The Guardian"", historian Andrew Hussey described it as an ""elegant, entertaining and occasionally brilliant overview of France past and present"", noting that despite Robb's academic background in French literature, it is written in the style of an accomplished novelist, and lamented that the ""discovery"" of this element of French history was identified by an English writer, and was yet to be ""discovered"" by the French themselves. In the ""Boston Globe"", Richard Eder suggested that the time spent on the bicycle provided Robb with a fresh approach to telling the history of France, but the four years he spent in the library meant there was a ""conscientious pursuit"" of detail within the book, covering such a wide variety of topics such as road building, touring, postcards, seaside development, spas, cave exploration, marsh reclamation, and the mountaineering vogue, which weighed the book down and detracted from the core themes."
"On April 28, 2008, the book was awarded the £10,000 Ondaatje Prize by the Royal Society of Literature in London. It also won the 2007 Duff Cooper Prize, earning Robb £5,000."

Supporters of the canal included the Central Valley farmers and the Metropolitan Water District and urban developers in Los Angeles who are beneficiaries of the water. Supporters claimed it would eliminate the need to pull water directly through this sensitive region, reducing salinity intrusion and water quality problems during the dry season. The canal was included in the initial SWP planning, and the lack of the canal is among the principal reasons the SWP has never been able to deliver its full entitlement."
"Opponents to the canal believe the construction project would do extensive damage to the sensitive Delta ecosystem, farms and communities. Opponents also believe there will be long-term damage to the Delta ecosystem from fresh water being removed prior to flushing through the Delta and flowing more naturally to the San Francisco Bay."
"Governor Jerry Brown had supported a ballot initiative in the early 1980s and has stated his intention to finish this project during his current governorship. Supporters of the canal have a strong argument as water being drawn from the southern intakes create problems for wildlife and changes the natural flow in these areas which would be corrected by drawing water further north. Supporters also claim that the California levees are also vulnerable to earthquakes and directing water away from them protects the supply of water. Delta farmers, communities, and commercial salmon and bass fishermen are especially concerned about the canal. However, Delta scientists disagree. The new proposed canal would transport of water to Silicon Valley, southern California and the majority of it would be directed to the Central Valley, a location with political influence and interest in the canal being built."
"Since the 1980s, there has been interest in creating a large off-stream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley. Water ""skimmed"" off high winter flows in the Sacramento River would be pumped into a storage basin in the western side of the valley known as Sites Reservoir. The reservoir would hold about of water to be released into the Sacramento River during low-flow periods, boosting the water supply available for SWP entitlement holders and improving water quality in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. This project has previously arisen in several forms, including proposals for a Glenn Reservoir or the Glenn-Colusa Complex on nearby streams, which would also have been receiving reservoirs for water sent east through the Dos Rios Project's Grindstone Tunnel or other transfers from North Coast rivers."
"With its large storage capacity, Sites Reservoir would increase the production and flexibility of California's water management system, yielding of new water per year. This project is being seriously considered by the Department of Water Resources, as California's water system is expected to face serious shortfalls of per year by 2020. However, the project has been criticized for its high cost, and potential disruption of fish migration when large amounts of water are drawn from the Sacramento River during the wet season."
"The Los Banos Grandes reservoir was first proposed in 1983 and would have served a similar purpose to Sites. The reservoir would have been located along the California Aqueduct several miles south of San Luis Reservoir, and would have allowed for the storage of water during wet years when extra water could be pumped from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants would have been built between Los Banos Grandes and the existing Los Banos flood control reservoir, and between that reservoir and the aqueduct. The current status of Los Banos Grandes remains uncertain, as the DWR has been unable to appropriate funding since the 1990s."
"The existing SWP facilities are collectively known as Stage I. Stage II, which includes such works as the Peripheral Canal and Sites Reservoir, was to have been built beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s – but due to concerted opposition from Northern Californians, environmentalist groups and some economic interests, as well as the state's increasing debt, attempts to begin construction have all met with failure. Parties currently receiving SWP water are also opposed to its expansion, because water rates could be raised up to 300 percent to help pay for the cost. As a result, SWP capacity falls short by an average of each year; contractors only occasionally receive their full shares of water."
"The disparity of costs to the project's various constituents has been a frequent source of controversy. Although the overall average cost of SWP water is $147 per acre-foot ($119 per 1,000 m), agricultural users pay far less than their urban counterparts for SWP water. The Kern County Water Agency (the second largest SWP entitlement holder) pays around $45–50 per acre-foot ($36–41 per 1,000 m) of SWP water, which is mostly used for irrigation. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (the largest entitlement holder) pays $298 per acre-foot ($241 per 1,000 m). This basically means that cities are subsidizing the cost of farm water, even though the cities also provided primary funding for the construction of the SWP."
"In the early 1970s, the SWP system still had a lot of ""surplus"" – water supply developed through the construction of Oroville Dam, which was running unused to the Pacific Ocean because the water delivery infrastructure for Southern California had not yet been completed (and when it was, southern California was slow to use the water). The surplus water was given for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley instead. Because the water would only be a temporary supply, farmers were advised to use it for seasonal crops (such as alfalfa or hay) rather than permanent crops such as orchards. Nevertheless, many farmers used the water to develop new permanent crops, creating a dependency on SWP water that is technically part of Southern California's entitlement, This is now causing tensions as Southern California continues to increase its use of SWP water, decreasing the amount of surplus available to the system, especially in years of drought."
"In dry years, water pumped from the Delta creates a hazard to spring-run salmon. As the Banks Pumping Plant pulls water from the Sacramento River southward across the Delta, it disrupts the normal flow direction of east to west that salmon smolt follow to the Pacific Ocean. Populations of salmon and steelhead trout have reached critically low levels in the decades after SWP water withdrawals began. The fish migration issue has become hotly contested in recent years, with rising support for the construction of the Peripheral Canal, which would divert water around the Delta, restoring the natural flow direction."
Water use and environmental problems associated with the SWP led to the creation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program (CALFED) in 1994. The primary goals are to improve quality of SWP water while preventing further ecological damage in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.
"In January 2014, after the moderately dry year of 2012 and the record California drought of 2013, the Department of Water Resources announced that the SWP would be making zero deliveries that year, the first time in the project's history, due to dangerously low snowpack and reservoir levels. On April 18, 2014, the Department of Water Resources increased the SWP allocation back to five percent and that level remained until the initial allocation for 2015 was give on December 1, 2014."

= = = Bob Bass = = =
"Robert Eugene Bass (January 28, 1929 – August 17, 2018) was an American basketball coach and executive who worked in college basketball, the American Basketball Association (ABA), and the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
Bass graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University and has a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma.
"Bass' professional coaching career started with the ABA's Denver Rockets (now the Denver Nuggets) in 1967, which he coached for two years. He coached college basketball at Texas Tech for a season-and-a-half from 1969 to 1971. He coached The Floridians of the ABA for two years before the team folded at the end of the 1972 season. The next season, he coached the Memphis Tams; and, at the beginning of the 1974/75 season, Bass was hired by the ABA's San Antonio Spurs, which he coached for nearly two seasons, until the franchise moved into the NBA in 1976 as part of the ABA–NBA merger."
"At that point, Bass moved into the Spurs' front office, assuming the role of general manager. He would, over the years with the team, assume coaching duties on an interim basis as needed—in 1980, 1984, and 1992. He finished his coaching career with a 311-300 record. At the conclusion of the 1989/90 season, Bass won the NBA Executive of the Year Award. Bass would then take a general manager position with the Charlotte Hornets in 1995; in that capacity, he would win the award again in 1997. Bass retired in 2004 (by which time the Hornets had relocated to New Orleans."
"Bass served as the head basketball coach at Oklahoma Baptist for 15 years and was named the NAIA Coach of the Year in 1967. In 1966, his team won the NAIA national title."
Bass was hired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders replacing Gene Gibson. Bass cited a challenge to return to the college game and a distaste for the long pro season and its demands on his time away from family for accepting the position of head coach at Texas Tech.
"In his first season, the Red Raiders posted a 14–10 record under Bass and finished third in the Southwest Conference (SWC) regular season standings. The 1969–70 team posted the first winning season for the Red Raiders in four years."
"On January 15, 1971, Bass resigned to take the same position with The Floridians of the American Basketball Association after coaching the first 13 games of the 1970–71 Red Raiders season. The following day, Bass coach The Floridians to a 123–119 win over the Utah Stars in Miami. Former Red Raiders player and first-year assistant coach Gerald Myers was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season."
"Bass died in his San Antonio home on August 17, 2018. He was 89."
= = = Barindra Kumar Ghosh = = =
"Barindra Kumar Ghosh or Barindra Ghosh, or, popularly, Barin Ghosh (5 January 1880 – 18 April 1959) was an Indian revolutionary and journalist. He was one of the founding members of Jugantar, a revolutionary outfit in Bengal. Barindra Ghosh was a younger brother of Sri Aurobindo."
"Barindra Ghosh was born at Croydon, near London on 5 January 1880. His father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghosh, was a physician and district surgeon. His mother Swarnalata was the daughter of the Brahmo religious and social reformer, scholar Rajnarayan Basu. Revolutionary and a spiritualist in later life, Aurobindo Ghosh was Barindranath's third elder brother. His second elder brother, Manmohan Ghose, was a scholar of English literature, a poet and professor of English at Presidency College, Calcutta and at Dhaka University. He also had a elder sister named Sarojini Ghosh."
"Barindranath attended school in Deoghar, and after passing the entrance examination in 1901, joined Patna College. He received military training in Baroda. During this time, (late 19th century – early 20th century) Barin was influenced by Aurobindo and drawn towards the revolutionary movement."

= = = Fan print with two bugaku dancers = = =
"Fan print with two bugaku dancers is an ""ukiyo-e"" woodblock print dating to sometime between the mid 1820s and 1844 by celebrated Edo period artist Utagawa Kunisada, also known as Toyokuni III. This print is simultaneously an example of the ""uchiwa-e"" (fan print) and ""aizuri-e"" (monochromatic blue print) genres. It is part of the permanent collection of the Prince Takamado Gallery of Japan at the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada."
"""Uchiwa"" (団扇) are non-folding, flat, oval fans. They are still used today for cooling rice in the preparation of sushi, in dance performances, and as a cooling tool. Historically, ""uchiwa"" were a predominantly female accessory, men typically carrying folding fans known as ""ōgi"" (扇), ""suehiro"" (末広) or ""sensu"" (扇子). They are associated with summer, traditionally having been sold only during the summer months, and decorated with summer imagery. At least one modern critic argues that, due to their use by women during periods of heat, ""uchiwa"" ""can have suggestive connotations."""
"Like ""ōgi-e"" (扇絵) folding fan prints, ""uchiwa-e"" were traditionally made from ""washi"" rice paper mounted on a wooden frame. Images were printed on paper, then cut along the margins and pasted onto a skeletal bamboo frame. As a result of their frequent handling, few pristine mounted examples remain."
"Also known as ""aizome-e"" (藍染絵) and ""ai-e"" (藍絵), ""aizuri-e"" (藍摺絵) translates literally as ""blue printed picture,"" and describes prints that are produced entirely or predominantly in shades of blue. A counterpart to ostensibly red and pink ""benizuri-e"" (紅摺絵), ""aizuri-e"" were a late Edo period development. Perhaps due to the fact that single colour prints were cheaper to produce, the ""aizuri"" technique was particularly popular for ""uchiwa-e""."
"In the past, some art historians theorized that ""aizuri-e"" arose as a result of an 1841 government ban on the use of lavish colour in the then-dominant ""nishiki-e"" (錦絵), multi-coloured woodblock prints. The existence of a number of prominent examples predating the ban, however, suggests that ""aizuri-e"" did not simply come about as an alternative to poly-chromatic images. While the earliest recorded use is in an 1829 print by Eisen, Utagawa Sadahide, Hokusai, Hiroshige, Toyokuni II and Kunisada all produced notable examples."
"The increased popularity of ""aizuri-e"" is directly linked to the 1829 importation of the first synthetic colouring agent to Japan. Known in the west as Prussian Blue, Berlin Blue, or ""bero"" (ベロ) as it came to be known, effectively challenged natural indigo as an ""ukiyo-e"" mainstay due to its lower price and decreased susceptibility to fading from light exposure. ""Aizuri"" has been described by one critic as having ""revolutionized landscape prints."""
"Given the lack of colour contrast in the monochromatic ""aizuri-e"", late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This led to the development of ""bokashi"", a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a ""hake"" brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While ""aizuri-e"" themselves were inexpensive to print, ""bokashi"" was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity."
"Utagawa Kunisada (歌川国貞) was born in 1786 in the Honjō district of Edo (present-day Tokyo) into a wealthy family of ferry service owners. He began an apprenticeship with the head of the prestigious Utagawa school of artists, Toyokuni I, in 1807, and took the artist name Kunisada to include the second character (国 - kuni) of his mentor's name. In 1844, Kunisada succeeded his master as Toyokuni III (三代歌川豊国)."
"Kunisada emerged as a book illustrator in 1807 with the series ""Twelve Hours of the Courtesans"" (""Keisei jūnitoki""). ""Kuchi-e"" book illustrations were essential to the success of the then popular ""sharebon"" and ""kibyōshi"" books, and this soon became a lucrative market for Kunisada due to his talent and ambition. His position within the Utagawa studio afforded him access to training from the finest masters, and connections to publishers, actors, theatres and poet's associations. This, in turn, led to many commissions. By the early 1810s, he had opened his own studio, and demand for his illustrations had outstripped that for his master's. His great success was also reputedly linked to his ""convivial and balanced demeanor, and [the fact that] he delivered his commissions on time."""
"Kunisada was ""without a doubt... the most prolific and successful print artist of all time."" He was incredibly prodigious, creating between 35 and 40 thousand designs for individual ""ukiyo-e"" prints during his lifetime. His studio was larger than that of any other print artist, and he had a large stable of several dozen students. As a further indication of his unprecedented success, when he died in 1865 after having headed the Utagawa school for around 40 years, he was the subject of four separate ""shini-e"" memorial portraits. He is buried on the grounds of Banshōin Kōunji Temple in present-day Nakano ward, Tokyo, alongside Toyokuni I (1769–1825) and Kunisada II (1823–1880)."
"Like many artists of the Edo period, Kunisada was associated with a number of names throughout his lifetime."
"Although Kunisada designed many ""surimono"" and fan pictures, most of his works are in the ""ōban"" format. He also produced over sixty paintings."
"Given his incredible output, it is not surprising that Kunisada was active in various genres, including ""kabuki-e"" and ""yakusha-e"" (""kabuki"" actor pictures), ""bijin-ga"" (pictures of beauties), ""yūrei-zu"" (ghost pictures), ""sumō-e"" (sumo wrestler pictures), ""shunga"" (erotica), ""musha-e"" (warrior prints), and ""uchiwa-e"". He is also credited with popularizing ""Genji-e"", a print genre related to the 11th century novel ""The Tale of Genji"", through his 1829-1842 book series, ""Nise Murasaki inaka Genji"" (""A Country Genji by a Fake Murasaki""). In 1808, he began creating ""yakusha-e"", and these were to become the mainstay of his production, making up 60 to 70% of his total works. So prolific was he, that he came to be known as ""Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (""yakusha-e no Kunisada"")."""
"Two popular genres which are under-represented in Kunisada's oeuvre are nature images (""kachō-e""/ 花鳥絵) and landscapes (""fūkei-e""/ 風景絵). He rarely designed pure landscapes, but began in the 1820s or 1830s to incorporate landscape elements into prints featuring beautiful women and actors. ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers"" with its spare background landscape, is an example of this type of piece."
"Despite his success during his own period, Kunisada was not highly regarded in the west until quite recently. Critics today consider Kunisada to have been ""a trendsetter... in tune with the tastes of urban society,"" and credit him with a ""more humanized"" style than his contemporaries, and with bringing a sense of realism to ""ukiyo-e"", particularly in his depiction of the female form."
"Many argue, however, that the quality of Kunisada's later works degraded into ""gaudy and ostentatious"" use of colour, and ""lost... elegance in the human figure"". ""Ukiyo-e"" specialist Rupert Faulkner is particularly scathing, asserting that Kunisada's work ""became noticeably coarser and somewhat clumsy, revealing a cheap and gaudy caricaturism of grotesque facial expressions and exaggerated poses."" It has been suggested that his production generally suffered ""because of over-production and lowering of artistic standards,"" as well as possible mental or physical health issues, which led to Kunisada becoming a near-recluse in 1847. As art historian J. Hillier notes, ""Kunisada's career tells the tragedy of the downfall of ukiyo-e. With evident talent and tremendous verve, his early prints have qualities that link him with the great days of the school, but the great mass of his prints are hastily designed, over-coloured and badly printed."""
"The scene depicted on the fan is of two male ""bugaku"" dancers in full ceremonial costume, who appear to be performing a dance in lock-step with no audience in evidence. ""Bugaku"", made up of the characters for 'dance' (舞-bu) and 'music' or 'entertainment' (楽-gaku), joined Japanese culture from China, Korea, India and Southeast Asia in the late 8th century, as a form of dance performed at the imperial court, as well as at temples and shrines. Dancers assume stylized hand, arm and foot poses accompanied by drumming and the world's oldest surviving orchestral music, ""gagaku"". ""Bugaku"" is often performed by dancers wearing masks to represent fictional characters, though not in Kunisada's print. There are four ""bugaku"" genres: civil, warrior, children's, and running dances. The figures here appear to be performing the latter."
"From the late 1820s, Kunisada began studying painting under Hanabusa Ikkei (英一珪), master of the Itchō school. The art-name appearing on this print, ""Kōchōrō"" (香蝶楼), borrows characters from his teacher's pseudonym (Shinkō) and from the name of the school's founder, Hanabusa Itchō (英一蝶). Both of these artists painted ""bugaku"" scenes prior to ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers,"" which are very different in style from Kunisada's image."
The print is signed near the right edge of the fan. It reads vertically from right to left and top to bottom as follows:
"The double circle mark below Kunisada's signature is a ""toshidama-in"", the distinctive seal used by all generations of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I first adopted it, for reasons unknown, in 1808 or 1809. It is a lucky symbol, referencing gifts of coins given to children at New Year's. Kunisada gave the mark his own unique twist, elongating it and making it a yellow frame with red infill containing his signature. From 1850, he used this cartouche-style almost exclusively."
"The ROM dates the print to sometime between the mid-1820s and 1844; however, there are indications that the date can be narrowed to between 1830 and 1843. Synthetic blue pigment was not introduced to Japan until 1829, and it is unlikely that expensive natural indigo would be used on a medium as cheap as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada's signature is flanked by two circular ""toshidama-in"" seals rather than appearing within an oblong, stylized ""toshidama"" cartouche. This suggests the print belongs to his early career."
"The print was donated to the ROM by Sir Edmund Walker (1848–1924), who was the long-time president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and served as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ROM. Walker began collecting Japanese art in the 1870s, making him one of the earliest collectors in North America. He bought many of his pieces in New York between 1873–1875 and 1881–1886, and during a trip to London in 1909. In 1919, after travelling to Japan, China and Korea, he was named Honorary Consul-General of Japan for Toronto."

"Henry Blight Halicki (October 18, 1940 – August 20, 1989), most commonly known as H. B. ""Toby"" Halicki, was an American director, writer, stunt driver, actor, and filmmaker. Halicki directed the 1974 film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" as well as producing and starring in several other action films. He was killed in an accident while filming ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" in 1989. Wishing to preserve his legacy, his widow, Denice Shakarian Halicki, produced a remake in 2000 along with Jerry Bruckheimer."
"Halicki was born in a Polish-American family in Dunkirk, New York in 1940 and was one of thirteen children. All thirteen children were given nicknames; his was ""Toby"". Toby started to develop his fascination with cars while working in the family towing business, which was established back in 1919. His father was also a second-hand car dealer. Halicki started driving at a young age and developed a wide knowledge of automobiles by the age of ten. When he was a teenager, after the loss of two of his brothers, Halicki decided to move to California and live with one of his uncles."
"Halicki moved from New York to California and worked on vehicles, eventually owning his own impound and towing business. H.B. Halicki Mercantile Co. & Junk Yard was known for its extensive antique automobile and toy collections."
"Halicki wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in 1974."
"There was no official script for the movie, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Halicki supplied most of the cars and used repeated footage of the same vehicles and shots of public incidents to increase the footage. The scene in which a train derailment is observed was not part of the original shooting script; it is in fact a real train that derailed. When the director heard about the wreck, he wanted to incorporate it into the film."
Halicki compacted 10 vertebrae performing the film's jump finale and walked with a limp afterwards.
"Halicki married Denice Shakarian in 1989, shortly before he began filming his 1989 sequel, ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"", in which both of them would star. Halicki bought over 400 automobiles to destroy in the film, which was to feature improved car chases and storyline."
"On August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Toby was preparing for the most dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly. The accident occurred in an area behind the former J.H. Williams Tool factory at 400 Vulcan Street in Buffalo."
"In 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki began work with Jerry Bruckheimer and Touchstone Pictures to produce a 2000 remake of the original 1974 film. The remake included the Fastback Mustang ""Eleanor""."
"In its opening weekend, the remake grossed $25,336,048 from 3,006 US theaters, leading all films that weekend. By the end of the film's theatrical run, it had grossed $101,648,571 domestically and $135,553,728 internationally, comprising a total gross revenue for the film of $237,202,299 worldwide. The popularity of the 2000 remake resulted in illegal copies of the custom ""Eleanor"" car being produced. Denice Halicki successfully sued to stop trademark and copyright infringement."

"Stehr received a PhD in sociology from the University of Oregon in 1970. Between 1967 and 2000, he taught at American and Canadian universities. His last appointment in Canada was that of fellow in Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Study der University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. During the academic year 2002-2003 he was Paul-Lazarsfeld-Professor (a visiting appointment) at the University of Vienna. He is Senior Research Fellow of the Sustainable Development Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, a fellow of the Fellow the Center for Advanved Study of the Humanities, Essen, Germany, editor of the Canadian Journal of Sociology (until 2006), a Fellow of the Royal Society (Canada) and the European Academy of the Sciences and the Arts."
"In 2011, Stehr created the European Center for Sustainability Research (ECS) at Zeppelin University."
"His research interests center on the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies and associated developments in different social institutions of modern society (e.g. science, politics, and the economy) and is focused on these field of attention:"
Knowledge: Knowledge is not merely a model of reality but a model for reality. Knowledge represents a capacity to act.
Knowledge and information: The substance of information primarily concerns the properties of products or outcomes while the stuff of knowledge refers to the qualities of process or inputs.
"Post-industrial society: Innovation are increasingly derivative from research and development; there is a new relation between science and technology because of the centrality of theoretical knowledge, and the weight of the society—measured by a larger proportion of Gross National Product and a larger share of employment—is increasingly shifting toward the knowledge field."
Knowledge society: The foundation for the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies is based on changes in the structure of the economies of advanced societies. The source of economic growth and value-adding activities—increasingly relies on knowledge. The significance of knowledge grows in all spheres of life and in all social institutions of modern society.
"Common sense and scientific knowledge: The growing significance of science and its manifold social utility has led to its having a virtual monopoly on the production of new socially, economically and politically relevant knowledge in modern societies; knowledge that rarely can be contested by religion, nor by politics, and in particular not by daily experience. But this does not mean that ordinary citizens are now the slaves of scientific experts."
Stehr is one of the authors of the Hartwell Paper: A new direction for climate policy after the crash of 2009. The Hartwell Paper arises from a meeting convened by Professor Gwyn Prins of the LSE in February 2010 to consider the implications of developments in climate policy in late 2009.
"Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years. The underlying reason for this is that the UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009. However, the currently dominant approach has acquired"
immense political momentum because of the quantities of political capital sunk into it. But in any case the UNFCCC/Kyoto model of climate policy cannot continue because it crashed in late 2009. The Hartwell Paper sets and reviews this context; but doing so is
not its sole or primary purpose.
The Paper proposes that the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential
"functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be. It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy. It explains the political prerequisite of energy efficiency strategies as a first step and documents how this can achieve real emissions reductions. But, above all, it emphasises the primacy of accelerating decarbonisation of energysupply. This calls for very substantially increased investment in innovation in noncarbon energy sources in order to diversify energy supply technologies. The ultimate goal of doing this is to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less"
than those using fossil fuels. The Hartwell Paper advocates funding this work by low hypothecated (dedicated) carbon taxes. It opens discussion on how to channel such money productively.
