No  it doesn't matter!
Oh God!
I'm gonna fetch my mother in!
For God's sake!
Right!
Right!!
Are you coming to sit in?
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."

THE DAWN
An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the

"On the summit of a wood-crowned hill, rising like a pyramid above moor"
"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"
"Perfectly-running Motor Cars I’ve seen,"
It’s quite a Different Proposition when
"They’re on the Road, and filled With Gasolene!"
"The Moving Motor speeds, and having Sped,"
Moves on. Nor all the Cries and Shrieks of Dread
Shall lure it back to settle Damage Claims;
Not even if the Victims are Half Dead!
"And when at Last you’ve mastered Belts and Bolts,"
"When with no fear of Side-Slips, Jars or Jolts,"
Your Sixty H. P. Racer licks up Miles
"At Lightning Speed,—turn on a few more Volts!"
Then in your Glorious Success exult!
"When your Car plunges like a Catapult,"
Sit tight! Hold hard! Pass Everything in Sight!
And you will be Surprised at the Result!

"CLARE.  Get married, and find out after a year that she's the wrong"

"""I am a barefooted tramp ...."""
The Captain looked critically at him.  This youngster had long hair and

"dressed in a blue blouse without a waistband, and on his head he wore"
"the remains of a straw hat, while his feet were bare."

Or mine in hers had read.

GENERAL FOREWORD
"No word of Preface is necessary to this Volume, except to say that"
"in presenting it to his readers, the author feels that that he is"
fulfilling a promise made to them when Volume I of the series was
issued.
A word of explanation will be found as an introduction to each
"subdivision of the book, which excludes the necessity of making any"
reference to such subdivisions in this General Forward.
THE AUTHOR.
"Salt Lake City, January, 1912."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
GENERAL FOREWORD
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
One of Captain Roberts's pirates. Hanged at the age of 25.
"SMITH, JOHN."
One of the mutinous crew of the _Antonio_. Hanged at Boston in 1672.
"SMITH, JOHN WILLIAMS."
"Of Charleston, Carolina."
"Hanged in 1718 for piracy, at Charleston."
"SMITH, MAJOR SAMUEL. Buccaneer."
At one time a buccaneer with the famous Mansfield.
"In 1641 he was sent, by the Governor of Jamaica, with a party to reinforce"
the troops which under Mansfield had recaptured the New Providence Island
from the Spanish. In 1660 he was taken prisoner by the Spanish and carried
to Panama and there kept in chains in a dungeon for seventeen months.
"DE SOTO, BERNADO."
One of the crew of the schooner _Panda_ that took and plundered the Salem
brig _Mexican_. The crew of the _Panda_ were captured by an English
"man-of-war and taken to Boston. De Soto was condemned to death, but"
eventually fully pardoned owing to his heroic conduct in rescuing the crew
A sleepy old forgotten song.
"Softly the stealthy night descends,"
The black sails fade into the sky:
"Is this not, where the sea-line ends,"
The shore-line of infinity?
I cannot think or dream: the grey
"Unending waste of sea and night,"
"Dull, impotently infinite,"
Blots out the very hope of day.
RAIN ON THE DOWN.
"NIGHT, and the down by the sea,"
And the veil of rain on the down;
And she came through the mist and the rain to me
From the safe warm lights of the town.
"The rain shone in her hair,"
And her face gleamed in the rain;
And only the night and the rain were there
As she came to me out of the rain.
BEFORE THE SQUALL.
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"
"it."""
"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."

"MY DEAR WHITE,"
The publication of this book is a business arrangement between you and

of friendship and esteem. This then is to remind you of pleasant hours

"In the Table of Contents, the ""PART III"" division precedes Chapter VII,"
but in the body of the book it precedes Chapter VIII.
"Page numbers in this book are enclosed in curly braces.  For its Index,"
a page number has been placed only at the start of that section.  In
"the HTML version of this book, page numbers are placed in the left"
margin.
Footnote numbers are enclosed in square brackets.  Each chapter's
footnotes have been renumbered sequentially and moved to the end of

"PERKINS, BENJAMIN."
One of Quelch's crew. Captured at Marblehead in 1704.

Of Guernsey.
"Tried for piracy in 1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and found guilty."
Hanged on November 8th at White Point. Buried in the marsh below low-water
mark.
"PETERSON, CAPTAIN."
"Of Newport, Rhode Island."
"In 1688 he arrived at Newport in a ""barkalonga"" armed with ten guns and"
"seventy men. The Governor prosecuted him for piracy, but the grand jury,"
"which consisted of friends and neighbours of Peterson, threw out the bill."
"Among other charges, Peterson was accused of selling some hides and"
"elephants' teeth to a Boston merchant for £57, being part of the booty he"
had previously taken out of prizes in the West Indies.
"PETERSON, ERASMUS."
Tried for piracy with the rest of Captain Quelch's crew at Boston. Was
"hanged there on June 30th, 1704. When standing on the gallows ""He cryed of"
"injustice done him and said, 'It is very hard for so many lives to be"
"withholding the non-essentials. But, above all, let us fill the scrip"
"with gifts that the child need never reject, even when he passes"
through “the gate of sleep.”

The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans

"_Peter-Hansen_, Erik."
"_Peter_ Lewis, a true tale."
When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of
"the alphabet, cross-reference from the rejected one, as _Thomas"
Cantuariensis_. See _Thomas Becket_.
Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"
"_Brown_ and _Browne_, and the French names beginning with _Saint_ and"
_Sainte_. As readers may not always know the spelling of the author's
"name, cross-references should be made: e.g., _Brown_. See also _Browne_."
Arrange by the forename headings in which the family name is the
same.
"No attention is to be paid to prefixes, as _Bp., Capt., Dr., Hon., Sir,"
"Fräulein, Miss, Mlle., Mme., Mrs._, or to suffixes, as _D.D., F.R.S.,"
"LL.D._, etc."
"When the forenames are the same, arrange chronologically."
"No attention is to be paid to the titles _Sir_, etc.: e.g., _Bart, T."
"L._, comes before _Bart, Thomas_, for the same reason that _Bart_ comes"
before _Barta_.
Forenames not generally used should be neglected in the arrangement.
When an author is generally known by one of several forenames he will
"heard it, for he stood up and forced a smile upon his long sad face."
Noll went close to him hurriedly:
"“One word, Netherby--quick, before she comes--do you know where Betty"
is?” he asked hoarsely.
Netherby smiled a sad smile:
"“Ah, Noll, that _you_ should have to ask _me_ that!”"
Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.
"As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went into the"
"old lady’s room. She was sitting in the window, looking out; and she"
turned at his footfall.
Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the harsh light
had gone out of her eyes:
“Won’t you be a little lonely here to-night?” Noll asked her.
"“No,” she said--“she has taken seats for all three of us.”"

A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the

"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
"go on when one was tired--tired of her--and wanting only Gyp, only his"
"own wife?  That was a funny thing!  And now, when, for an hour or two, he"
"had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy--yes, happy--this fellow"
"must come, and stand there with his face of a sphinx!  And he said"
pettishly:
"""Well, Paul! sit down.  What troubles have you brought?"""
Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down.  He struck even Fiorsen by
his unsmiling pallor.
"""You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday."
"He has no music in his soul."""
Fiorsen sat up.
"""Satan take Mr. Wagge!  What can he do?"""
"""I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant--the girl is"
"young."""
"Fiorsen glared at him, and said:"
"""Why did you throw me that cursed girl?"""
"Rosek answered, a little too steadily:"
"""I did not, my friend."""
"""What!  You did.  What was your game?  You never do anything without a"
"game.  You know you did.  Come; what was your game?"""

Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!

Frank Corson rang the bell and waited at the door of Rhoda Kane's
apartment. The door opened. She wore a pale blue brunch coat. Her hair
"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"
drawn.
"Her eyes were slightly red, as though she might have been crying."
"""Hello, Rhoda."""
"""Hello, Frank."""

"""I should have climbed that peak long ago if you, Miss Torsen, hadn't"
"forbidden me,"" said the lawyer."
"""You'd never have made it,"" said Mrs. Molie in an indifferent tone. This"
was probably her revenge. She turned to the Dane again as though ready to
believe him capable of anything.
"""I shouldn't want anyone to think of climbing that peak,"" said Miss"
"Torsen. ""It's as bare as a ship's mast."""
"""What if I tried it, Gerda?"" the manufacturer asked his wife with a smile."
"""After all, I'm an old sailor."""
"""Nonsense,"" she said, smiling a little."
"""Well, I climbed the mast of a schooner last spring."""
"""Where?"""
"""In Iceland."""
"""What for?"""
"""I don't know, though--all this mountain climbing--I haven't much use for"
"it,"" said the manufacturer."
"""What did you do it for? What did you climb the mast for?"" his wife"
repeated nervously.
The manufacturer laughed.
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.

"nothing of a swim--"""

"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""

AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.
ON THE HEATH.
HER face’s wilful flash and glow
Turned all its light upon my face

The Frangipani growled like a trapped bear.
"He raised his sword, put forward his shield."

Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney's eager hands. It was an
"ordinary case knife such as the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed"
to two initials that had been carved on the case.

ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.

“You are here on a mission for your father?”

"“No business at all,” replied Jack."
“We know better than that!” the stranger answered.
“What do you want of us?” asked Jack.
"“We want information now in your possession,” answered the fellow,"
looking Jack sharply in the eyes.
“What kind of information?”
“We want to know where certain documents are.”
"“You’ll have to ask some one else, then.”"
“We are certain that you have the information we require.”

_C. Custance._ And he stood by

For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"
Wherefore I beseech you with me to be a witness
That in all my life I never intended thing less.

Yourself knows well enough.

The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.

"“Thank you,” said Yvonne. “You were always kind-hearted, Amédée--oh,"
it was a horrible mistake--it can’t be altered. You see that I am
helpless.”
"“Why, my child,” said he, seating himself again, “I keep on telling you"
it is a farce--like all the rest of life. I only laugh. And now let us
talk a little before I pop into the coffin again. What is the name of
the thrice happy being?”
"“Oh, don’t ask me, I beg you,” said Yvonne shivering. “It is all"
so painful. Tell me about yourself--your voice--Is it still in good

“Never better. I am singing here this afternoon.”

The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.

"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"

"“I'll go and tell her now,” said John."
“Let me just say how d' ye do to her first. I won't stay a minute.”
The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great
High Favourite and chatted gaily for a while. Then she commanded him to
sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”
"“He has been talking to me quite beautifully for a long time,” said"
"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"
“I'm so glad.” She turned to Herold. “Are you going to get married?”
"“No,” smiled Herold."

"3rd-5th April           They receive Kula gifts, exchange presents"
and trade in Vakuta.

6th-10th April          The Dobuans (as well as the Amphlettans)
"remain in Sinaketa, receiving Kula presents,"
giving pari gifts and trading.
"10th April              They all leave Sinaketa, receiving talo'i"
(farewell) gifts. The Dobuans sail south (and
the Amphlettans to Kayleula and the smaller
Western Trobriand Islands).
10th-14th April         The Dobuans are engaged in fishing in the S.
Lagoon.

"To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,"

And my heart is wild with delight;
"I hear her voice through the midnight calling,"
As I lie awake in the night.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And I see her bright eyes gleam;
"She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,"
And made again in a dream.
MUSIC AND MEMORY.
To K.W.
"ACROSS the tides of music, in the night,"
"Her magical face,"
A light upon it as the happy light
Of dreams in some delicious place
Under the moonlight in the night.
"Music, soft throbbing music in the night,"
Her memory swims
"Into the brain, a carol of delight;"
The cup of music overbrims
"With wine of memory, in the night."
"here.' And again she tried to shut the door, but I prevented her."
'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod
"down the passage, and though I knocked again in a rage, the door"
remained closed.
"I fell back and looked at the house. An elderly man in a grave, sober"
"dress was passing, among others, and I caught his eye."
'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of
"Safety,' he said dryly. 'His brother is prefect of this ward. But here"
is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'
"I thanked him, and made but two steps to Herr Krapp's side. He was the"
Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!
"""She is not very well,"" she answered, rather coldly."
"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"
"congratulated."""
Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"
"I ring for tea, Mary?"""
"""They'll bring it. You haven't wished him joy."""
"""Oh, are you in the new Ministry?"""
"""I have that honour, Miss Derosne. I hope you are on our side?"""
"""I don't quite know which side you are on--now,"" observed Alicia, in"
slow but distinct tones.
Coxon grew red.
"SHAKE out your hair about me, so,"
That I may feel the stir and scent
Of those vague odours come and go
The way our kisses went.
"Night gave this priceless hour of love,"
"But now the dawn steals in apace,"
And amorously bends above
The wonder of your face.
"“Farewell” between our kisses creeps,"
"You fade, a ghost, upon the air;"
"Yet, ah! the vacant place still keeps"
The odour of your hair.
SOUVENIR.
HOW you haunt me with your eyes!
"Still that questioning persistence,"
"Sad and sweet, across the distance"

Those old days of love and lies.

"Only, always, questioning,"
Those divinest eyes can bring
"Memories of certain summers,"

"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"
"drew down his face to her between her two hands, and kissed him."
She clung to him:
"“Thou must give me a bed too,” she whispered hoarsely; “I have no bed.”"
She was trembling.

She nodded:

“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.

For some caprice of idle breath

The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....

He speaks English as yet with a strong foreign accent--but lack of
"experience may have more than something to do with it. If you come,"
I’ll let you play with him.
I live in a whirl of tangled emotions in these days.
"T’other evening I went home, to my father’s marble halls, to seek"
the old gentleman on an affair of hot urgency. It was in the long
hours. I lost some temper--the butler being a sphinx of ducal
"know-nothingness--so I rang up the housekeeper. Yes, she knew where a"
telegram would find Sir Pompey if I would leave it with her.
I!
Leave it!
"Gods! said I, am I utterly disinherit?"
Forthwith the heir of this branch of the Malahides demanded the address.
It lay at St. John’s Wood!
"My mom never believed in you, but I told her."
I told everybody.

Maybe we should've gotten the bigger fridge.

Ooh!
Look at that.
That's a full freezer.

You going to be a good boy?
BYRON:
Yeah.
Give me a kiss good-bye.

Stop right there.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter where I can see them.
And spread your legs.
Simon says.
Can I turn around now?
Why don't you just stay like that?
- Fantastic.
This is my girlfriend Rhonda.
- Hello.
"- Hi, Larry."
Nice to meet you.
Can you believe it?
I hooked up with a model.
"Boy, you lucked out."

Morning.

How's it going?

"Thank you, I'd love to come."
"Yeah, and no gifts, okay?"
No gifts.
Where are the plans?
- Mr. Wooster has them.
- Wooster?
Who's he?
A friend of mine.
"Well, where is he?"

Come on.
You two go on out.
Come on.

He was here a moment ago.
"Oh, there you are."
"Here he is, miss."
Bertie!
"Bertie, are you hurt?"
"Marjorie, I was just having the most beautiful dream about you."
"Oh, this is my cousin, Mr. McDermott, the inventor."
- How do you do?
"Jeeves, shake hands for me."
"- Yes, sir."
Manville was going to try and get the plans of his invention.
He was going to sell them to a foreign government.
You don't know?
[raucous laughter]
"Robin, you're crazy!"
I like this girl.
Normal.
Everything's normal.
Ahh!
Is this the new futon?
"- Yes, it is, in fact."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We just bought it together.
It's my new favorite thing.
And... and you know it turns into a bed?
"So really, it's like two things."
A couch that turns into a bed?
"Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it."
"Yeah, right?"
"All right, watch this."

The Navy wants me to be a recruiter there.
Texas?
When?
Three weeks.
"But, Dad..."
We still got half our season to play.
I'm aware of that.
"Well, maybe I could stay with the Johnsons."
Unh-unh.
We move as a family.
I don't have a choice in this.
What kind of baseball do they have?
They don't.
I hear they might be starting some summer ball.
I think it'd be a neat idea.

I'm gonna show you the right way to take a punch.
"OK, hit me."

- Right in my stomach.
"Hit me as hard as you can, just at my stomach."
That wasn't as hard as I can.
I know.
I hope not.
Hit me again.
Harder.
Seriously.

Cut.
Could someone please get Mr.Hilliard out of Dunkirk?
"Find Mrs.Cole. Train ticket, Ration card, authorization to travel."
Oh!
Don't be nervous.
Mr.Hilliard won't notice you're gone.
It's not Mr.Hilliard. It's Ellis.
He's going to be so disappointed in me.
For missing' the opening.
For not turnin' up to the last minute.
Nonsense!
I might change the title.
You should totally record it.
"No, it's not there yet."
Still needs some tweaks.
Not from what I've just heard.
Let's do it.
Olivia does all the recording.
I don't know how to work the equipment.
It's easy.
"All you do is press ""Record,"""
this button right here.
I guess.
It'll be fun.

He insulted her.

Tried to break her arm.
You will?
You want another one?

But it didn't matter.
"No matter what I did,"
I chose
Angela.
Angela.
Like a name would protect me.
"That I dreamed I could have a life, a chance."
Didn't matter.
It wasn't done with me.
"It's coming for me, Father, I know it."

My name is Regan MacNeil.
I'm Chris MacNeil.
I've come to see my daughter.
I don't want to go.
Go home.
You know the way.
I don't want to go.
You'll be fine.

Don't touch me!

We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?
- A pain pill.
- I don't want it.
- Shut up and take it.
- I don't want it!
Now I'll have to think of something else.
We're going to lower you down.
She's got to be French.
I'm parked on Kattegat Road.
A red Ferrari.

- You're Chinese.
"- I'm French, honey."

- Fucking tart.
That was school French.
You're not from France.
Do you want company or not?
"300, cash in advance."
- What's that?
- 1500.
Say your name is Michelle and say you love me in French.
- And then I'll break your arm.
- Like hell you will.
- 3000.

4500.
That's more than you make in a week.

Where is it?
Let go of me!

"Anyway, you don't like Arthur Askey."
ARE THERE THINGS SHE WON'T DO?
THINGS YOU WANT TO TRY?
"UH, YEAH, SURE."
I LIKE TO TRY THINGS.
IS THAT OKAY?
GOD.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GOOD.
YOU WANT TO FUCK ME NOW?

She is going to Mumbai.
Party is fine.
But till 2 o'clock?
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?
I worry when I think about it.
Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.
"Well, she is our daughter."
She will make us proud.
And keep your diary with you.
It pricks me the whole night.

Mother and daughter's meeting is over?

It's over.
Gul.
Last night you returned home very late.
I didn't like that.
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
Yeah.
"Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?"
You prick!
This is no time for jokes.
What a fucking loser.
Go!

- No.
Don't just stand around.
Check the back.
What's that?
Fucking bastard...
Byeong-gyu!

Hurry UP-
Is that him?
Over there.
Where?
Follow me.
Where?
What the...?
Who's that?
What is that thing?
Don't come any closer.
Back off.
Back off.
Stop it.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?

"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."

Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.

NOBODY EVER HELPED ME.
"NOW, YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE!"
AMOS KYNE DID AND GRIFFITH WOULD...
AND I WOULD.
I'D DO ANYTHING YOU ASKED ME.
YOU BETTER STICK TO YOUR FRIEND.
HE'S YOUR TYPE.
YOU'RE MY TYPE.
SHALL WE PHONE MY MOTHER AND FATHER?
AND ASK THEM IF YOU SHOULD MARRY
A REPORTER WITHOUT A PENCIL?
TO TELL THEM I'M GOING TO.
"OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW!"
IS THAT YOUR BOSS CALLING?
DOES HE USUALLY CALL AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?
EVERY NIGHT.

YES.
JUST A MOMENT.

"What do you mean, ""do with him""?"
He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."

Peppers and everything.
"No, that's all right. I had my lunch."
-Can I get coffee?
"-No, thanks."
So.
What do you think?
"Well, same old thing."
This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.
-He's a cracker.
-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.
Not this one.
This one's a terrier.
"Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase."
"Me, you, dinner."
Pi-cha-kow!

I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Agh!

"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

But listen.
Be careful.

You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?
OK.
"OK, Jesus."
"Tony, what?"
"Are you trying to scare me, because it's not working?"
I love you.
I'm saying it again.
OK?
And you.
"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.
Is it like I feel with you and Mom?
Is there anyone in particular?
No.
"Well, if there ever is, you just let me know."
I'm always here for you.
"- Okay, Dad."
- Okay.

She's just a cat.
"David, come inside."
So who's out here?
"Huh, Jess?"
Don't start that again.
Wait!
You're not gonna answer me?
I don't know!
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.

I didn't call you.
Excuse me?

How are we in contact?
It's normal.
Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.

Let me at least hold you.
"I'm hurting, Jemina."
Jemina speaking.
-What are you doing there?
Taking care of this fool.
-Good.
I want to talk to him.
-He's sleeping.
Taisto is in the hospital.
He's about to die.
It's high time to come see him.
I'll come right away.
"-Not you, honey."
"Calm down, Mom."
I've got an idea.
- Yes...
Straight ahead.
Good night!
"Come on, we can't stay herei."
- He says that...
- What does he say?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Jimmy, you can't come here."
Never.
My father...
the war... he's sick.
I brought this for him.
- I see.
- Yes.
"- Pretty, isn't it?"
- Yes.
"But put it away, I can't take it."
My father musn't know.
I have to go.
I need to drop it off.
Wait.
"No, wait, listen..."
"I wanted to say, Jimmy, that I'm very happy when I'm with you."
- But I have to go.
- Wait.
What a lovely butt.
So firm.
It's marvellous.
"It's lovely, very love."
Come!
"Come, yes, like that."
- Oh!
- [Laughing]
- Albert!
- [Claire] Forget it!
Forget it!
- Why?
I need a bigger man.
- Bigger?
- Yeah.
- What do you -
- He's -
- Bigger in what way?
- He's too short for me.
- I need a tall man.
- He's too -
He's too...
He's too short?
When do we take off all our clothes?
"Ah, Helen."
Helen!
[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.
- l...
I don't give any other woman a chance.
- I've noticed that.
"You know what, Helen?"
I know.
"- Well, we got 'em."
- Yeap.
- Yours look awesome on you.
"- Yea, so did yours."
"Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day."
Are we cool?
Yea.
Course.
Precious.
"Hey, you hungry or anything?"
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
"Yea, screw food."
I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.
It's my Dad.
Really?
"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."
See you Daze!
Hey Dad.

"Are you... uhm, April?"
Hi.
Hi.
I was a friend of your father's.
I just want to let you know that...
Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Erica!
Unh!
Over here.
"Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.
Hello?
Over here.
"Quickly, Sheriff!"
The air lock is closing.
"Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding..."
"Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?"
Watch where you're going!

"Please, please, please?"
-Andy!
"-Now, we need to find a ship"

-Wait a minute.
"No, Buzz!"
This way.
-There's a special ship.
I just saw it.

Hyperactive hyperdrive.
And Astro... turf!

"All right, Buzz, get ready."
And...
-And the universe explodes!
"-Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket."
Buzz!
Has to run down on fire?
"No, actually."
"He's kind of looking forward to it,"
Because it's sort of like two stunts in one.
"It's a regular fire burn and the stair fall,"
So he wants it for his reel.
So he's kind of looking forward to it.
Is everybody ready?
"Kimberly, are you ready?"
-Ready.

There's no team play in Kung Fu.
But you're teaching them Kung Fu.
No!
I'm teaching them the spirit of Kung Fu.
You know only the form.
This can't be true.

I don't understand teamwork.
But...

Maybe we can talk.
Call me.

Then there was the other mom.
Mommy?
"How was school, baby?"
Hm?

What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
You want the neighbors to see me?

They're gonna take me away if they see me.
"I'm sorry, Mommy."
"Oh, I'm so..."

Tell me something.
Will you come to office at this hour every day?
"Actually, sir.."

No.
You don't have to call me sir.
I am used to working in a friendly ambiance.
So I guess Vivek is fine.
- Okay.
Come.
You got time?
It takes you an hour to bring a cup of coffee.
"Yes, sir."
He is the spoilt brat of our office.

God.
For me what to do grant the power and wisdom.
Must find the head with me.

"I meant me, not you."
-On the bed.
-On the bed.
On the bed.
Bed.
Okay.

Do you want the lights on or off?
Is she naked yet?
Don't start until I can see.
You turned off the lights.
We can't see.
All set?
What's the matter?

-I want to be a gentleman.
Doesn't a gentleman bring enough for everybody?
This is the greatest moment of my life.
"Okay, that's it."
Time's up.
Any questions?
"After sex, you smoke."
It's a rule.
Anybody have any matches?
-No.

I feel it now.
We're different.
How?
We're men.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Fuck 'em all.
I want to have sex.
Right now?
Right this very moment.

- Mm-hmm.
Huh.
"And I only had half a glass of wine, so you can fill the rest of it up."
"Oh, and don't be a gentleman."
You're not gonna hurt me.
How's Paul doing tonight?
It's not Paul.
It's my assistant.

Don't let them see me like this.
Rose and Frankie.

- All right.
"OK, OK."
He's in the hospital.
I'm off to see him now.
"Well, I'm not going."
OK.
If he thinks having a heart attack can make up for...
"Well, he can think again."
Maybe you should go and see him.
- Why?
- I don't know.
You never know when you'll see him again.
Like I care.
What if something happens?
What if it was the last time?
- I'll see you later.

"I mean, I don't want to."
Oh...
Take me.
Go ahead.

But I do want your services.
My job is to fuck.
At your home.
If I report that you're harassing me...

Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.

You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.

Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.

Great.
I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please.
Don't compare me to a dog.
Stop!
You can come in!
You can come in!
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything...?
Would you have just kept bleeding...?
You'd have died?
I knew you wouldn't let me...
You can borrow one of my mom's old dresses if you want...!
Hello!

It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?
"- An FF, please."
- An FF?
I'm Allan.

You want to sit down?

"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure."
- You mean it?
"Oh, yeah."
Anything you say.
I knew it.
I knowed I made a good choice!
In what?
My best friend.
"See you tomorrow, buddy!"
"McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,"
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Number one.
Number one...
"Ah, number one!"
"- Ah, this is nice."
"- Hey, Stickers."
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me.
You gotta be careful.
I scared myself scaring you scaring me.
"- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared."
"- No, of course not."
No.
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.
When?
Just now?
"What, what did, what did you hear?"
Something about a helicopter ride.
"Oh, yeah."
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."

What about the last of the big-time spenders?
You make him?
No.
You?
He's spreadin' it around like the Russians are in Jersey.
Nice.
What do you say we stick around and give him a tail?
Come on.
Just for fun.
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
What for?
You wanna play hide the salami with his old lady?
Yeah.
[Laughs]
[No Audible Dialogue]
"Miss, uh, can I ask you about those boots there?"
Uh-
"[Exhales, Sniffles]"
Monica.
- Who in the hell's that?
- Who keeps score?
- [Jimmy] Hey.
- Hmm?
"- Kissy devil, isn't he?"
Look at him.
- Yeah.
"- Well, they're all cousins."
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
I'm too far away!
[ Grunts ]
"No, no!"
Look up here!
[ Grunts ]
Hey!
Who's the wiseguy?
She saw me!
She saw me!
"Oh, there's Steven, just flyin' around."
[ Chuckles ]
"No, Amethyst, come back!"
"Wait, can Steven fly?"
"Yeah, I think I remember that."
"No, no, I'm thinking of Lapis!"
"Hey, Steven!"
How did you learn how to fly?
Amethyst!
Go get help!
What?
!
"Ugh, she can't hear me."
"Hey, air-Steve!"
Amethyst!
"I need you to -- dang, too slow."
Better ask quicker.
What'd you say?
"I could really use your assistance dealing with the sudden appearance -- aw, rats."
...of a power which previously was unbeknownst to me which I can't control -- umm.
"Dude, summarize!"
Go get Garnet!
Hmm.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do
# Do-do-do-do-do

"So, you get a turkey baster and you..."
Is that singing?
I can't hear anything.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.

You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
God.
I want this baby.
"But it's not that simple, is it?"
"I mean, it might turn out to be... brownish."
"Oh, right."
And is Moz racist?
No.
"That's not the point, is it?"
It's just... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm comin'!
"'Ey, that's what got you into trouble in the first place."
- Hiya.
Is Moz in?
- He's off hunter-gathering.
He's out gettin' some cigs.
- Can I wait for him?
- Who are you?
Craig.
Friends call me Craigie.
Moz calls me Craigie.
I've got a delivery for him.
Really good gear.
He's been asking us to come round for ages.
- Shall I spark up a doobie?
- I suppose that's the least you could do.
Yeah.
- You haven't got a beer?
"- I have, yeah."
"- You two lesbos, then?"
- What?
- I'm bi.
She's bi-curious.
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."
Kendall.
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?
"Wasn't too much traffic, was there?"
What freeway did you take?
"Well played, Castle."
"You beat me, unfair and square."
All right.
Let's get this over with.
Where is she?
Her text said it was important.
I don't know.
"- Let's go, then."
- Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
I don't know.
"Ah, now, Jesus..."
"- No, I do know."
- Well?
I'm not telling.
"Now, look..."
"Jesus, do you hear that?"
Gobshite!
"Now, don't start that."
Just tell us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
"- I just can't, right?"
"- Well, is he married?"
"No, he's not."
"Well, that's something I suppose."
"Ah, Kay..."
"Jesus, stop it, will you?"
"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.
"Go on, get in there."
Go.
Get in.
Go on.
Will he marry you?
"No, I don't think so."
"Ooh, the Iouser."
"That's cheatin', that is."
- It's not a game.
"- I know that, Kay."
"I mean, it's his fault as much as Sharon's... isn't it, whoever he is."
Everybody leaves.
"First, my father."
"Monk, don't do this now."
"- Then, Trudy."
Trudy didn't leave you.
Sharona.
"Now, Dr. Kroger..."
I can't blame Natalie for leaving.
"I'd leave me, too, if I had the chance."
"God, I am the king of Garfunkel."
I am oozing Garfunkel.
"She'll be back, Monk."
She just needs time to cool off.
That's right.
She probably feels worse than you do.
She looks pretty happy to me.
"Oh, would you just turn it off?"
Please.
It's just...
It's too painful.
"No, no."
Wait.
Did she just say 15?
I've got four numbers here.
Our next number is 33. 3-3.
"So nice, they named it twice."
Oh.
- My God.
"God, I can't stand it anymore."
All right...
And our final number for $212 million is... 54.
54.
The next departure will be Los Angeles to Chicago.
"Help you, sir?"
"Change, sir."
Sir!
Change.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
"-I've got 'em all, what do you want?"
-You want one?
"Okay, new shooter comin' into the game."
"All right, guys, four."
I got it.
Who wants a hard-ways four?
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?
Right.
You got it.
What about you?
Dollar here.
"Okay, roll 'em."
Come on.
Don't touch this money.
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.
"-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night."
"-Honey, gimme some money."
"Come on, we're gettin' lucky."
These guys don't know craps from wheat or somethin'.
Come on!
"No, I'm not giving it to you."
What?
"No, you don't understand."
This is your last chance.
Get out with your hands up.
Here he comes.
He drives like a cop.
Pull up to him.
"Come on, fellas, easy."
My leg!
Something's wrong with my leg.
- Where's Dad?
"- Tommy, listen..."
"He's been shot, Tommy."
The killer got away.
Daddy!
Jesus Christ!
Look who's here.
"- Tommy, sorry about your father."
"- Thanks, Don."
You just couldn't stay away.
Why come to the sentencing?
We've already heard your testimony.
- Uncle Nick.
"- Hi, Tommy."
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know.
- How's the leg?
- Okay.
- I don't want to be here.
- You're a better man than I am.
"Tommy, they got the guy that killed your father."
- What is this?
- His name's Kesser.
He couldn't even lift those women.
-Three deuces.
CHARLEY:
You can't beat that boy.
-Nobody can beat that kid.
"-That's right, Charley."
Nobody ever has.
"You ought to know that, Bill."
"Yeah, I know."
Six.
"Misdeal, isn't it;"
"Oh, have you got six too;"
Five. I could've used another.
HORTON:
"Look, kid, gambling is my business."
Yeah.
And I know my business.
"After this, if I've got six cards, I'll make it known."
Sure.
You bet.
You deal.
-Any of you seen Judge Chamberlain;
"-No, what do you want with him;"
MAN 1 :
His office wants him.
CHARLEY:
Try the bank.
"Forget it, Joe."
He didn't mean anything.
"It's all right, Charley."
"All right, kid, you're the judge."
-Judge of what;
"-Go ahead, deal."
I'm going inside.
You can just stay here and watch for sharks.
OK.
"[Whispering] Yeah, you go."
I'll stay and...
What?
Sharks?
Ariel!
"[Grunts] Ariel, I can't..."
I mean...
"- Ariel, help!"
- [Laughs]
"- Oh, Flounder."
- [Whispers] Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
"Flounder, don't be such a guppy."
I'm not a guppy. [grunts]
This is great.
"I mean, I really love this."
"Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner... [screams] Ariel!"
"[Grunts] Oh, are you OK?"
"Yeah, sure."
No problem.
I'm OK.
Shh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Oh, my gosh!"
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow!
Cool!
"But, uh, what is it?"
"I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will."
- Piss off
- I´m at the dancefloor.
- We're out of coke.
- I'II never last the night.
I've just seen Danny.
Yugo Danny.
Over there.
- What's up?
"- What's up, Simon?"
Happy Birthday.
- Thanks for the drinks.
- Order whatever you like.
- How can I help you?
- We need some blow.
- That hard-hitter blow?
- I haven't any on me.
- Can you get some?
- Maybe.
But I've no wheels.
- I'II drive.
- When do we get it?
I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.
- I haven't got it.
- We haven't got that much.
Then I can't help you.
Here.

There's your answer.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come with me.
Let's confirm this.
"Schmidt, how you doing?"
"Uh, not -- not -- n-not good."

C-can't -- can't feel my legs.
You look nervous.
Nervous?
No.
"Well, you should be nervous, because if he's lying -- if I learn that he's wasting my time --"
"Hey, guys!"
Come here!
There's something wrong!
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-
- I ca-- I can't...breathe.
He's dead.
You killed him.
What if he was lying?
!
He wasn't lying!
He gave you the answer!
Ask your guy!
Rashad!
Because this sleeping in all day till you go to work at night is not gonna fly on my day off.

Honey?

I'm...
Yeah.
I'm tired.
Okay.
"Handcuffs might seem like overkill, but they're going on."
"They're going on, okay?"
You have the right to remain...
- This is a stupid law.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Hey, Twister."
Eddie?
"Daddy didn't let you out, huh?"
Good boy.
I am sure...
Ed.
"Jeez, it's almost 2:00."
Are you kidding me?
You didn't feed Twister.
You didn't let him out.
Peed all over the floor.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 2.
"I don't care if you don't wanna eat, but the dog's gotta eat."
- Wow.
Okay.
"- All right, get up."

Every time I pass my bank now I can hear the lnstateller machine calling my name and laughing.
-So you need money for psychiatric help?
MAC:
Heh-heh.
Harry. listen to this.
I have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a condo conversion.
"If I play my cards right. my 2000 could turn into $20,000 by Christmas."
I'm only $400 short of my goal.
I'll take anything. a buck. spare change.

Okay. fine.

"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.
"- Oh, I don't have a dog."
- I do.
Lola.
My pug.
- You have a pug named Lola?
"- Yeah, short for Lolita."
"- And she's getting pretty fat, dude."

Ten rounds of jumping jacks!
"Yo, up!"
Up!
Up!
Come on!

He's in the kitchen with Nicole's mom.
"OK, those two fingers on those..."
That...
Yeah.
Second fret.
Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch...
catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
My name... is Indrid
"Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
"Gordon, all that..."
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
Earthquake in Ecuator.
More than three hundred deads.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
"Yes, sure."

"Pardon, my Mariska."
Which on side shall we start it?
"Below or above, totally all the same."

Very good.
Now like this.
Some.
Now that.
Great.
Ready.
Come on.
What's it like?
What?
Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.
"Don't worry, my doll."
Don't cry.
Forget about it.
"No, grandma."
I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.
- We have a winner.
- Two reais.
- It's cheaper in the circus.
- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.
So you bought a bed.
Yeah.
"What is that, a king?"
Pillow top?
"Oh, my God."
You really are a chemistry teacher.
You mind?

I can't believe it.
"- She hasn't come back yet, huh?"
"- At least, nobody's seen her."
"Alright, now you go back to the hotel."
You
- And...
see if you can find out what's going on.
It's so unlike my wife.
I'll take care of the police and join you as soon as I can.
Look here.
Don't worry.
It's probably some stupid misunderstanding.
"If I find anything out before you get back, I'll telephone you here."
Wait.
This guy's Ollie?
They fucking talk about Ollie all the time.
I thought they made him up.
What?
"It's always like, ""we went to the zoo with Ollie."
"We built a fort with Ollie."""
"""Yeah, okay."""
Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
To protect him and educate him.
"Provide him with wise counsel, so that when the time comes, he will be equipped to reign."
"I will treat him, the Dauphin, as my own son."
I know you will.

Man on PA:
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Oh, shoot."
I'm in it now.
We've been open six months and had not one customer.
"You don't think it's -- it ain't my dancing, is it?"
"Yes, it is your dancing."
Show me your shapes.
"Oh, I got a ton."
"Here, check this out."

I better go home and practice me some shapes.
"Yes, you will!"
You better go!

"Okay, here we go."
Here comes a chair.
Close enough.
What are you doing Meatwad?
That way?
Excuse me.

"Let's go, let's go!"
Look.

Febo!
"I have to admit, I've never been there."
You knew I'd be here.
Are we even?
- Come with me to Capri.
- No.
I believe in my marriage.
Though...
"Febo, Palm..."
Did you find the dogs?
Not yet.
It's my fault.
"- You're a good person, Captain."
"- No more than you are, Mrs. Wyatt."
"What's this about ""net weight in the morning""?"

I can't believe I'm old enough to have watched people play in those shorts.
"Hey, Marissa."
Marissa?

"And one, two, three, up."
"Sweatpants, no pockets."
We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.

Right now!
What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.
Who are you?
"- No, I'm fine."
Go away.
- Go where?
She has a lot built up inside her.
Let's stay quiet for a bit.
I'm just here to look for a friend.
"Alright, I'll be quiet."
Your friend is in this room?
"Then, why are you screaming?"
Everyone's in bed at this hour.
You have to be quiet.
"Okay, sir, I'm sorry."
It's empty.
Come on over.
"Here, take this."
"- Careful, careful."
- Okay.
Slowly.
Oh no.
"Good, good."
Go ahead.
"Quiet, quiet."
Where am I?
Where is this?

–What?
–Vic got shot.
–Can we leave?
–Shouldn't be much longer.
"Oh, please."
Don't walk out on me again.
Just please don't leave me alone.
"Look, um..."
I believe you.
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.
I was with him all night.
"If I thought he did this, I would tell you."
Are you kidding?
"Great, I've a free chauffeur."
Bro Michael!

No scorpion tattoo?
"I don't, Inspector."
Then why call yourself Scorpion King?
"My nickname is Scorpion, last name King."
So they call me Scorpion King.
Stupid name!

You act like a gangster.
You just have money.
Let's go.
Change your name!
What's this?

That woman -

"Aren,t they on the table?"
"You know, I really feel awful."
What are they doing?

"Do you want me to finish, or do you want me to leave it how it is?"
Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.
I'm 18.
She's 17.

- How about you?
- I'm fine.
- Let's get out of here.
"- Yeah, let's."
- Were you surprised?
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."

Nobody's joking with you!
Think I just fell in love.
So we're friends.
Yeah.
You wanna come in?
"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
That's okay.
You can just watch.
"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."

Sort of an odd thing to say.
"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
In the back yard.
"What part of ""My dad died of lung cancer"" is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?"
What?
"Do not lie to me, Ben."
"Please, okay?"
Are you serious?
"Well, what do you think?"
Yeah...
Go ahead...
She's all yours.
Whas wrong?
No good?
I can't get it up.

"Right on a nice, sharp curve..."
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts!
Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.
"Track 4, train number 1411..."
For Bridolle.

Take your shoes off.
Make yourself comfortable.
The wine's inside of Rick.

You came just in time.
You saved my life.
"Well, look at you."
You're all dressed up.
Yeah.
We're in the money.
I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all.
I went right in and signed the names.
"- Oh, and the claim was-"
- Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.

Help!
What's wrong with you?
I thought you're the masked killer.
You're the biggest coward I've ever seen.
Dry the clothes!
Use both fingers.
Why?
It's a waste of effort.
This is our family secret.
Do it!
It's not practical.
Get it.
Who dropped these money?
Money?
It's mine!
I dropped it!
You dirtied my clothes!
I'll kill you.
You've got the wrong person!
- I'll get you.
- I'm innocent!
Where do you think you're going?
- Ah Foon.
- What?
"Look, we're friends."
I'm going to make you brave tonight.
How?
You mean...
It's not as bad as that.
Really?
"You know, we are a team today."
Jin.

You need to hurry.
You're falling behind you know that?
Yes.
Day 12
I've heard that people can stay up for 11 days.
This is day 12.
I've broken the world record.
Where no one has gone before.
This means more than a Cannes Lion award.
"We're born once, so we got to give it our all like this."
I think...
I've reached the apex of work now.
"If Peng could see me now, he would know I gave it my all."
My chest hurts.
It hurts badly.
Body.
Like this.
HE YELLS
"Oh, like that?"
Yeah.
"No, try another one."
No.
No.
No.
No.
You did that one already.
"I know, that's similar but more powerful."
"Try one more. ""Hap hap."""
"""Ninya!"""
Now you're just making up words.
"I'm not, that's Japanese for ""hello."""
It's not Japanese.
Kimaragnas!
She's going to be offended if you do that.
"Rey, hey, hey, hey...!"
I don't...
I don't think we should do the power moves in there.
HE YELLS Konichiwa!
Brilliant!
"OK, good, that's a Japanese word."
Yes.
And one that I'm sure she'll be impressed by.
Yes.
"Let's do this, O'Leary."
"Hello, Philip."
"Hakuna matata, sensei."
Senpai.
We are currently looking into the kidnap of Simon Cowell.
- [Klein On Radio] Got him.
Angie's parked over here in the LTD.
[Russo On Radio] Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"That car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night if we have to.
[Shouting]
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Horn Honks]
What time is it?
Ten after 4:00.
- Huh?
- Ten after 4:00.
That's the third time those guys have been around.
- All right.
Let's hit 'em!
Hit 'em!
- [Siren Wailing]
Freeze!
All right.
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
[Sirens Continue]
Get over...
Get over there!
Hey!
Get up there!
Spread those fucking legs!
Now stay right there!
"You move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off!"
- What the hell's that?
I'm going up.
Right.
"Oh, I'm coming now."
[Wind howling]
[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
Do what?
Somers.
Martin Somers.
"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.
What is it?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
- What is this here?
- Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"Of course, now, they refuse to go to bed on time..."
We would expect you to cook all the meals.
"Wash up, laundry-"
- That's in addition to the baby...
Mommy!
As well as I bought...
"No, no.... ...Mommy made a mistake, but Mrs. Singh is going to take good care of you."
Okay?
"Marva, it's time to say goodbye to your children--"
"No, no, no, no-- Please!"
Please!
Come honey--
Please-- Don't do this.
Come here.
NO!
Sean!
Mommy!
"I love you, I love you."
Let go of her!
Mommy!
"No, they're mine!"
Mommy!
Mommy!
Marva?
Marva!
Are you okay?
I'm so-
- I'm so sorry.
"Well, thank you--"
"Mrs. Field,"
"I promise, I'm not a flake."
I'm very good at sleep-training and I'm an excellent cook.

They have abandoned us!
SVEN:
Everybody!
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.

Detective Kelly.
"-Yeah. I remember you, detective."
KELLY:
Come here.
-Should I call Detective Roberts at home?
-You know this isn't cool.
"-Maybe Connie, his wife, will answer."
-You gotta do me a really big favor.
-What's that?
Mike promised to get me money.
I can't get in touch with him--
-That's not how this works.
"-But if I could borrow $20, I promise- l will give him your message."
-l gotta get up. I don't have any money.
-l'm gonna give him your message.
-No.
"No, no, no."
That's not good.
You think I'm only his snitch?
You think that's what I am?
I'm not.
I'm his round-the-world girl.
I'm his whore.
-What the hell's going on?
-You got a visitor.
"Hi, Mike."
-You're not supposed to be in here.

Impressive ...

"No, she."
"Ali, surrounded by children."
-That is your wife?
-Yes.
Really?

Go away!

I'm sorry.
I can't.
"I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home."
"This is our home, Jenna, and I'm..."
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
But I'm moving into Kenny's.

He said he was goin' into town to get some parts.
Smells good in here today.
Is that door locked?
You get to stay by my side.
I feel so privileged.
I'll get it.
"Now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up, and blow that whistle I gave you."
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello?
- Hi.
Is this a bad time?
No.
Just hold on a sec.
The music.
I'll be right back.
- Hey.
- You said that already.
I did.
You're right.
Sorry.
"- So, what's up?"
- Nothing.
- What about you?
- Same.
"So, what have you been doing?"
"Nothing much, just hanging out, in the park mostly."
- Central Park?
- Washington Square Park.
It's cooler.
It's where David Lee Roth got busted.
Right.
I hope he's got it together now.
Sounds like you got a party going on there.
"- No, it's just me and my mom."
"- ""Abanibi""."
"Right, by Yizhar Cohen."
I-bi lo-bove (I love you)
I-bi lo-bove you-bou...
- Don't you get it?
- What?
"The restaurant's called Yizar, Yizhar Cohen."
There's a restaurant named after Yizhar Cohen?
That explains the hair.
"It isn't a restaurant, it's a fan club."
For Yizhar Cohen?
Why?
Do you speak French?
You look surprised.
Haven't you heard of us?
- No.
- You see?
God knows where he sends us.
"On April 22, 1978, our king, Yizhar Cohen, won Eurovision."
157 points.
34 years ago in three weeks.
Israel is our mother and Yizhar is our king.
Cheers.
I'll serve you myself.
Eat hearty.
It's all kosher.
"- April 22, 1978."
- What?
That's Shai's birthday.
Why did we come here of all places and they're playing Mom's favorite song?
- She's sending us signs.
"- Yeah, in ""B"" Language"
"- Oh, I get it."
"You're celebrating already, huh?"
You ungrateful pieces of shit!
- He's okay.
He's okay.
- Unbelievable.
- What are you doing here?
- You're bloodsuckers.
All of you.
I hope your 401ks go straight to hell.
Victor.
"Whoa, whoa."
Hey.
"Come here, come here."
Calm down.
You're making a scene.
These aren't your employees.
"- Oh, wow."
You're right.
- Come on.
"Why did you do this to me, Truman?"
Why did you do it?
You think I don't see what's going on?
"I go to jail, and who benefits?"
You.
You prick.

"Sensei, sorry to trouble you."
We brought you quite a bit of trouble.
"Ah er, I have some good wine here, have a little."
"I am the team captain, Tezuka."
Captain?
- You're mistaken.
- Tezuka is a third year student.
Yo Tezuka-sensei.
Tezuka-sensei.
- But that o-chibi was quite good today.
"- Yes, he was."
- He scared me a little.
- Um.
"Ah, that was the Nitouryu."
That Nitouryu was not natural.
Not natural?
He learned from his father.
"His father, you said Echizen Nanjiro?"
- You're bothered because of this?
- Eh?
What do you mean?
What is it?
What?
"Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again."
"Oh, I'll never be doing that"
- again.
"But I did it, didn't I?"
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!
- You did.
Are you up?
"No, I'm here."
Can I come over?
What can I say?
- Thank you.
You saved me.
- So your apartment's ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
They did a great job.
It's better than it was before.
I should've burned it down long ago.
- Ok.
Ok.
- Ok.
"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.
- I lost the apartment.
- I know.
I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
"She will pay for that, I swear."
The phone.
We have to warn the Ministry.
(Telephone)
Hallo?
Too late.

Ah.
But I just broke up with Bill...
- Right. [clears throat] - ...and I got all this
"""Girls Are Funny, Too"" stuff happening..."
- Right.
- ...and Goldie's actually letting me do a rewrite of one of the sketches.
"Oh, wow."
Congratulations.
"Thank you, so it's just-- man, it's just-- it's really bad timing for me right now."
"Timing, right."
So...
is there any chance we could just be friends?
Of course.
[laughs]
"Yeah, yeah."
"- Okay, good."
"- Yeah, friends."
"- I'll see you later, friend."
- All right.
Oof.
Hey.
"Missed your time, Sull."
"By ten minutes, just put me up next."
- Sorry.
- Who's here?
Booked until 1:45.
"Oh, angel."
You're the best.
You're the best in the land.

- This is the very best.
The very best girl ever in the whole wide world.
"The prettiest, smartest, brightest,"

Oh!

How much?
How much?
How much will you give me for her?
"No, I'm just kidding."
I'm just kidding.
Have some fabric softener.
"Yes, indeed."
Ooh!
I'm gonna get a few of them.
"What, honey?"
What?
"What are you looking at, huh?"
What are you looking at?
Come on.
Come on.

And I started flipping out.
I was moving my foot and hitting my toes with my...
"Oh, that's disgusting."
Let's not talk about it.
Ugh.
Yeah?
"Brave kid, huh?"
"Yeah, brave or stupid."
One of the other.
"How's, uh, how's your proble?"
"He's all right, why?"
Just asking.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just asking.

"OK, got you."
"OK, OK, what's the nut on the"
"Game, man?"
"What do you want to do, like, 50 bucks a head?"

"Let's get it on, man."
"Yeah, let's get it on."

"No, you are."
Is that all you can think of?
"No, I couId say..."
"I,ve had enough."
You go out.
"You see people and have fun, while I,m stuck here alone."
Then you come home and get waited on.
Are you kidding now?
"Sure, I laugh all day long."
"And you cry too, right?"
What would you know?
Where's our mom?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.
Lukas will be alive.
"I'll make you both breakfast, put out your clothes."
"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.
Elias...
It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?
She's lying.
Let her prove she's our mom.
What am I doing?
What's Lukas doing?
But I can't see him!
What's he doing?
Elias...
Mom would know that.
Mom could see him.
She'd know what he's doing.
"No, Elias."
Don't!

"It's a little thick, honey."
"Ok, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?"
It's the way I talk.
"""Talk."" See?"
"That right there, ""talk."""
So what are you saying?
"After 7 years all of a sudden, my accent bothers you?"
It's not a question of it bothering me.
"I mean, look, are you smart?"
Sure.
Do you sound smart?
[Grunting]
O-ok.
"Um, so what else?"
Your laugh.
My laugh?
Yeah.
Ha!
"Well, I thought people think my laugh is fun."
"Yes, if you think loud, scary noises are fun."
O-ok.
So what else?
What else?
Nothing else.
Come on.
Tell me!
There's nothing else!

Inui is collecting data in real time because the power of the opponents exceeded the data that he had collected.
Game Hyotei.
Five games to two.
You're gonna be defeated.
"- Kaidou, can you still continue?"
- Watch carefully.
Thanks for the hard work.
"See, a straight shot."
I could've stopped him.
"Buzz, I would love to see you try."
"Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater."
"The sooner we move, the better."
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
All this packing makes me hungry.
"What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet?"
Pizza Planet?
"Oh, cool!"
"Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready."
-Can I bring some toys?
-You can bring one toy.
-Just one?
-One toy?
Will Andy pick me?
"""Don't count on it""?"
Buzz!
"Oh, Buzz!"
Buzz Lightyear.
"Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness."
We've got trouble!
-Trouble?
Where?
-Down there.
Just down there.
"A helpless toy, it's..."
"it's trapped, Buzz!"
Then we've no time to lose.
I don't see anything!
"Oh, he's there!"
"Just, just keep looking!"

I said I'm clean.
Get off!
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass!
Give me a nickel.

Nobody's holdin'.

Doesn't register.
"There's been some talk, though."

"Oh, definitely get a bottle."
Coffee for me.
"You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you."
Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.
"No, I mean, I've only got one good eye."
Could we change places?
"Oh, sure."
-Are you okay?
"-Oh, yes, yes."
Fine.
-This is a nice place.
-Yeah.
It's my favorite.
You ever come here with Charlie?

He's a big steak-eater.
I'm more of a fish guy.
"You know, I'm surf, he's turf."
And we're cops.
-You're very cute.
-You too.
All right.
So tell me about yourself.

"They're so crispy, and you add a little salt... (LAUGHS) I just think they're so delicious."
Ooh!

"You're a masterpiece, aren't ya?"
"You're like a Shelly Pfeiffer, you're like a Charlie Theron, or like a Penny Cruz."
Ooh!

Thanks.
Ugh.

I wish you to.
I desire it.
Oh... (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)

You cannot save someone in this place.
You can only replace them.
Do you desire this also?

What is it?
It is a...
There's a case I'm working on.
It's a murder.
And we've found something at the scene.
What?
It's blood but it's not the victim's.
We ran some DNA tests and there's a match.
"Mark, it's Jesse."
"The DNA, it's Jesse."
He's alive.
- So you're saying he's a murderer?
"- No, nobody is saying anything."

Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for coming with me today."
"Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to see Violet, and this gives us a chance to hang out."
Yeah.

"Things have been a little awkward, you know?"
"Well, no."
"It's just, uh..."
It's nice to see you... outside of the office.

THEY'VE GOT THE BACK COVERED.
"AAH, NOTHING."
JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WINDOWS OR DOORS

THE THING TO LOOK FOR IS AN AIR-CONDITIONER UNIT.
THAT'S WHERE THE WALL IS WEAKEST.
"ALSO, PEOPLE WATCH DOORS."
THEY DON'T WATCH AIR CONDITIONERS.

"- Soft hands, Jess."
"- Jess, come on, let's share it."
"- You know, work out a system."
- Hey.
"Hey, that's my shirt."
"- No, this is my T-shirt."

It has my name on it.
- Don't drop it.
"Jess, don't..."
"- Come on, everybody out now."
- Give me my shirt!
- I like this shirt.
"Hey, Jess, no, no, no, stop."
- Don't mind us.
We're just here for the TV.

-Eighty-five degrees.
-He's not warming up enough.

So let 'em wait.
Get rid of the cigar.

That was a new cigar.
You stay here.

Looks like the police!
Police?
Push him out!
- He won't squeal on us again!
- He'll slow down the cops.
I told you he'd be trouble.
"What was that, Karl?"
It's an awful road.
You can't see a thing.
- Who's there?
Imagine It!
"- Ah, Tonino!"
What did he do?
- Let's start with changing his undies!
"How cute, grandpa's little boy!"
"He needs a very hard name that nobody has, because if not.."
"A hard name like Antenore, for example."
No.

Look... ls that him?
Well now...
You're going to tell me all about this Herman.
I've known Herman for years.
From when I first met Johan.
Johan?
Who's this Johan?
- My dead husband I told you about.
"- Oh, yes."
"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.
Sure.
But tell me about this Herman?
I'd rather not.
If she comes looking for me and sees you then we got the screaming problem again.
"So, for now, would you, you know, just..."
"Just stay here, okay?"

"I know, just relax."
I can's feel an exit wound.
Shit.
"Crawford, I need you to give me the name of Latif's spy."
You saved your daughter's life.
"You have her, now tell me his name."
Are you interrogating him?
"Yes, I am!"
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up...
And there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it!
I am not crazy.
- Leave me.
"Let me go, you psycho."
I'm not..

You don't believe me.
Come here.

Hello.
Excuse me.
"Mrs Ransom, if I mentioned the name ""Dennis"" and the word ""blackmail"", would this mean anything to you?"
Yes?
Splendid.
"What I want to know is are you going to pay him, or are you going to fight?"
I don't know.

Good night.

"No, it's not."
Get up.
Good morning.

Would you please hurry up?
I'm almost ready.
All I need is my shoes.

"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
Excuse me.

Very good!
"Oh, what?"

"-No, you can't."
"-Yes, I can."
-You can't.
-Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!

She's dead?
Yes.
"All right, then."
Get out!
Get out of the car!
"Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot."
I got money.
I don't want your fucking money.
Help me get her in the car.

"Yeah, they keep us pretty busy."
I just came back from body-slam class.
Do they grade that pass-fail or is it on a curve?
There's a few things I would like to know--
"-Yeah, like, when's your first match?"

"Um, uh..."
"Don't mind her, Henry."
She's mourning her late husband.
I wasn't betting on seeing you again.
Your persistence is unparalleled.
And quite exciting.
Slick Dimitry's services were excellent.
I'm just glad I never paid upfront.

Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
What was the matter with you?
"I don't know, exactly... but..."
I need help.
Don't go any closer.
Why?
"What is it, Tony?"
"Tony, stop it!"
"Stop it, Tony, stop it!"

"Why are you doing this, Tony?"
Stop.

Where are we?
What's happened?
Tony.
"Tony, we can still do it."
We can still make use of molecular control.
"OK, doc, let's do it."
Letha!
"Why don't we all go and have some... some candy and, uh, sodas and ice cream?"
Next time...
- ...next time I'll...
- Forget it.
I've lost my faith in science.
Sickle!
"This is a club, not a boxing ring."
The cunt walked right into us.
- Where's your booze?
- So you beat him up?
- You let too many losers in.
- He owns three restaurants.
I'm spending 30 grand here tonight.
I can beat up anyone I want.
Have we finished?
Come on.
"Hey, T!"
Send up a couple of bottles.
"Fuck, man."
- Fucking Paki.
- We taught him good.
- Hi.
"- What's up, Hanne?"
I was wondering...
can I have a line?
Help yourself.
- I'm in the mood now.
- For what?
A fuck.
- Who says I am?
- You were just now.
That was then.
But if you want you can give me a hand job.
- OK.
Where shall we go?
- Do it right here.
- Here?
- Hey?
Is this enough?
- Plenty.
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.
- And for you?
- Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
"Well, okay."
Give me both.
- What time is it?
- Late.
Get up.
They gave us a car while they fix ours.
FAIR WAGES
I heard last night the girls wanted to leave town.
- People talk a lot when they drink.
- And go where?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy with them.
Rocio.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
"- No, thank you."
Smells good.
What is it?
- River crabs.
- Spicy?
- So what now?
- Which is their bedroom?
May I?
She brought me some milk.
There.
Do you want me to give you some?
"No, thank you kindly."
She brought it for you.
I think Farhad dug Biston on his own.
Do you know him?
Yes.
"He's a local, he lives three miles away."
A local?
Well done.
But it wasn't Farhad who dug Biston.
I know.
Who then?
It was love.
The love of Shirin.
Bravo.
You know love too.
A man without love cannot live.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Where are you going?
"As usual, we're going to eat strawberries."
- Where's Jahan?
"- Sleeping, as usual."
You'll bring him back?
"You know, he doesn't eat strawberries."
Who called?
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?
Greetings.
She wanted news.
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.

Neat vodka.
You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"

Four million.
It's a drop in the bucket for a guy like Marcus.
I think he wants me to fail.
Why?
I almost died in Berlin.

I got burned.
I think Marcus lost faith in me.
All he needs is an excuse to replace me.
Then he's a goddamn fool.

I called the house but nobody's there.
Nobody's answering.

Hold it!
Hold it!
Let me see that cut!
Stoker's through!
He's through!
How many more beatings do you have to take?
Better lay down.
Better than having your brains knocked out.

Lay down.

Let them fight!
What a switch!
Stoker gave him one under Nelson's chin!

To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.

"Say, why is this called The Floyd Diner instead of Floyd's Diner?"
"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?

Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
"After law school, I headed where?"
"Floyd, New York."
Washington.

- 26000.
- I expected it'd be more.
Thursdays are never that full.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She OD'ed on X.
The ambulance came.
- Which hospital?
- Bispebjerg.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Hello?
"Hi, mummy."
I'm in a bit of a rush.
"No, my birthday was yesterday."
"Yes, I'm sure."
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
What happened?
- Listen to me!
Yes!
- Listen!
Did you buy it from Pahadganj?
- Yes.
Its Khurana's goods.
- How did you know?
Only Khurana sells such cheap stuff.
Do you know?
"Saying Calvin Klein, he gives us Khurana's goods."
He is a miser!
Calvin Klein doesn't make..
.Such underwear.
How could you say that?
- You look good.
"Ma'am, I am telling you."
Don't say it in public.
This man!
Kills by giving electric shock.
During power cuts he kills by using the generator.
You don't cry.
Ask him.
Shall I tell him what happened on Sunday?
This Sunday or previous Sunday?
Fool!
You!
- Sorry!
Sorry!
Say it clearly!
Pinto!
Pinto!
Gil-Ga...
Gil?
Gil Da Ran?
Da Ran...
Did your wedding get called off?
He said with his own lips that he wasn't my brother-in-law!
Is that why he's not answering my phone calls?
That's because...
Yoon Jae has a situation right now.
He even insulted me!
Stupid!
He pretended he didn't know me.
He totally dissed dad!
-That wasn't Yoon Jae who did that...!
-Then...
Then who is the person I saw earlier?
And who's the one that acted like he didn't know me?
That was Yoon Jae.
"It's over, it's over."
It's over.
Oh my!
"It's our son-in-law, Yoon Jae!"
Did you eat the dumplings?
Do you know what was inside those?
Huh?
Try to guess.
-Meat?
-No...
-Shrimp?
-No!
"Here, watch."
"It wriggles around, and when you catch it, it escapes."
How's Tetty?
Be careful.
"Let's find those parts, okay?"
Okay!
We're going.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
You mean your Mom will...
Thanks for having us.
Um...
It's kinda dark.
I'll walk you home.
Really?
Don't bother.
She lives near me.
"Misaki, let's go!"
"Okay, I'll come back soon."
"Bye, Tetty."
See ya.
An unexpected rival appears...
His chances are good.
Yusuki is on the defensive...
Get lost!
"Ooh, I'm scared."
Why get in the way?
"They're so soppy, it makes me puke."
Really?
Really what?
What're you saying?
Don't you like her as well?
"Childhood friends, blossoming into more..."
No way!
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.
She is really talented.
Turn this off!
"Hey, turn it off!"
I cannot believe you!
That's the girl that
I am dating!
How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?
!
"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.
"Your photos, your movies, your website... it's all blocked."
Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.
Ben?
What are you doing here?
You go.
"Sadhana, go!"
"Vikram, he..."
Turn the car back!
This is Varun.
- How many times do I call you!
Where are they?
- I'm not able to track either of their numbers.
Both numbers are switched off.
- Okay.
Track my number.
- Your number?
Your number?
Why are you talking nonsense?
I said 'track my number.'
Did you?
Yes.
On Perundurai road...
It is showing some location off the main road
You are moving in the right direction.
"Priya, what happened?"
Vikram!
- Why has he stopped the car?
I don't know.
- Where are we?
I've have no clue.
- Priya!
Priya!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
- Leave her!
"Priya, where are you?"
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
-John.
"-Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"Tell me, does Mr. Bourne still drop in?"
"Not quite as often, but often."
"Let me know if he comes in, will you?"
"Oh, there you are, Alec."
-I thought you had to make a phone call.
"-I did, darling."
Nobody home.
I was just asking John about my compact.
"-You remember, I lost it last night."
"-No, I don't remember."
I think the reward will help.
"It's square and gold-ribbed, isn't it?"
That's it.
"Be an angel, John."
Do your best for me.
"Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"All right, darling, I'm all yours."
"-Good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
"Well, good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-John.
-A table?
"No, I'll go to the bar, John."
"Oh, Mr. Bourne, Miss Lorrison asked about you."
Isabel Lorrison?
I didn't know she was in town.
She's in the Candle Room with Mr. Dawning.
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
Maybe it's the bars D‎.
You've also eaten the bars D‎?
‎
- I know that smell well‎. ‎
- I like sweets‎.
"Well‎, but do you know what‎?"
No smell sweet‎.
You better get your sack arrimas farts and sleep tonight‎.
Not more servings K ‎.‎.‎.
And no more bars D‎!
‎
- He's right‎. ‎
- Yes‎?
So have the end of my finger‎.
Removes insurance‎.
¡Barlow‎!
"The Helcats weigh about 35‎,000 pounds‎."
Sure you can cross out there‎.
That way baby will all Helcats‎.
Agreed‎.
Thank you‎.
"Well‎, Max‎."
Can I sell you a bottle of drink‎?
You sure‎.
‎
- Are 25 cents‎. ‎
- What‎?
‎
- Are 10 cents in the CP‎. ‎
- Out here ‎.‎.‎.
Are 25 cents‎.
Do not think they're following us‎.
You understand me?
Everything is going to be okay.
"Wes, let me out I feel sick."
You're okay?
"Stay with dad, okay?"
"Stay with him, understand?"
Promise me you'll take care of him.
"Alright boys, come on."

Six months at Rollins.
"Sheriff Armstrong said if you cooperate, he might consider..."
- I was the only one.
- Don't bullshit me.
- I don't rat out my crew.
- Look at me.
You almost dragged your brother into all this.
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.

Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)

Come on.
Huh?
What are you?

Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
Here-- it's not much-- a couple of hundred.
Why don't you take?
- Take it.
- It's okay.
"It's okay, man."
I'll figure it out.
Mickey!
Hey... remember when you were talking about moving downtown?
- Carlos:
Um-hmm.
- Maggie:
Maybe we should do that.
- Say what?
"- I mean, after Eddie gets better,"
- and things straighten out with Sean.
- That could take some time.
"- We're like a team, right?"
- Yeah.
Like Paul and Belkis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About me?
"What, Darlene?"
You learned that word yesterday?
"Fuck you, Darlene, all right?"
"- What's up, Angel?"
- Pon la luz aquí también.
- Deja la luz.
"- This bitch, bro'."
Trying to convince me she wasn't with some other nigga--
- Can't this wait until later?
"- No, it can't wait!"
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
We were scared and miserable and we took it out on each other.
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
But you suffer through that and it gets better.
I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that.
You or Barry.
Nothing is gonna get better for me.
Not ever.

He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."

"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.

Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."

"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!

Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."

- Fitzgerald.
- Mr. Perkins.
"There you are, my boy."
Have a seat.
[clears throat]
"Thank you for, uh..."
for seeing me.
"So, I've given it a read."
It's longer.

"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.

I've never met a woman like you... ever.

"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.

"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.

How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."

Cartridges?
"Certainly, sir."
Any particular make?
"No, as long as they've got gunpowder in them."

"A few rabbits, pheasants, small fry, you know."
"No, no, sir."
Bore.

Er...
"Definitely, yes."
"Well, which, sir?"
"Well, the largest you have, surely."
12-bore.
"How many, sir?"
50?
"No, I think you'd better make it a thousand."
- A thousand?
!
- Yes.
But didn't you say a day's rough shooting?
"Yes, I did, er..."
and it may be pretty rough.
"On second thoughts, I think you'd better make it 1,500, perhaps?"
Right.

The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
"Oh, its not making them."
It's getting them.
"This isn't a personal answering service, you know."
You mean I got a personal call?
There are three messages here from a Melinda.
See that?
I knew it.
I knew she'd call me once she saw me.
"No, no."
They're not for Poncherello.
They're for Baker.

"How soon can you get me Operator 19, St. Louis?"
That's my girl.
"Hi, Al."
This is Rip.
"Sure, I'm great."
Did you get my phone message this morning?
Not yet.
Not f or a while.
I got unfinished business down here first.
Somebody who used to be your Detroit competition.
Calls himself Martinelli.
"Yeah, in spades."
Did you dig me up the name of a good man down here?
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
"Okay, pal."
You're a pal.
I'll be seeing you.
"Yeah, when I got aces back to back."
So long.
Lieutenant Kincaid?
Call f or Lieutenant Kincaid.
- Calling Lieutenant--
"- Okay, boy."
Who wants me?
"Headquarters, sir."
On the phone.
"Hello, lieutenant?"
Chief wants to talk to you.
Will you hold the wire?
At last.
You said 1:00.
He can not get away from us.
There is the informer!
I can see him.
Yes.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
- Here they come.
- We necks him inside the toilet.
"You bastard, Wagner."
Now necks we need you!
"Stand still, Frank Wagner!"
Moving on!
Moving on!
Come on!
Hey!
Back!

Let him kill the pig!
Could not have waited a little longer?

Hands over your head!
"Frank, I'm out on seven to eight years."
"It's quiet tonight, huh, Freddy?"
Hmm?
It's quiet.
Everyone's at that bachelor party across the river.
"Oh, yeah."
Whoop-de-doo.
You got any quarters?
"Don't look at me, I just put two more in the meter."
- It's his birthday.
"- [ Figgis ] Oh,yeah?"
- He's going for high score.
"- Happy birthday, Freddy."
Happy Birthday.
Let me see what I got.
I wasn't into making a big deal after the ten-year thing.
"Hey, hey, how you doin'?"
"Sorry, Freddy."
Hey.
"[ Figgis ] I was wondering if you'd be able to, uh, come by."
Yeah. 4 Aces.
Where else?
Shit!
Damn it.
Two kinds of people in this world.
Pinball people and video game people.
"You, Freddy, you're pinball people."
"Always got somethin' to say, Figgsy."
Come on.
"Freddy, Freddy, Freddy."
Freddy!

Two weeks.
Two months?
Connor.
"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"
Blair?
"Blair, Blair."
Hello?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
"Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair."
Shit.
Just stick to the plan.
Just stick to the plan.
"Yeah, we'll stick to the plan."
We're good.
We'll just ah...
Where'd he go?
Where is that bastard?
"Hey, man!"
Get down here.
Do you see him?
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-go!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.
Let's go down.
I gotta save my little girl.
- We'll get him.
"- I've gotta find him, and save my baby."
"- Don't worry, we will."
- Okay?
"Get your act together, man."
We gotta save her.
"I know, man."
I know.
I have to save my daughter...
"Come on, man."
I have to catch that bastard.
"Don't cry, man."
"Dammit, Jong-go!"
- (Wife)
"- Please, pick up."
Shit!
"I love you, too."
Where's Nick?
He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
"Sime, what do they say about the weather?"
I believe we can expect bora wind.
But I already missed last time.
Lebicada will start blowing.
You can expect 3-5 on Bofor scale.
"Mist in the morning, it'll go away in the afternoon."
You should sail away as late as possible.
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day?
Are you out of your mind?
"I told you, now it's up to you."
"Put this piece there, too."
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day...
"- I'll be off, Stef."
Bye.
- See you.
Come and get it!
We've got nice salad!
"- Here I am, Ivka, Mirta."
"- Hi there, Sime!"
Bills for you...
- Do you have something for me?
- A letter.
- Wait!
Take this.
- There's no need.
- Thank you.
Bye!
- Bye.
"- Hey, Tesla!"
"- Hi there, Sime."
- I've got a letter for you.
- Thank you.
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
You like animals?
They're a lot nicer than people.
"So tonight, I'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter."
"Hmm, kinky."
[GIGGLES]
And the midnight screening of I Spit on Your Grave at the Cinedome.
AMANDA:
Unh.
I can't.
I have a curfew at 11.
So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
"Mm-hm, when's your curfew?"
I don't have one.
[CHUCKLES]
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
"Hmm, for how long?"
Couple of weeks.
[CHUCKLES]
Seriously?
"Yeah, we've got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
Unh.
-The motel?
-Mm-hm.
"HBO, Magic Fingers, free ice, it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.
"I do whatever I want, whenever I want."
- Hey.
- Dad!
"- Hey, pal."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mind if I use your bathroom?
I've got to make a pit stop.
Not a full pit stop-- just an oil change.
I'm going to pee.
So do you like the zipper bags better than the pinchy kind?
We don't have to do the small talk.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Okay.
"Buddy, put your backpack on."
"Okay, have a good day at school."
"I'll call you tonight to tell you that I love you and to say good night, okay?"
"Okay, Mom."
I love you.
"Oh, that is so sweet."
Reminds me of my mom.
Not that you're as old as my mom.
My mom is young.
She looks great.
You look great.
- We're going to go wait in the car.
"- Great, great, great."
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.

Oh.
That's funny.

Rance.

I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.

I want a partner.

"Yes, I do."
"Oh, no, did you tell him that you know?"
"Yeah, but I told him, uh, Dylan's dad told me."
Oh.
Thank you.
"No, thank you for telling me."
You did the right thing.
And I just wanted to let you know you don't need to come over.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Thanks.

Hi!

Marijuana.

We haven't said she can go out with you yet.

Can Henry not talk?
"No, you..."
You can't.
No.
"Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here might have built you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
Nice to meet you Timothy.
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Why?
Because I don't.
What was it?
"""What happens to the Good and Evil"
"""on Judgement Day?"""
That's obvious.
The Good go to hell and the Evil to heaven.
- ls that right?
- Yes.
No.
"The Good go to heaven, the Evil go to hell."
"Hurry in and write that, then come back."
Off you go.
Help yourself to tea if you want.

I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
Breathe.
Melitta!
"Melitta, breathe."
"Melitta, breathe!"
No!

"Well, it's late."

Opposite.

- Let me in!
- You'll have to come back.
"- Let me in, or I'll bash this door..."
"If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police!"
That's him!
There he goes!
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!
Help!

- Good night.
- Sorry your young man was detained.

Everything.
Wait!

Wait for me!

The movies?
I have free tickets.
From that weird guy?
"He works there, doesn't he?"
Weird?
"He looks a bit strange, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Did you talk to him?
A bit.
At least he gave you free tickets.
Right.
So do you want to come?
I can't.
Marco's coming.
"You don't like Marco, do you?"
"Yes, I do."
It's just that...
I don't really understand what he wants.
From me?
No... just generally.
"Sometimes I don't know, either... if he's honest."
"Yeah, I skated away and called you a big baby."
"Sophie threw a rock at me and you yelled, ""you're so gay."""
I did do that.
"Oh, didn't I?"
We used to use that word a lot.
You used to be able to call anything gay.
Ugh.
Do you ever miss that?
- No.
- No.
That's hurtful.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, Mitchell."
"You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was..."
I was not a good big sister.

Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."
"Go, move."
"Chin, go, go, go."
I got you covered.
Stay down.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Craig?
I wanna see him.
Please?
Dana.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."
- That's good.
- Bad news is you lost Mary.
"Sorry, she confused me with a Jedi mind trick."
- You want me to put out an APB?
- No.
I think I know where she is.
What's that?
Lunch.
Open it or he dies!

"- You""re right."
"She""s not perfect."
"They can""t all be perfect, Clara."
"- I guess I""ll meet her next week then."
"- That""s right."
Your internship starts.

"She doesn""t have to work."
"You, young lady, do not listen to your daddy."
You are going to go to band camp.
"L""ll write you a check."
"Writing checks, the answers to everything."
"Thanks, Clara, but this summer I thought I""d stick around here... pitch in, be with you guys."
"Besides, I really want to be an orthodontist."
Yeah?
Jeez!
"Okay, that""s it."
"It""s bath time."
Come on.
- You need some help?
"- No, honey, I""ll get it."
I got it.
David?
"Honey, I need you."
"Can you give me J.T.""s blanky?"
"- Hey, Boo Boo."
- Hey.
"I guess Clara""s sleeping with the boys again?"
"That""s good, you know."
Boys being so close to their mom.
"Yeah, I think so."

"Just shout Fat Pig, that'll do."
Bye-bye!
Fat Pig?
"Hi Fat Pig, long time no see, you're keeping well!"
You're making a lot of money!
"Let me down, Fat Pig!"
How dare you call me Fat Pig?
Only my mom calls me this!
His mom!

Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?

Who was it?
Who was it?

I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.

It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.

I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.

God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.

It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.

Nothin' to be nervous about.
Just a little routine inspection.
Then we can all go back to our business.
Hello.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
"Divergent,"
-10%.
-Hmm.
Shit.
"(SINGING IN ARABIC) Jacoub, put your weapon down."
Put your weapon down.
(JACOUB CONTINUES SINGING)
"Oh, for Christ's sake..."
"No, no that's good, it'll frighten the life out of them, if they hear us all singing."
"Everyone, sing."
Nice and loud.
Come on!

"Go, go!"

(CLARE GASPING)
They wanted us dead.
They weren't fucking government forces!
"I told you, Matak had us marked."
"Najim, outstanding, back of the net with that one."
"Oh, we're celebrating killing people, are we?"
Is everyone all right?
Dad?
Najim?
You all right?
"Yeah, he's good."
We're all fine.
(LAUGHING)
Except me...
I've been shot.
(VEHICLE SLOWS TO STOP)
And for the first time in Paradise City!
!
they will wrestle in a ring filled with fish!
Fresh fish!
Thank you!
- Red!
- Yeah?
- Where's section C?
"- Oh, it's right over there!"
"Right over here, I've got delicious, piping-hot Coney Island red hots!"
"Anybody else, now?"
"Folks, get your red-hot peanuts!"
Five cents a bag!
"Here you are, folks!"
- 2!
5- to-1 on Nelson!
- Will you pass that?
I'll lay you 3-to-1 !
"- Three-to-one, huh?"
- That's right!
"Well, I don't know!"
- What do you want?
- I've seen these guys fight!
"Three-to-one, and I'll give you the draw!"
Here comes Nelson!
"Here he comes, Little Boy!"
Sit down!
You're making too much noise!
"Okay, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Bunny!"
How are you?
SERIOUSLY.
LUCY.
LUCY.
[ SIGHS ] FINE.
GET YOUR DOCUMENTS TOGETHER.
I'LL HAVE MY GUYS DO AN I.D. PACKAGE.
GO SEE EVELYN FIRST.
THANKS.
I SEPARATED FROM DOUG A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I TRIED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR JASPER'S SAKE.
THAT'S OUR SON.
BUT IT WAS HARD ON HIM LISTENING TO US FIGHT ALL THE TIME.
"HE STARTED ACTING UP AT SCHOOL, AND THEN DOUG TURNED ON HIM,"
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.
I'M SURE YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
HE TOOK HIM.
"HE PICKED HIM UP EARLY AT SCHOOL ONE DAY, AND HE DISAPPEARED."
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
"YEAH, EVERY DAY."
"BUT TECHNICALLY WE'RE STILL MARRIED,"
AND HE'S JASPER'S FATHER.
"SO WITHOUT A CUSTODY ORDER, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING."
"PLEASE, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO SORT THIS OUT."
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM?
NONE.
"I HAVE NO IDEA, BECAUSE I'VE HARDLY SPOKEN TO HIM IN MONTHS."
DO YOU HAVE PICTURES?
YEAH.
"HERE, THAT'S JASPER."
PLEASE.
LUCY SAID YOU COULD FIND HIM.
I NEED TO KNOW THAT HE'S OKAY.
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."
Hi.
Ashley. (CLICKS TONGUE)
"Oh, my God."
Hi.
- Josh.
- Josh.
Yeah.
- Wow.
How are you?
- I'm good.
How you doin'?
It was...
- Beth's wedding?
"- Beth's wedding, right."
Wow.
Was a fun night.
I'm foggy.
- Good to see you.
"- Yeah, nice to see you as well."
You guys know each other.
"Yeah, we fucking live together."
(CLICKS TONGUE) Nice.
"How you take a punch, Josh?"
- (COUGHS) Excuse me?
- I think we should get into a fight.
For the article.
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
Come to the front desk.
Yes or no?
We're here.
"Fine, we don't have to."
You're leaving?
Not like I'm desperate for girls.
Nice shot.
You suck.
Watch and learn.
"""Hello dear I have to work overnight"""
"""so please take Miki to day care tomorrow."""
Hey.
Feel how hard I am.
Your room's ready.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Here.
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, and this too."
What's wrong?
The cleaning lady...
She looks familiar.
"She's not your neighbor, is she?"
"If she is, we're in trouble."
"Darn, where have I seen her?"
What if we're caught?
"Hey, hey..."
I don't care anymore.
"So you can't pay up, huh?"
Maybe call the police.
She doesn't even have an ID on her.
She can't pay.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
We've found the medal.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
What?
Wait.
"Oh, what, you want a photograph?"
Thank you.
That's not what I had in mind.
What?
"Just hang on a second, will you?"
Hello.
What is it?
Uh...
Hm.
What's that?
That's neat.
Neat?
Yeah.
Huh.
At last.
"At last, it's wonderful."
Let's get out of here.
All in good time.
I must take a closer look at this ingenious...device.
Absolutely marvelous workmanship.
Fiendishly clever.
"Eh, what sort of trap do you suppose it sets off?"
No.
Hey.
"I'll entertain any ideas, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
You don't know me!
Dunston-
- Your mother's work number is just ringing.
Do you have another number for her?
That's all we got.
Sorry--
"I talked to her at lunch, maybe she just--"
Ow!
What you think they're gonna do when they find out mom works outta state?
Think!
Ow!
You don't have to pinch so hard!
Office?
"Oh hi, Mrs. Ray."
Mr. Dunston-
- I'm ready to hear your side of the story--
"Mr. Ray, your wife is on Line 1."
Not now--
She said it was urgent.
Tonight...
"It's you, beyotch."
One more thing--
"Can you sign there, please?"
♪
WHACK!
Dunston!
"You know, but right after that..."
Things became real clear.
"You fight, or be killed."
Dunston--
I started hustling shortly after that.
And here I am.
-Your way!
-Make your way
"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.
-Erik.
-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
Taylor.
They abolished slavery.
"Excellent, excellent."
Liam.
There were no executions.
"Yes, that's true."
Joanna.
Men and women were treated as equals.
"That's right, that's right."
"At the back, Sam."
"They believed in peace, not war."
Absolutely right.
"Now can you tell me, what was the Treasure of Atlantis?"
Knowledge.
I can't hear you.
Knowledge.
I still can't hear you.
Knowledge!
Absolutely correct.
Knowledge.
You are all my brightest students.
"All right, come here."
Stand right here.
There.
Tell me you don't hear it.
I don't hear it.
Wait a second.
"Okay, now."
You don't hear that?
I don't hear it.
It's humming.
But I need you outthere.
Itwon't be like the last time.
The war's crippled the Democrats.
I can win.
We deserve it.
"It's ours, Buddy, at last."
Nobody knows that betterthan you.
Frank Nixon's boy.
Do you remember what Mom said?
"""We're not like other people."
We...
"We don'tchoose ourway."""
"We can really change things, Buddy."
We got a chance to get it right.
We can change America.
"Itwas our dream, Buddy, together, always."
"- Do you really wantthis, Dick?"
- Yeah.
"This, above all."
- And then you'll be happy?
"- Yeah, you know I will."
Yes!
I will.
Yeah.
Then I'll be there foryou.
And we are gonna win this time.
I can feel it.
Yeah!
[Laughing]
"You're the strongestwoman I evermet, Buddy."
- Can ljustask for one thing?
- Anything.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Wags, not too far behind with five."
"This time, I'm looking for two answers to get the points."
"Wags, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
I can see femur there...
But I can't see leg...
Thigh...
Thigh...
Femur...
"No, there's no thigh."
"So, er, clavicle..."
Three points now.
Shoulder is there.
Shoulder.
Shoulder and...
What's the...?
Scapula!
Yeah.
Your answers?
It's shoulder and scapula.
Show me your first letters.
For two points...
"Scapula and shoulder, very well done, excellent."
"Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
What have we got?
Minerva and Athena?
"Are they there, though?"
Minerva and...
"Oh, where's Athena?"
Athena...
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.
- Further your people skills!
Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.
"- Troy, it's for you!"
- It can't be.
- It is.
It's for you!
- I don't get calls.
"Well, you're getting this one."
It's Donna.
Your wife.
Oh.
"Hiya, Donna."
- How's the wife?
- She wants me to move back in with her.
Oh.
"- D'you fancy it, or?"
- Aye.
Suppose.
- Best pack me bag.
- Yeah.
Suppose you best had.
Yes!
See me after the show.
I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.
- I'll come along.
- Stay here!
"Ah Foon, but..."
But what?
You think I'll die?
What are we?
- Friends.
- Right.
Take revenge if I die.
What are you doing?
This is my family charm.
Take it.
Superstitious!
Wait for me!
Go to hell!
Mr. Chiu!
Substitution!
Help yourself!
Ah.
A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on... and supposedly kissed another guy.
"On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school."
How could she?
Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.
Dumping?!
That doesn't make sense.
With a completely old looking sunbae.
"Ah, that girl!"
Really!
"Oh, look here!"
If you just leave like this...
Unnie!
Seung Jo came.
He came.
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it.
- He doesn't.
Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.
Ha Ni to Kyung Sunbae...
Kiss?!
"That's right, a kiss."
Oh Ha Ni is really great.
"She even said to him ""Can you do it one more time?""."
"Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?"
What do you mean?
Oh Ha Ni dumped him.
Dumped?
What is it you want to say?
"Hae Ra, I..."
It's fine.
I'll just leave for today.
"But, Hae Ra..."

Just detach the scope module.
Yeah.
Wow.
"Yeah, I would look so cool walking around,"
listening to my iPod with this fucking thing on my head!
"It also advertises that,"
"""Parents will love what they don't hear""."
"It says ""While the LaserScope surrounds the player with the sounds of exciting gameplay action,"""
"""non-players can listen to music, read a book, talk on the phone,"""
"""or have a conversation in the same room""."
Yeah.
"While you're saying,"
"""Fire!"
Get out!

Don't you understand?
It's Act of God.
"You want money, don't you?"
Go and ask God.
Take him away.
Act of God.
Just a second.
Just a second.
Leave me.
Act of God.
"So, you believe in God."
- Yes.
You believe that God is present everywhere.
"ln him, him, that madam, him."
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.
And me?
"Mr. Dinesh, you believe that God dwells in me too."
Yes.
Thank you.
Act of God.
I didn't do it.
God did.
It's 'Act of God'.
God slapped him again.
I didn't do it.
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.
"Later, will your family get the claim.. ..or will that be 'Act of God' as well?"
"How nice to see you, Georgia."
I was just picking up some onions for my mum.
"Well, you know your onions, don't you, Jas?"
You've been eating organic food for ages.
Cool.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"This is my friend, Georgia."
- I'm Jas.
"- Hi, I'm Tom."
Do you need something for a sore throat?
"- So, what school are you two at?"
- Ridgley.
Ridgley?
"Me, too."
Just started.

That's all right.
Can't let my brother work hard serving good looking girls without a cup of tea.
Sorry?
- Apples.
She likes apples.

"About a pound, yeah?"
"Robbie, this is Jas and Georgia."
They go to Ridgley too.
Okay.
"Yeah, I thought I recognised them."
"Tom, I got to move."
I got band practice.
- You're in a band.
"- Yeah, some mates from London."
Kanji.
- Yes.
How will you fight the case?
That's simple.
"lf your Lord can appear in the temple.. ..from 9-12 and 4-7, then he's free from 12-4."
He can appear in the court at that time.
What do you need?
Tell me.
"Agreement, affidavit, anything you need."
I will make it.
Come with me.
I've high contacts.
Just tell me what you need?
High contacts?
- Yes.
I want to send a notice.
- Come with me.
Come on.
"So, who do you want to serve the notice to?"
'Bhagwan' (God).
"So, Mr. Bhagwan"
Surname?
Surname?
He must have a last name?
"Sharma, Verma, Kapoor, Khanna, Desai, anything."
"Don't know, because we haven't met."
I see.
No.
- You two haven't met?
No.
- That's fine.
What's his crime?
It's been sabotaged.
Someone did this on purpose.
(Footsteps in the distance)
James:
That could be her!
Connor:
"James, stop!"

"(Monster continues growling, gurgling and struggling)"
Amy:
If they're all like that we're screwed!
Amy:

I was afraid of this and it happened.
Few of my men have accompanied me.
Send them upstairs.
I'll manage the rest.
"- Okay, sir."
"Sir, he took those tablets again... ...that doctor had warned him not to take."
"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
"It'll be like, something that he'll do [INAUDlBLE]."
TED LEO:
And then I will have to kill him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That's your thing.
BETH HOYT:
"Not that we know if that happens, you know."
It wasn't said here.
"Next comment from YouTube, this is"
"Cee-Lo, String, or Prince."
TED LEO:
"Well, obviously you want to bone Sting because he's all that, the Tantric stuff, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You have a week to spare?
TED LEO:
Exactly.
"Yeah, maybe you don't want to bone Sting, actually."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You do not want to bone String.
TED LEO:
Lose your job.
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, exactly."
TED LEO:
You'd be evicted while you were having sex.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You'd miss so many meals.
I'd kill Sting.
"Exactly, where's the food?"
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I'll wait outside.
- I love you!
- Are going to cry now?
Lower the seat some!
Are those brats following us?
It looks like the car from the errands center from last time.
What.
Hey.
Wait for me
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
- I think my husband might have put a tail on me.
- No.
It's my husband.
Drives me nuts.
- Hey!
This isn't gonna work.
"You, get off here!"
- Here?
There aren't even any buses.
"Get out,Hurry."
"If we get caught together, we're dead."
- How can I get out in this speed?
- Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"- Uh, no!"
"- Get out, you dick head!"
"Slower, slower."
Get out.
"Yeah, you moron."
I knew it.
You did put a tail on me.
"Yeah, and it wasn't us!"
This couldn't happen from the control room.
Connor:
No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.
Connor:
The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.
Kate:
I...
I don't like it down here.
James:
It's not too far.
(Distant scream)
Amy:
What the hell was that?!
Kate:
Probably a steam valve or something... right?
James:
Probably.
Kate:
How much further is it?
James:
It's not far.
Matt: ...Great.
Matt:
Just as i was starting to get freaked out.
James:
"Look, I'm sorry."
I thought that...
Matt (Interrupting):
Do you know where we're going or don't you?
Amy:
Matt...
I don't get it.
I just don't.

What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"
Your Grace.
We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
"Okay, I'm done."
It's yours.
Your folks...
Hello.
"Kerim, we've arrived but we don't know where to go."

You've just passed out.
Calm down.
Don't be afraid.
Is your foot too bad?
Where are they?
What's happening over there?
Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack:
Is that a rip? man:
"Why don't you film down there, Jack?"
Let's see if we see a cup.
"Come on, that's it."
Jesus.

You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack:
Yeah.

Where did he go?
- I am here.
Why do you always do this?
- Did someone fall again?
"Not there, he fell here."
"I offer a chair, and you make him fall."

But he is good at his work.
Hello.

It improves your life.
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
"And it probably would improve your posture to be with him, too."
I feel like you would just
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Sure.
"And you kill Pierce Brosnan because, did you see ""Mama"
"Mia?"""
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, that's exactly why."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
There need to be consequences.
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
He needs to pay for that.
And we're going to make him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Someone does.
BETH HOYT:
You guys got it?

You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."

Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it ?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
"Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it."
"When I say it, I want it to be more than words."

It's very good.
Have some.
No.

Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:

Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.
Kate:
I insisted.
Dont you hear?
Go.

What makes you happiest in life?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"Oh, yeah."
I love to swim.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Is that it?
Just swimming?
TlLDA SWlNTON:

TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It was a puppetry exhibition I've been curating with small bones of crows I've killed, and the fat boy down the street."
I borrowed it from Amy.
Kate:
"Yep, sure."
Matt:
That's a pretty deep film for a lowly engineer like yourself.
James:

Kate:
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:

James:
So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.
James:
And then we collide them... here.
James:
And then we detect what's made in the collision.

You seem to be in trouble.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.

Alright.

"-What do you mean, ""we""?"
"-Oh, dude, I just got an awesome idea."
Maybe we should--
-Haunt people so we can charge 'em a bunch of money to get rid of me so we can get super rich?
-Ghosts can read minds?
"Honey, could you turn that down?"
WHOA!
Dammit!

Oh yeah!
I didn't want to trip on them.
Ow!

Just a minute.
Oh!
"Hi, Marla."
We need to talk.
Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.

Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
"I'm behind, but I'm thinking, ""You know,"
"I can lash pretty good, and I can lash fast."
"I'm going to catch up."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Here he comes, Rob."
Here he comes.
Paul finally made it.
Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" Done."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.
You got this.
Aw!
Paul:
I got one more to go.
For the middle of nowhere.
You ready?
Come on.
Hey there.
"Hey, we're looking for, um,"
Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you?
"That's ok, we can come back."
"I'm sorry, but you look so familiar."
"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.

India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!
Sleep!
Shyamaprasad Shrivastava!
Who's he?
I don't know.
But he wants to see you.
Send him in.
- Okay.
Hello!
Hello!
You have to jump!
Twilight:
I'll never make it!
Pinkie Pie:
You'll be fine!
Twilight:
I will not!
(hydra roars)
Pinkie Pie:
I-i-i-t's your only ho-o-o-o-pe!
(hydra snarls) Pinkie Pie:
You have to take a leap of faith!
(Twilight gulps)
(hydra snarls)
(crash) (Twilight yelps)
No!
Oh no!
NOOOOOO!
(bubble pops) (Twilight screams) (Twilight grunts repeatedly)
(Twilight shakes off confusion) (ponies cheer) Pinkie Pie:
"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:
Huh?
Spike:
What wasn't what?
"Father, I think the water pressure was low."
So..
Father.
Father.
You're fool.
"That's a nice kurta, Kishen."
"Kundan, please leave me alone."
"Bhikhu, take his kurta off."
- Will I do all the work?
"No, Kundan, let me go."
Don't tear my clothes.
Mala's gang is here.
We'll deal with you later.
"Bhikhu, let's go."
Mala.
Are you fine?
Are you fine?
Those children stepped on me.
Who are you?
- I will tell you later.
Bye.
Mother is coming.
- Mother?

Just one idol left!

I can't believe you're coming with us.
The children are so happy.
She thinks you are crazy.

Where is he?
- A dozen of pot-bellied Ganesh idols.
- What!
Those Krishnas worth 250.
Eight of those brawny Hanumans.
- What are you saying?
- And five of those 'Sherawali'.
The lady sitting on the tiger.
What's the total?
"Three dozen, sir."
"- Three dozen, right!"
"Then, three Sai Babas bonus."
- What?
They are in a big demand.
Send it to the white Volvo parked there.
"- Okay. "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
What did you give him?
Give me too.
"- Funny, people are distributing alcohol like offerings.."
What's that?
What should I say?
Someone else gave my mouth a six and one third.
What's wrong with my mouth?
"God, I'm having a nervy B."
We've only gone over the plan a gazillion times.
You don't need to have a breakdown.
Just stick to your lines and we'll be fine.
Okay.
How's my hair?
Very Keira Knightley.
"Just get in there, you minger."
"Remember, lower your voice so you sound sexier."
Okay.
"- Hi there, how are you?"
"- Oh, fine, thanks."
- Can I get some onions please?
- Onions.
Red ones?
- Yeah.
- How many?
"Just a pound, please."
- A pound.
- Yeah.
"- These are nice ones, these are."
- Great.
What are you doing?
Jas?
"Hey, Jas."
Quelle surprise.
What a shock to see you here.
I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.
- The ocean!
- Really?
-You'll be back by nightfall.
Which ocean?
A tumbling open Ocean
We need to be careful.
Since your husband's is cop.
The back seat!
-Why the flowers?
- A present for you!
What's this?
You didn't wear any?
Getting bold.!
Why?
Are you cold?
Cold wind is getting in underneath.
"- Next time, let's really go to Manila."
- Don't joke.
- You don't believe me?
- No I don't.
Shall I make reservations now?
"In the summer, we'll go."
Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?
- It only takes him 30 minutes to get home.
Be nice and drink it
He's coming to.
You go out now
Since when have you put on eyeglasses?
It's nice

Which is this way to console someone?
What consolation means to the ruined people?
We're goner!
We're ruined!
"I pray to God, why he didn't picked me?"
Those goons could have kidnapped me in place of Radha.
- God!
My God!
She's a young girl!
And that young boy.
Mohit!
Come here.
Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!
Rub my back.
Come here.
"Come, dear."
Come!
Rub my back.
Why are you rubbing it softly?
Do it with pressure.
That's good!
Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
Never...
I'm a thief.
A goon... a criminal.
I can commit any crime but not this.
Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.
Applejack:
"What are you talkin' about, Pink?"
Pinkie Pie:
The hydra wasn't the doozy.
(hydra blows raspberry)
I'm still gettin' the shudders!
(Pinkie Pie's voice trembles)
You see?!
There it is again!
"Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Twilight:
Huh?
But I...WHAT?!
(seething) The HYDRA wasn't the doozy?!
How could it not be THE DOOZY?!
What could be DOOZlER than THAT?!
Pinkie Pie:
"Dunno, but if this wasn't it... (Twilight grumbles) (Twilight growls)"
Twilight:
"(resigned) Oh, I give up."
Spike:
"Give what up, Twi?"
Twilight:
The fight.
I can't fight it anymore.
"I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense."
"I don't see how it does, but it just does."
Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
Pinkie Pie:
Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Twilight:
"Yup, I guess I do."
2NE1- Falling in Love.
Ju:
"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:
"I feel like Falling in love and touch me over here, touch over there."
Ju:
Exactly.
That's the feeling.
So 1st place Infinite- Destiny!
Ju:
"In our MV Reaction, when I saw the video and listen to this song, I..."
Jana:
Fell in love.
Ju:
I did.
"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.
"I'm now 5% Inspirit, because I'm still a V.I.P , Shawol..."
Jana:
Is that for real?
Ju:
I said 5%!
A bit in my heart!
Jana:
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!
- Stings like mad!
"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!
"- Oh, man!"
- Okay...
Interesting.
- Pull!
- And again!
- Raise it up!
- Stretch it out!
- Stop.
That's good.
Tie it.
Go.
Go.
- Who is that imposter?
Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."
- What's wrong with the mic?
Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."
Or was it Russ you really wanted?
30 seconds!
Where's Jessica?
"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!
No time to proof them.
I'll just have to trust you.
"Now, go, all right?"
"We're live, remember?"
"5, 4, 3, 2..."
"Hello, I'm Jessica Fakewiel..."
Wakefield... with the *Oracle On-Air News.*
"So, here we are... our first live broadcast."
This doesn't look good.
"Oh, the news."
"Well, a lot has happened this week."
Bunches.
"And now... with details, my sister Elizabeth."
I should've known.
Go get 'em.
"(Patty) Manny, pick up Liz as she comes in."
"Thank you, Jessica."
Anytime.

Today's 'Janmastami'.
You've your exams tomorrow.
Who will write that?
Get down!
Why do you always stop for religious things?
He'll be absolutely fine.
My son's playing Govinda.
My son won't become Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
Mahadev.
- Coming.
- Let's go.
- Come soon.
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from.. ..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.
"Now, watch how I sell it for 10-12 thousand."
And keep one idol from each on display.
- Okay.
Understand?
- Yes.
Come on.
One and only one piece in the world.
This idol appeared from the ground.. - Yes. ..when the temple at Badrinath was being built.
What are you saying?
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me.
Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Mitrofanova.
"It's her uncle who's coming, after all."
- Quiet!
- The worst is that tomorrow is Parents' Day!
"- Whatever, they all just come to swim in the sea."
- And his grandma?
- Look out!
"- Back to beds, you lot!"
- You're right.
Kostya's grandma will be here tomorrow.
- Where's my grandson?
Is he putting on weight?
- But he's not here.
Can you imagine what happens next?
"- Hey, guys!"
We need to cancel the Parents' Day!
- Do what?
- Cancel it!
"- Yeah, like you can cancel it."
"- We can claim that, since it's ""Parents' Day,"" only parents are allowed."
- Right.
"- No, seriously!"
"Right now it's grandpas, grandmas, uncles, aunts, and what have you!"
Like they have no other place to go.
- Got it!
I got it!
- What?
- An epidemic!
- What kind?
- Nettle!
- Pull.
- I've got the short one.
Fire!
"Fire!"""
"Kinda defeats the purpose, right?"
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
"I didn't say ""Fire!"", I said ""Fuck!"""
Fuck!

Next is the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker.
This thing is the biggest shit-biscuit I've ever seen.
"You stand on it, and supposedly, you rock back and forth, which controls the D-pad."
The modern-day equivalent would be the Wii Fit.
"The Roll &amp;amp; Rocker is supposed to be compatible with every game for the NES, but I find that it isn't compatible with any of 'em."
"Each game responds differently, but none of them work."
"Adventure Island keeps walking right,"
"Excitebike keeps going down,"
"Skate or Die goes in circles,"
"Kung Fu ducks to the right,"
"Metal Gear does nothing at all,"
Stop giving them money!

"-I'm not racist; I have, like, two black friends."
-Shut up!
-I'm gonna be late for my flight if I don't go right now.
"-All right, have fun in France, man."
"-Oh, by the way, my French cousin's staying over while I'm gone."
-What?
"-Yeah, his name's Pierre."
Bye!
-[gruff voice]:
"'Sup, brother?"
-Pierre?
"-The one and only, brother."
-You don't look very French.
"-You gettin' racist on me, brother?"
"-No, no, I guess I've just never seen a real French person before."
"-Ha-ha, well, we're a fun bunch."
Up high!
Down low.
"Uh... uh... we should go inside like right now, brother."
-We got you now.
"-(Pierre) Macho, macho man"
I want to be... [Nyan Cat ringtone plays]
-Hello?
"-Hey man, how's Pierre?"
"-Uh, he looks and talks like Hulk Hogan."
"-Well, duh, they all do."
Have you never seen a real French person before?
"-Well, I guess not, but, okay, not that there's anything wrong with it, but is Pierre gay?"
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll prepare some mango juice for you.
"That's the problem, Kishen."
You don't have to make mango juice.
Why?
"- I helped you, didn't it?"
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Give my life?
"- No, no."
"- Yes, I can give my life."
"No, no, no."
- I will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to do a small favour for me.
"Yes, tell me."
Remember Mala.
Mala.
That witch Mala.
"- Yes, that witch Mala."
You will have to.. - What?
I've to treat her to mango juice.
"- No, no, no."
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already fallen quite low.
How much further do you want me to make her fall down?
"No, no, I don't mean literally."
How do I explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
No.
"- Oh, God."
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
"Just give him the freaking ""malk""."
[Josh]
You guys aren't even saying the same thing.
[Julian]
"We're all saying ""melk"", Josh!"
[Josh]
No!
"You're saying ""melk""!"
"You're saying ""malk""!"
(Yelling versions of milk)
[Josh]
Shut up!
Shut up!
[Donovan]
You better put it down.
[Julian]
"Don't do it, Josh!"
[Josh]
"You're going to shoot me, if I shoot myself?"
That doesn't even make any sense!
[Donovan and Julian]
"Josh, put it down!"
Put the gun down!
(Yelling at each other to put the gun down)
[Josh]
I'm going to kill myself over this!
[Julian]
You're like a brother to me!
Your head is like a brother to me!
(Screaming)

Sudurretik odol jario handia.
Eten ezinezko diarrea.
Eztarria irritatuta.
Neke handia.
"Ez haurrek bakarrik, adin ezberdinetako jende batzuek ere antzeko sintomak aipatzen dituzte."
"Masamichi Nishio doktorea, Hokkaidoko Kantzer Zentroko burua:"
"Diarrea, nekea, eztarriko mina, odola sudurretan..."
"Jende askok baldin badituzte antzeko sintomak, medikuek ohartu behar dute erradiazio dosi apalen síntoma klinikoak direla."
(emaila:
"""Estomatitisa justu istripuaren ondoren"")."
Ez dituzte mesprexatu behar sukarraldi baten sintomak balira bezala.
"""Txernobyl:"
"Hondamendiaren eraginak gizakietan eta ingurumenean""."
Liburu hau The New York Academy of Sciences-ek argitaratu zuen 2009an.
"Egileak hiru aditu dira, tartean Alexey V. Yablokov doktorea, Bielorrusiakoa, Sobiet Batasunean Gorbatxov presidentearen aholkulari zientifiko izana."
"Aztertu zituzten 2004 aurretik plazaratutako 5.000 txosten zientifiko baino gehiago, ondorioztatuz milioi bat jende hilgo zela istripuaren eraginez."
"Kopuru horrek 20 aldiz bikoizten du ofizialki ICRP erakundeak aipatu izan dituen ""4.000 jendeen heriotzak""."
Yablokov doktoreak ohartarazten du sudurreko odola eta guruin linfatikoen handitzea erradiazioen kalteen sintomak direla.
Ofizialki esan da Txernobylek 4.000 jenderen heriotza ekarri zuela.
Baina horretarako oinarritzen dira ICRP bezala industria nuklearrari lotutako erakundeen txostenetan.
"Ez dago garbi nork duen arrazoi [ICRPk ala Yablokovek], baina bistakoa da bien artean sekulako tartea dagoela."
Nola ulertu tarte hori?
"Begira, ICRPk izendatu zuen batzorde bat gorputz barruko erradiazioak ikertzeko, baina desegin egin zuten."
Zergatik?
Batzorde horrek hainbeste urtean behin azterketa bat egin behar zuelako.
"Baina txosten horretan egia kontatuko balute, gorputz barruko erradiazioen arriskuak azalduko lituzkete, eta ezingo lukete jarraitu energía nuklearra sustatzen."
"Jende asko kaltetu baldin baditu barruko erradiazioak, ... iruditzen zait garaia dela kontutan hartzeko erradiazio mota horren kalteak."
"Bideoan ageri denez, Interneten zabalduta zegoen martxotik ari zela zerbait berezia gertatzen."
"Baina orduan istorio horiek hutsalak edo gezurrezkoak ziruditen, zientzialari batzuek berehala esaten baitzuten aldaketok ez zutela zerikusirik erradiazioekin."
Horrelako giroan jende asko ez zen ausartu hitz egitera edo arazo horien zergaitiak ikertzera.
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!
"- You will find it in the jungle, sir!"
Where is Tiger singh?
"I don""t know!"
"I don""t know! sir.. his grave is ready!"
- My grave?
Bury him alive!
- I will tell you!
I will tell you!
Tiger singh is in lran!
lran?
"This beauty, o beloved."
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.
Problem 29.
Let me see if I need to cut and paste this one in.
All right.
"So yeah, I think it's a good idea."
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
"Look at you, Peter."
Your grades have been steadily declining.
You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know.
I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
"Better do your research, Parker."
"Get it done, or I'm failing you."
Surprise!
"Well, say something."
Whas the occasion?
"Really, Peter."
Is your birthday!
Whether you want to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
"Don't you, Pete?"
"Hi, M.J. Hi."
"Hey, buddy."
Hey.
"Long time, no see."
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
Is going fine.
Is going good.
She's brilliant in it.

No.
Her sponsors here saw the thing on the 'Net.
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."

Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.

Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."
Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj.

"Thank you, your Highness."
You're the Emperor?
I'm the Emperor of Zhennan.
And you're his uncle?
He's told me that... he's worried about you being angry at him.
"So please don't beat him, okay?"
"Miss Mu is very honest, and interesting."
I was going to punish him with the cane.
"But since you've pleaded for him, then it's forgotten."
Yu.
Hurry and thank Miss Mu.
Yes.
"Thank you for your plea, Miss Mu."
Time for your family reunion?
Yes.
"Goodbye, your Highness."
"Mother, let me drink to you."
I can't drink.
And you know that.
"Mother, this calls for a celebration,"
"Come on, Miss Mu toast to you too."
"Come on, let's have a drink."
We're a family from now on.

Apologise.
They were fasting.
Hello.
- We were fasting.
And you gave us alcohol.
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.
It's made from sugarcane.
"It fills you with energy, and makes you lightheaded."
- Rascal.
Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.
Abusing in the month of 'Shravan' (pious month).
See.
Truth sounds bitter than liquor.
There's a limit to cracking jokes.
"Papa, please."
"What you did yesterday, is a sin in mummy's view."
And mummy's fasting today to repent for it.
I want to know.
How can she repent for my sins by fasting?

Fine.
I'll go myself.
I'll chop him to pieces.
No sweat!
"Don't do anything stupid, Moon!"
"Moon, don't!"
Leave me alone!
Stop it!
What's are you doing?
Then go with me!
"Listen to me, will you?"
Leave me alone.
Listen to me!
I approved him of doing that.
Stop it!
What?
You approved of hime?
You mean you had know it?
You approved him for the sale of thousand bucks?
"Moon, get on the car."
Where're you heading?
I've no idea.
"In that case, I'll just drop you alone the way."
I've to go to work.
What did you say?
"Did I hear ""work""?"
Whoa.

Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
Still thanks anyway for saying so.
But I don't want to hear anymore.
"Otherwise, it will be too much to take."
Goodbye.

Sook-hyun wants to break up with you.
"It was too hard for her to say it, so I came instead."
You understand?
Sook-hyun said she's met somebody new.
"Of course you're a good person, and she loved you."
"But without realizing it, a new love appeared."
Please don't take it too hard.
Wish her the best with her new love.
And she hopes that... you'll find a new love too.
With all of her heart.

He's ahead of everyone and number 9 is trying to chase.
Jimmy!
"- C'mon, Rajdoot!"
Jaikishan with Rajdoot on number 9...
Number 16 has crossed number 9.
Number 16 is Jimmy Thapa.
And jimmy Thapa is moving ahead and he's ahead...
Number 9 is exactly in line with number 16.
Number 9 is moving ahead now.
And he has gone much ahead.
Number 9 has left Jimmy Thapa behind.
Ksanka's got to go.

"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?

I like you prettier in girl's clothes.

I won't let you go alone.

"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."
I mean
"Oh, yeah,"
"got the bumper sticker, too?"
"Oh, yes,"
"oh, yes."
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
"Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking."
"I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway."
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
"Uh, well, yeah,"
"for the last, uh, couple of months."
"Yeah,"
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
"My name is, uh, Donna Donahue,"
"and I live in Plano, Texas."
Hi.
"My name is Lowell,"
"and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, do you want to start"
or should I start?
Go right ahead.
"Okay, um,"
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in.
"We have, um, three children,"
"and, um, they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball"
Everybody
Yeah.
Yep.
That would have to be a blast.
"Yeah,"
"it really was, it was great."
"What,"
"well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again"
"and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast."
Yeah.
"And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park."
Okay.
"Oh, wow."
"Okay,"
"Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, um,"
do you have any pets now?
"Well, we don't right now,"
no.
"We've, uh,"
"I grew up with, uh, with pets."
"My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,  some,  birds,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, right now we don't have anything."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, that,"
What about you?
"a matter of choice, or compulsion?"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
"Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that."
Yeah.
"Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
"Uh, the,"
"I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler."
Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
And there's some Coke
"and you know, just help yourself to anything."
"So it was, it was, you know, the best,"
Wow.
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years.
Just once a week.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
"I, I've used that quite a bit"
"and it, and it seems to work real well."
Uh-huh.
"Uh,"
Um.
"And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey"
"and and,"
"Yeah,"
"that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time."
Yeah.
"You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that,"
but I always cooked them ahead of time
"and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it."
Uh-huh.
Have you ever had that?
No.
"What,"
"Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp"
"and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make."
Uh-huh.
The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
"Oh, I'll bet."
"Yeah,"
"I don't like the can, but the fresh."
Yeah.
You know.
I'll have to try that.
"Yeah,"
that was really good.
"I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,"
"and then I,"
"And your time,"
then you're that much farther ahead
Yeah.
"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons."
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
Right.
I've seen them
"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in"
"and,"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
That's neat.
"I went there,"
we have Home Depot out here.
I don't know if you've heard of it.
I went
and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
Yes.
We have one.
I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
Huh.
"Oh, I'm, I'm sure."
"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again."
A band saw?
What?
I did it through Adult Ed again.
Uh-huh.
"And the teacher was one of these negative people,"
"oh that's dangerous,"
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
"I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,"
"And, uh,"
"I, I, I'm not a morning person"
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news.
"I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work"
and then at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
right.
"Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,"
huh-uh.
No
"But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know."
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
"But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then."
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet."
"So, you never know,"
it might this time.
That's right.
"Okay, Tony."
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"
I like it a lot.
How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you grew up in Orlando."
Uh-huh.
"That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,"
"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.

"Uh, what have you had?"
"Well, we had a dog before we moved here."
"Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us."
"We came from Colorado,"
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds.
Oh.
"Okay,"
"I've ,"
"Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up."
Uh-huh.
"Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer,"
and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
"It's usually friends from church and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring."
Yeah.
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something.
"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,"
yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
yeah.
Uh.
It's a lot more relaxing.
"I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone."
Well you see all that on T V
and I could never be that person.
Huh-uh.
"It just, uh, I'm just not,"

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"Thomas Ellis was the first European settler in the area known today as Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area."
"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

Squirrels is a one-act play by David Mamet.
"The 1974 comedy is about Arthur, a middle-aged, egotistical hack writer who has been working on the opening line of a story involving a man's encounter with a squirrel for fifteen years, and Edmond, the young fledgling writer he has hired as a secretary/collaborator. They soon discover that Arthur's flamboyant redundancy clashes with Edmond's mediocre melodramatic style as they each develop increasingly ridiculous scenarios for the story. They are joined by Arthur's cleaning lady, also an aspiring writer, whose suggestions seem to be the most promising, but they too eventually bog down in banality."
"In October 1974 Mamet directed the first production of the play at the St. Nicholas Theater Company in Chicago, Illinois. ""Squirrels"" was produced by the Philadelphia Festival Theatre for New Plays, in January 1990, at the Harold Prince Theatre, Annenberg Center. The director was William H. Macy, who had performed in the Chicago production."

In the early 2013 during the preparation for the regular festival an intellectual property rights conflict took place. Among other things it referred to the Jazz May brand. In the media there was a statement on possibility of making two independent festivals. As a result there was the only Jazz May but the main organizer (The Penza State Philharmonic) had to change its logo.

Lazar played at the Pursuit of Excellence Hockey Academy before playing in the CSSHL with the Okanagan Hockey Academy during the 2010–11 season. During the 2011–12 season he helped his Edmonton Oil Kings team capture the Ed Chynoweth Cup as the WHL Champions. During the 2012–13 season he played with Team Canada to win a gold medal at the 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, and was an invited participant at the 2013 CHL Top Prospects Game."
"Lazar's playing style had been compared to that of Edmonton Oilers' forward Milan Lucic and former Senators' forward Mike Fisher.

Following the tournament's conclusion, Lazar rejoined the Senators."
"In the 2016–17 season, Lazar's development with the Senators stalled as his produced 1 assist in 33 games including a demotion to the AHL with the Binghamton Senators. On March 1, 2017, Lazar was dealt at the NHL trade deadline by the Senators along with Michael Kostka to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a 2017 second-round pick and Jyrki Jokipakka."
"On July 14, 2017, the Flames re-signed Lazar to a two-year, $1.9 million contract extension worth $950,000 annually."

Having made just one appearance with Calgary in the regular season he was not tendered a qualifying offer with the Flames on June 25, 2019, enabling him to become a free agent."
"On July 1, 2019, Lazar agreed to a one-year $700,000 contract with his third NHL club, the Buffalo Sabres."

"However, it is only called for in three cantatas by name, BWV 46, 162 and 67."
"Its characteristics are debated, but it was most likely a horn that resembled the ""Inventions"" horn of the late 18th century: ""a freely-moving, double (cylindrical) tuning slide positioned diametrically across its circular body"". It may also have been a slide trumpet."
