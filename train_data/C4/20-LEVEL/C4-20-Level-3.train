A bus.
A bus.

"Yeah Craigy were on about a bus, a bus  and erm little'un said bus."
"Oh, she"
And then our Craigy said erm Home and Away nan  Home and Away nan.
Did he?
Mm.
Chuffing hell.
Thought ooh bloody hell.
His speech is getting a lot better.
It's not clear though Kath.
"And he, he'd shout and"
I thought that were that Brian now.
Where?
I don't know.
Can't see where they've gone.
Oh  it looks like him.
What the crippled Brian?
He's looking at your house.
Crippled Brian?
He's looking at your house.
Or is he looking at the bus?
He's looking at the bus.
"He walked up here, walked to your house, looked at the bus  I don't know  where'd he come from"
And do you know that's only trouble with these nets
"I'm gonna have a wee   Bill's bloody worse, he stands there, he looks out the bloody window as much as any bugger."
"He has he's just parked car, walked up here, looked at bus and walked back again."
"Well anyway, him then."
Yeah.
Did you know?
Yeah.
Was a lot of blood.
Mm  .
How did he fall over?
Oh he'd been tripped.
"Cor right, he went  woosh!"
Woosh!
Woosh!
When he got up they was like that.
What?
"He had a tooth, that went straight through his bottom lip."
"Yeah you could see the tooth outside, I thought  Ahhh!"
Yorrible!
My name is Jonathan
Mrs  said he was ever so good.
Mm.
Well I think we better have our tea if daddy's here in a minute.
So get that Lego off the table and  you tea.
"My name is Jonathan, I am a boy"
I'd like to be a big fat boy !
Don't be silly Jonathan!
I've got an ambition and it is to grow fat  I'd like to grow like a big fat .
"You're not funny, that's ever so silly!"
Can you guess what the last one word was gonna be?
No.
Now where's Fudge in or out?
In.
Is he?
Yeah.
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND
"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used sobriquet"
"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....

Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man

After a pause she made another attempt.

REQUIES.
O IS it death or life
That sounds like something strangely known
"In this subsiding out of strife,"
This slow sea-monotone?
"A sound, scarce heard through sleep,"
Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
About the roots of trees.
"O is it life or death,"
"O is it hope or memory,"
That quiets all things with this breath
Of the eternal sea?

"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"""He'll take offense,"" the lawyer murmured, considering the matter."
But Solem urged him on:
"""I don't think so. Anyhow, you were the first one to talk about it."""
"""Everybody here will know, and I'll be prevented,"" said the lawyer."
"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"insects.  Each of these bright frail, growing things had life and"
individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."

"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—
"and a little below the forty-five latitude ring?"""
"""Yes."""
It was a small round disc no more than an inch in diameter.
"""We think that may be a response."""
"Wilson said, ""You mean a target? Possibly one of the lifeships?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I'll have a scooter go out and see. What's its spacial position?"""
"The tech took another look. ""I'd say eighty-one plus longitude and"
"forty-three latitude."""
"""From what?"" demanded Wilson."
"""From ship's axis, sir."""
"""Distance?"""
"""Oh, about half a parsec."""
"Wilson groaned. ""Haven't you determined any spacial attitude?"""
"""Attitude, sir?"""
"""The angle of the ship's axis with respect to the stellar positions."
So you've a blotch out there at half a parsec. It's an inch or so in

There was no mistaking then--no need to contrast her feeling of anxiety

Sir Gilders Persimmon shuffled into the room; and Pangbutt went to meet
the old baronet.
"“Lady Persimmon coming to-night, Sir Gilders?” he shouted into his ear;"
the old man shook his head.
"“Sorry,” bawled Pangbutt into his ear; “Sir Gilders, allow me to"
"introduce Mr. Fosse, who, I need not tell you, is the well-known"
critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” cried Fosse, getting very hot--“I did not say"
borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”

The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.

Kilshaw nodded again.

He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the

"Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated."
Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly
narrowing to none.

It wasn't a question. It was a statement.

said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”
"“You are not taking it into account, my dear Cæsar, that the Church is"
still powerful and that it doesn’t pardon people who impose upon it.”
“Bah! I am not afraid of it.”

"it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while"
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the

"the latter screamed and ran away, crying:"

THE MASTER GIRL
"""A mother's tender hand,"" said the King of Euralia,"
"""is--er--never--good gracious!  What's that?"""
There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"
impression of ginger whiskers and large boots.  Do we know anybody
"like that?"""
"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"
"know about his boots."""
"""But what could he have been doing up there?  Unless----"""
There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.
"""You're quite right, Hyacinth,"" he said sternly; ""it _was_ the King of"
"Barodia."""
Hyacinth looked troubled.
"""He oughtn't to come over anybody's breakfast table quite so quickly"
"as that.  Ought he, Father?"""

One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy in
"1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and hanged at White Point on November"
8th.
"SCUDAMORE, CHRISTOPHER."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern in
"Hanover Street, Boston, in 1704, and hanged on Charles River, Boston Side,"
"on June 30th. A report of the trial and execution of these pirates,"
"describing Scudamore's conduct on the gallows, says: ""He appeared very"

"SCUDAMORE, PETER."
Belonging to Bristol.
"Surgeon in the _Mercy_ galley, and taken by Captain Roberts in 1721. It"
was a rule on all pirate vessels for the surgeon to be excused from
"signing the ship's articles. When the next prize was taken, if she carried"
"a surgeon, he was taken in place of their present one, if the latter"
wished to leave. But when Scudamore came on board the _Royal Fortune_ he
"“Are you sure he did it?” asked Kennedy, more, I felt, for its moral"
effect on her than through any doubt in his own mind.
"“Not sure. But then the wall safe shows no marks, and the replica is"
gone.”
“Might I see your jewel case?” he asked.
“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably
have to fuss a long time with the combination.”
In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"
"drumming absently on the arms of his chair, suddenly rose and walked"
quietly over to a scrap basket that stood beside an escritoire. It had
"evidently just been emptied, for the rooms must have been cleaned"
several hours before. He bent down over it and picked up two scraps of
paper adhering to the wicker work. The rest had evidently been thrown
away.
I bent over to read them. One was:

And the voice was gone.

Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was

"influential persons in Spain, he had no objection."
They took leave of the abbé.
"“All this has to go slowly,” said Kennedy."
“Of course. One cannot insist that it should happen all at once.”
_BERNINI_
"“If you have nothing to do, let’s take a walk,” said the Englishman."
“If you like.”
“Have you noticed the fountains in this square?”
“No.”
“They are worth looking at.”
Cæsar contemplated the central obelisk. It is set on top of a rock
"hollowed out like a cavern, in the mouth of which a lion is seen."
Afterwards they looked at the fountains at the ends of the square.
"“The sculptures are by Bernini,” explained Kennedy. “Bernini belonged to"
"an epoch that has been very much abused by the critics, but nowadays he"
is much praised. He enchants me.”
"“It is rather a mixed style, don’t you think?”"

"Severance sauntered up and down the “Forty Steps,” the repose of his"
bearing belying the agitation within.
“Why on earth doesn’t she come?” he thought uneasily. “Can she be ill
again? She is ten minutes behind time now. What did it mean—all those
"fellows there last night? She looked like an amused spectator at a play,"
"and Miss Decker was nervous, actually nervous. Damn it! Here they all"
come. What do they mean by keeping under my heels like this?”
"Dedham, Trent, and Boswell strolled up from various directions, and,"
"although each had expectation in his eye, none looked overjoyed to see"
"the other men. There were four cold nods, a dead pause, and then Teddy"
gave a little cough.
“Beautiful after—I mean morning.”
"“It is indeed,” said Severance. “I wonder you are not taking your"
salt-water constitutional.”
“I always take a walk in the morning;” and Teddy glanced nervously over
"“Cheer up, Andrew,” he cried."
Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”
"""I can't."""
"""She'll be hurt, Alicia. She'll think you don't care. Come, dear."""
"""Tell her--tell her I'm coming directly. Eleanor, you must let me go,"""
and breaking away she fled into the house.
Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"
"she summed up her impressions by remarking,"

"a cushion. Trent, who had been detained a moment by Miss Decker,"
advanced to her.
"“It is very soon to come again,” he said, “but I simply had to call and"
inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently
do.”
"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"
"leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the ring to Miss Decker and raised her"
eyes guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and get the other?”
“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”
“I forgot that water ruins stones.”
"“Well, it is a consolation to know that water does not ruin a certain"
plain gold circlet.”
“Mr. Boswell!”
Jessica gasped and looked at the flames. A crisis had come. Would she be

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"
"puckalow that case and foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a"
"tablecloth as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."""
When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your
"name Sapristi?"""
"""Nom de Dieu----"" began the Frenchman, but Jones waved his hand with"
dignity.
"""Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you got anythin' in the way of"
"a marlinspike or a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"""
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that
"isn't possible. Oh, Lois, there is surely nothing worse than helpless"
"remorse!"""
The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked
"it. I failed him."""
"""Have you really failed him?"""
"""Lois, I don't know--I am beginning to believe not. But it is too"
late. I meant to clear away the rubbish--and build. But there is no
"time."""

"White flashes dance along the deep,"
That moans as if uneasily
It turned in an unquiet sleep.
Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves
A toppling crest that falls in spray
Where the tormented beach receives
The buffets of the sea’s wild play.
"On the horizon’s nearing line,"
"Where the sky rests, a visible wall."
"Grey in the offing, I divine"
The sails that fly before the squall.
UNDER THE CLIFFS.
BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon’s verge;
"To leeward, stormy shadows, violet-black,"
And the wide sea between
A vast unfurrowed field of windless green;
The stormy shadows flicker on the track
Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge.

"I watch the white sun walk across the sea,"
"One of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping, in June,"
"1724. He was not one of the original crew of the _George_ galley, but was"

Hanged in Virginia in 1718 along with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.

"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"
"Slyne's as if, Sallie thought, for some sign that that shaft had hit"
home.
"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"
"and traded some bonds."""
"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the

"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""

Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"

Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”

"The duke paused a moment, as if endeavoring to bring order into the"
"chaos of his thoughts. He scanned Francesco from head to toe, as if"
there was something about the latter's personality which he could not
reconcile with his previous acquaintance.
At last Francesco's worldly habit flashed upon him.
"""What of the Cross?"" he flashed abruptly."
"""There is blood upon it!"" retorted Francesco."

"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"

"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"

Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--

will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.

For a moment Terence looked incredulously at the torpedo-lieutenant.
"""Torps,"" he knew, was fond of a practical joke, but if he were"
playing a prank it was carrying the game a little too far.
"""Here you are,"" continued Oswestry, noting the expression on"

"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"

"ONE little cab to hold us two,"
"Night, an invisible dome of cloud,"
"The rattling wheels that made our whispers loud,"
As heart-beats into whispers grew;
"And, long, the Embankment with its lights,"
"The pavement glittering with fallen rain,"
"The magic and the mystery that are night’s,"
And human love without the pain.
"The river shook with wavering gleams,"
Deep buried as the glooms that lay
"Impenetrable as the grave of day,"
Near and as distant as our dreams.
A bright train flashed with all its squares
Of warm light where the bridge lay mistily.
"The night was all about us: we were free,"
Free of the day and all its cares!
"That was an hour of bliss too long,"
Too long to last where joy is brief.
Yet one escape of souls may yield relief
To many weary seasons’ wrong.

It ended: heaven was done.

That heaven was but begun.

“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"

Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."

"network of gleaming white lines frosted over with white shading, to"

THE RAIDERS OF THE SARHAD
a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""
"""No, I don't believe it yet!"" rapped out the Girl, laying great stress"
"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"
look and voice rebuking him for his words.
It was left to Ashby to spring another surprise.

handled casually.
Wednesday 10:30 A.M.
"An armoured van with V.C.S., Ltd. lettered on its side pulled up to the"
black marble front of Moscow Narodny Bank's financial trading branch on
Saint Swithins Lane. Everything was on schedule.
"""They're here."" Eva was watching from the narrow window. Saint Swithins"
"Lane down below, virtually an alley, was so narrow it could accommodate"
"only one vehicle at a time. Across was Banque Worms, its unicorn"
"insignia staring out, its lobby chandeliers glowing. Nobody there even"
bothered to notice. Just another armored truck interrupting the view.
Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached
"the rear doors from both sides, .38's in unsnapped holsters."
"""Mr. Vance, they had better have the money, all of it."" Vera stepped"
over to the window and followed Eva's gaze down.
"""It'll be there."""
"""For your sake I hope so,"" she replied as she turned back."
"""Just hang around and watch,"" Vance said."
"Just one more day, he told himself. One more lousy day. We'll have"
not nearly so good as we thought it. The illusion is the sweet thing.
Don’t break the butterfly.
Tell him also that both of you have much of my heart.
"Yours,"
NOLL.
P.S.--I am tired of myself. I am off to find Betty.”
Noll sealed the letter and wrote a third--to the concierge:
"“MADAME,"
I am called away to England. Mademoiselle Madelaine Le Trouvé has
been good enough to take charge of the rooms until madame and
myself return. Pray give the enclosed to your little ones ‘from the
Englishman who knows how to laugh.’
"Agréez, etc.,"
OLIVER BADDLESMERE.”
"He stole to where Madelaine slept, and on the chair by her bed he put"
her letter and some banknotes.
"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"
"leather kit-bag, and carried it to where the candle gave light. From"
"the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two trinkets,"
and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went into the bag.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.

"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."
"""It ain't any good talkin',"" said Jack, ""and hevery one knows that"
give a Frenchman the chance of hargument he'll talk a government
"mule's 'ind leg off.  'Hout of this,' is the on'y hargument a"
"Frenchman hunderstands."""
"""But they seems to be a good many more of 'em than us,"" suggested the"
crowd.
"""Come to that,"" said Hart, ""it's the on'y just ground we 'as to go"
"for 'em.  For if they was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to"
"whack 'em, and I for one would be on the side of just goin' down"
there and shovin' them out peaceful.  I'm for the hultimatum right
"off.  I wonder 'ow the Guffin will put it.  Say, boys, 'ere 'e comes!"""
"The ""old man"" staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand."
"""Have you done it, sir?"" asked Simcox.  ""Let's hear it."""
"""Yes, read it out,"" said Lampert, with half a sneer, which the"
skipper did not notice.
The crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock.
"""On board the British barque _Potluck_, belonging to the British port"
"Liverpool; owners, McWattie & Co.; Captain Abednego Jones."
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir----"""
"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.
"""And before that--?"" he suggested, politely patient."
"""Before that she was--what she still is so far's I'm concerned--Saleh"
"Harez, my adopted daughter."""
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""
"""In case,"" Kilshaw read, ""of my death or disappearance, please deliver"
"this parcel to Mr. Kilshaw, Legislative Assembly, Kirton."""
"""I'm sorry to say, sir,"" said the Superintendent, ""that the detective"
sergeant conducting the search took upon him to open this packet in the
presence of one or two persons. It ought to have been opened by no one
"but----"""
"""Myself."""
"""Pardon me, but myself,"" said the Superintendent, with a slight smile."
"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"
"everywhere; you can't keep 'em out."""
"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"
"photograph of two persons, a young woman and a young man. ""Look at the"
"back,"" he added."
"Kilshaw looked, and read--""My wife and M."""
"""That's the deceased's handwriting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And you know the persons?"""
"""I've no doubt about them. It's the Premier--and--and Mrs. Medland."""
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
"Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling"
"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.
*       *       *       *       *
"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
"for the disapprobation of the Kirton mob, they held that in high scorn."
"""They'd cheer burglary, if Medland did it,"" said one."
"""Well, he wants to, pretty nearly,"" added a capitalist."
"""But the country will take a very different view. Puttock'll rub it into"
"all his people: _they_'ll not vote for him. What do you say, Coxon?"""
"""I think we shall beat him badly,"" said that gentleman, as he rose and"
went out.
"Captain Heseltine soon followed, and was surprised to see Coxon's figure"
just ahead of him as he entered the gates of Government House.
"""Hang the fellow! What does he want here?"" asked the Captain."
"Mr. Coxon asked for Lady Eynesford. When he entered, she rose with a"
newspaper in her hand.
"""What a shocking, shameful thing this is!"" she said. ""What a blessing it"
"is that the Government was beaten!"""
Coxon acquiesced in both these opinions.
"""I never thought well of him,"" continued the lady. ""Now everybody sees"
him in his true colours. And it's you we have chiefly to thank for our
"deliverance."""
"Coxon murmured a modest depreciation of his services, and said,"
"""I hope Miss Derosne is well?"""
But now art sunk beneath the sod.
"Here lost and gone poor Robin lies,"
"He trembles, lingers, falls and dies."
"He's gone, he's gone, forever lost,"
No more of him they now can boast.
"Poor Robin's dangers all are past,"
He struggled to the very last.
"Perhaps he spent a happy Life,"
Without much struggle and much strife.

The prolonged gloom of the main theme is somewhat lightened by the
speculative optimism of the last verse.
"Life, transient Life, is but a dream,"
Like Sleep which short doth lengthened seem
"Till dawn of day, when the bird's lay"
Doth charm the soul's first peeping gleam.
"Then farewell to the parting year,"
Another's come to Nature dear.
"In every place, thy brightening face"
Does welcome winter's snowy drear.
Alas! our time is much mis-spent.
Then we must haste and now repent.

For we on Wisdom should be bent.

“Good.”
"They saw the model of an ancient galley which was in the same hall, and"
went out through the church into the garden planned by Piranesi.
"The woman showed them a very old palm, with a hole in it made by a"
hand-grenade in the year ‘49. It had remained that way more than half
"a century, and it was only a few days since the trunk of the palm had"
broken.
"From the garden they went, by a path between trees, to the bastion of"
"Paul III, a little terrace, from which they could see the Tiber at their"
"feet, and opposite the panorama of Rome and its environs, in the light"
of a beautiful spring sunshine....
"XVIII. CÆSAR BORGIA’S MOTTO, “AUT CÆSAR, AUT NIHIL”"
_THE BORGIAS_
The next day was one of the days for visiting the Borgia Apartment.
"Cæsar and Kennedy met in the Piazza di San Pietro, went into the"
"Vatican museum, and walked by a series of stairs and passageways to the"
Gallery of Inscriptions.
"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"
"""Want to give you a little tip, too. They want you upstairs. A"
"commendation. Not generally known, though. And you deserve it. You'll be"
"called up tomorrow."""
"""You never know the day or the hour."""
"The laugh came again. ""You're humor is priceless, old man."""
"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"

"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"

"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."

I must say that I was surprised at finding Mrs. Moulton there. Outside
"the suite Winters and I waited with the unresisting Muller, while"
Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he began, “something terrible has happened—”"
"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.
"“Where is Mr. Moulton?” he went on, changing his question."
"“Mr. Moulton is at his office,” she answered tremulously. “He"
"telephoned while I was out that he had to work to-night. Oh, Mr."
Kennedy—he knows—he knows. I know it. He has avoided me ever since I
missed the replica from-”
“Sh!” cautioned Craig. He had risen and gone to the door.

office. Meanwhile Jameson can take care of Muller. I am going over to
that place of Stein’s presently. Bring Moulton up there. You will wait

"SICCADAM, JOHN."
Of Boston.
"One of Captain Pound's crew. Found guilty of piracy, but pardoned."
"SIMMS, HENRY, _alias_ ""GENTLEMAN HARRY."" Pickpocket, highwayman, pirate,"
and Old Etonian.
Born in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to
"school at Eton, where he ""shewed an early inclination to vice,"" and at the"
age of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No
"Old Etonian, either then or now, would stand that kind of treatment, so"
"Simms ran away, becoming a pickpocket and later a highwayman. After"
"numerous adventures and escapes from prison, he was pressed on board"
"H.M.S. _Rye_, but he deserted his ship at Leith. After an ""affair"" at"
"Croydon, Simms was transplanted with other convicts to Maryland, in the"
"_Italian Merchant_. On the voyage he attempted, but without success, to"
raise a mutiny. On his arrival in America he was sold to the master of the
"_Two Sisters_, which was taken a few days out from Maryland by a Bayonne"

“Which means? Please tell me. I am here to know.”
"“She will take some time to recover from her injuries, and of course her"
nerve is broken.”
"“I'm afraid,” said John, “your institution can't afford many invalid's"
luxuries.”
"“None at all,” replied the weary-faced woman. “She gets proper care and"
"attention, however.”"
John drew out a five-pound note. “Can you buy her any little things
"with this? When you have spent it, if you will tell me, I 'll send you"
another.”
"“It's against our rules,” said the Sister, eying the money. “If you like"
"to give it as a subscription to the general funds, I will accept it.”"
“Are you badly off?” asked John.
“We are very slenderly endowed.”
John pushed the note across the small table near which they were
sitting.
containing the necklace. It was stolen from Schloss to whom you sold
"_my_ jewels. The other old bag, stolen from me, contains the paste"
replica you had made to deceive me.”
It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or
"Stein, as you please—pulled off, some as a blind to conceal the real"
"criminal. You may have shown him how to leave no finger prints, but you"
yourself have left what is just as good—your own forehead print.
"McLear—you were right. There’s your criminal—Lynn Moulton, professional"
"fence, the brains of the thing.”"
CHAPTER XIX
THE GERM LETTER
“Did you know that this man was alive when you married me?” he asked in
a hard voice.
"“No,” cried Yvonne. “How could I have married you? I thought he had been"
dead nearly three years.”
“What proofs did you have of his death?”
"“A friend sent me a number of the Figaro, with the announcement.”"
“Was that all?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne."
"“Do you mean to tell me,” he insisted, “that you married a second time,"
having no further proofs of your first husband’s death than a mere
newspaper report?”
"“It never occurred to me to doubt it,” she replied, opening piteous,"
innocent eyes.
The childlike irresponsibility was above his comprehension. Her apparent
insensibility to the most vital concerns of life was another shock to
him. It seemed criminal.
"“God forgive you,” he said, “for the wrong you have done me.”"
"“But I did it unknowingly, Everard,” cried poor Yvonne. “If one has to"
"get greater proofs, why did you not ask for them, yourself?”"
"The Canon turned away and paced the room slowly, without replying. At"
"free from distinct irritating qualities, it should be taken on an empty"
"stomach; as when digestion is going on, the contents of the stomach are"
acid in reaction and if alkalies are given combinations take place and
"salts are formed. If alkalies are given before digestion begins,"
"diffusion of the acid-forming constituents of the blood takes place, and"
in this way the acidity of the gastric juice is promoted; likewise acids
given before meals increase the diffusion of the alkaline constituents
of the blood.

"Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took"
over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me--and a
girl besides--she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
husbands in the one place they're still to be had--the planet
Venus--and you know I'll be in trouble.
"Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into."
"Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled"
out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.
"""I think I _tried_ to fight."""
"""Of course, you did. The disgrace was mine. I acted like a child. I"
should have realized that something extraordinary had happened. But I
"nursed my miserable little ego like a three-year-old."""

"""Don't talk like that! I knew about the ninth android, and I met the"
tenth one in front of your apartment that second morning. I should have

"""It's all over now. It doesn't make any difference."""
"""No, it doesn't make any difference."""
"She looked at him in silence for several moments. ""You've changed,"
"Frank."""
"""Yes, I guess I have. I guess we all grow up eventually. We all face"
"reality and live with it."""
"""Frank--I think I'm going to cry."""
He could not turn his eyes in her direction. He looked straight ahead
"but his voice was soft. ""Go ahead, Rhoda. I understand."""
"They were silent for a time, then Rhoda began to cry quietly into her"
handkerchief. After a while even that sound was stilled.
He turned to look at her. She was standing beside the bed. He almost
"reached out and took her hand, but drew his own back at the last minute."

"She finished with a little nervous laugh, as people will to hide their"
real feelings.
"“I should like to see the dog,” remarked Kennedy simply."
"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her
face. This was serious business.
"A few minutes later she reappeared, carrying gingerly a small dog"
basket. Mrs. Blake lifted the lid. Inside was a beautiful little
"“Peke,” and it was easy to see that Buster was indeed ill."
"“Who is your doctor?” asked Craig, considering."
"“Dr. Rae Wilson, a very well-known woman physician.”"
"Kennedy nodded recognition of the name. “What does she say?” he asked,"
observing the dog narrowly.
"“We haven’t told anyone, outside, of it yet,” replied Mrs. Blake. “In"
"fact until Buster fell sick, I thought it was a hoax.”"
“You haven’t told anyone?”

The skipper shook his head impatiently.
"""I thought you'd 'ave knowed, Simcox.  You're the hambassador, and"
"you've to communicate this to 'em."""
"""Oh, go on, sir,"" said the crowd."
The skipper resumed:
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir, you'll be so good as to be so kind as to"
communicate the contents of this 'ere letter to them French of the

"can't be allowed, as it's contrary to law in such case made and"
"purvided.  So you'll inform 'em it ain't goin' to be put up with, and"
"they must evacuate immejit and resume the _statues quo_----"""
"""What's that?"" asked Simcox."
"""It's Latin, you unutterable ass,"" said the skipper, with a look of"
Myre went suddenly dumb....
"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"But she herself owned this to be as inartistic as it was unintentional,"
"stamping her foot with annoyance at the mischance. Indeed, she"
"apologized most handsomely; for, said she, pathetically, when she had"
got it she did not know what to do with it.
It was an anticlimax.
She threw down the whip and said he might now go home.
He now went home.
There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour’s sister hastened Mr. Myre’s desire to start the great
renaissance of the English drama.
As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and shaved
"off the remains of his drooping moustache by the candle’s light, and"
"soothed the aching bumps that were risen upon his face, he sniffed"
loudly through a swollen nose--he had very tender places--and decided
to go to Rouen until the hair grew.

"""Why?"""
"""Because it is a mystery, and in all probability she will endeavour to"
preserve the secret.  She must not see the Countess before we question
"her."""
"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am
"about to say, will you?"""
"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""
"""What do you mean?""  I inquired quickly."
"""I mean that when you parted from her this afternoon you were not"
"altogether good friends."""
"""You are mistaken,"" I assured him.  ""We were as good friends as ever"
"PHILLIPS, WILLIAM."
Born at Lower Shadwell.
"Boatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while"
"lying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates"
"from Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the"
"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"

"You, Aurora ..."
I said yes!
"Oh, sorry."

Yeah.
You can have it if you go first.
Are you sure?

She laughs when she's scared.
"Dude, I thought it was a ghost."
Really?
A ghost?
"I'm afraid of ghosts, okay."
"Riley, keep going."
"Okay, okay, okay."
Wait a second.
What?
What do you think are behind these doors?
"Oh, you know."
"Cleaning supplies, toilet paper."
Really?

Not really.

- What suitcase?
- Hers.
They found it floating in the river.
Castro.
Who was it?
I don't know.
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.
Late means late.
"What do I do if there's no phone, paint one?"
"I'm working, don't start."
I am calm.
You're the one who isn't!
Good morning.
I'm sorry.

"You're going back, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Klaus, we're gonna move you back to Bowmanville."
And I wanted to apologize.
How is your social life?
It's been a bit easier over the phone.
"Everything seems to indicate - that you have severe exhaustion, in other words, burnout."
Take one of these in the morning.
Things are a bit better now.
"Well, it varies, you see."
Any hobbies?
-No.
Relatives?
No.
Wife?
No.
There must be more to life than work.
Perhaps a small trip?

"Is this, a fucking debate squad?"
Is this debating club?
Am I standing in the middle of debating club?
"I'm like, you fucking died."
"That was pretty good, huh?"
"Dude, there's no way."
"Oh, he's gonna kill me when he sees this, man."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, we'll shoot."
We'll shoot it.
Nice working with you.
Shit you're so screwed man.

We're friends now.
Don't scratch.
It's perfect already.
Just check and send.
You'll miss your bedtime.
Huh?

- You're not going?
- Yes.
Take care now.
- Do you mind?
- What are you doing with Hanne?
Nothing.
We were just having fun.
Why not just tell your dad and your friends the truth?
Don't be jealous.
You're the one I'm crazy for.
Why didn't you call?
I left thousands of messages.
I was at my father's.
I couldn't talk.
I missed you so badly.
Come here.
Wait here.
Who is she?
Michelle.
The daughter of a business associate.
You are going to marry her.
Thank you.
Don't go to the police station again.
You may end up in an even bigger trouble.
Not all cops will be honest like me.
Got it?
Panju.
If 333 number is Ashwini's...
The victim is related to Ashwini.
"But, Ashwini... has not shared that detail with Manoj."
"So, our next target is..."

Please wait.
"We are checking, right?"
- What is this?
Wait.
What is this?
"Nothing, Sir."
Why are they hitting the waiter?
"Well, what do you mean you don't-- What do you mean you don't need me?"
"- Al, if I'm here to help this girl,"
- You don't need... me?
I'm a little late.
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Maybe I will sit this one out.

November 9?
What?
What?
Today's her birthday.
She's 1 9.
Forever.
Why am I here?
I told you we don't know.
It's gotta have something to do with her.
Right?
"Who was she, Al?"
Who was she?
What songs did she like to sing?
Who'd she dream about at night?
William Holden.
What?
William Holden.
It's 1 957.
She's a teenager.
She had to have a crush on either William Holden orJames Dean.
"Uh, knowing her background, my money's on Bill."
It's been 3 weeks.

Stay calm.
You are alright now.
In fact there is a surprising.
You've had an eye surgery.
You are going to get your sight back!
Your bandages will be removed today.
Can you please be clear?
- Doctor is here.
What is he saying?
He has isn't able to understand what's happening.
He is tensed.
"Nothing to worry, Mr.Varun."
You are absolutely fine.
Just relax.
"Open your eyes, slowly."
"Varun, give it a try."
Slowly...
Try...
Are you able to see?
Can you see?
One.
Two.
- Yes!
Varun!
I was scared!
Let him take rest.
I'll come back later.
It's Sadhana.
Mom.
"That's why I am saying, dear."
The life that you were leading in Jaipur..
..you will have to change that when you go to Mumbai.
Well.
Take this.
What is this?
- It's a calendar.
Read it.
And this is a diary.
"Dear, I just want you to begin a new life."
And record each moment of your life in this diary.
Okay?
"Yes, mom."
I will write.
Anything else?
"And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot."
"Yes, mom."
"Mumbai, yeah!"
Come on.
"Coming, Pia."
Two minutes.
And how is it going in Jaipur?
Everything is fine.
Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur.
How are mom and dad?
- Very well.
Very good.
Yeah?
- Excuse me.
"Gul, whose call was it?"
Two hours ago he was my boyfriend.
You will never change.

Bring it on bedtime pill!
I'm not afraid of you.
"Kai, let's play badminton."
Huh?
Badminton.
What?
Hurry.
Alright.
Don't hit it left and right like that.
I'm tired.
What's with all this technique!
Gosh!
I'm so beyond this bedtime pill.
December.
Number 190.
Number 190.
Number 190.
Next number 191.
"Je, I sent it."
I really hate you sometimes.
No.
Look.
Here.
Feel.
- Feel.
- Where?
Here?
Just as I thought:
Cirrhosis pectoris.
What's that mean?
That means your eyes are twin pools of desire.
"Oh, doctor."
That's nice.
The things you do say.
"That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
- Yes.
Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.
Wait!
Wait.
My ankle.
Don't you think you ought to look at that?
No.
"No, your ankle's all right."
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.
- That stops the circulation.
That's bad.
"- There, you see?"
You did find something.
"You are my doctor, aren't you?"
- Holy crap.
I knew it was you.
I haven't seen you in years.
"Hey-Hey-Hey, Frankie, it's me."
Bobby Thunderson.
- Yes.
Yes.
"Yes, Bobby."
- Look at you!
You... really let yourself go.
"Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form?"
"No, I'm actually, uh, teaching my daughter some self-defense."
Holy...
"Holy shit, man."
I'm training my daughter too.
"Hey, what do you know?"
"Hey, look at her."
Look at her over there.
"Look, look, look."
Oh!
Amazing.
"Hey, she's pretty too, huh?"
"Like her old man, huh?"
"- Well, it's really nice seeing you, Bob."
- Yeah.
"Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you."
You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.
"Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes."
- Ass... hole.
"- Yeah, asshole."
"Okay, don't listen to anything he says."
He's a real creep.
Come here.
And... you're married.
I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.
It's not really enough to build a relationship on.
You keep it away!
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
No one.
Who are you?
"She's, she's all right."
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
"Okay, I'll talk to you."
"I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?"
"No, I just, I'm going through something and I just have to...."
"No, no...."
There's nothing.
"Hey, thanks a lot."
-Want a drink?
-Please.
What do you drink?
Scotch.
Ice and water.
No ice.
I'll get some from the kitchen.
That's all right.
I'll take it straight.
Please sit.
Where's her father?
In Europe.
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.
"Well, I think you should."
I told Regan that was holy water.
I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently.
It's tap water.
- But you have to do it.
- Listen.
- You have to do this.
You promised.
Do it!
Put the.
Dave .. please help!
None of your business!
Damn!
Please!

"Addons Thi time has expired, Dave."
Damn.
"- No, no."
- Stopping You.
What are you doing?
I do it just to stop it.
He wants to ...
I do it just to stop it.
Addons Thank you for participating in the game ...
"Addons ""Resist or Die""."
Now you understand.
"Addons Unfortunately, the failure of Dave, and failure is You are so ..."
Sarah should be dead.
Lord!
"He died in vain,"
He died in vain.

"It's a little too late to be careful, sir."
"I'm sorry, I..."
"Oh, what is going on here?"
Will somebody get the security guards?
"I can't tell you how sorry I am, sir..."
"Would you mind very much, sir for making this disturbance."
I really can't tell you.
My name is Columbo.
I'm from the police.
We're ready when you are.
"WELL, APPARENTLY SHE'S GOT MOBLEY."
"NO, I MEAN TO ATTRACT A MAN."
"OH, FORGET THEM, LOVE."
I'M WORRIED.
ABOUT THE JOB?
WHAT ELSE?
KYNE WORRIES ME.
"HE WAS HUMILIATED TODAY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,"
AND IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU MADE UP FOR IT WITH THE SCOOP ON MOBLEY ON HIS OWN TELECAST.
LET ME TELL YOU THE FACTS OF LIFE.
THAT BREAK WAS AN ACCIDENT OF TIMING.
IF ONLY I HAD MOBLEY IN MY CORNER.
HE KNOWS THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
DON'T YOU?
"OH, SURE."
"I KNOW THE HEAD WAITER OF THE STORK,"
"AND THE COLONNIER, AND ""21,"""
"AND I KNOW THE FELLOW AT THE DOG SHOW,"

"KNOWS THE FELLOW AT THE HORSE SHOW,"
AND THE FELLOW AT THE HORSE SHOW
"KNOWS THE PEOPLE AT THE WALDORF,"
"AND THE PEOPLE AT THE WALDORF KNOW ME,"
BUT MOBLEY KNOWS THE RIGHT COPS.
"WELL, MARK, TALK TO HIM."
IT MIGHT DO A GREAT DEAL OF HARM
IF HE RATS ABOUT IT TO GRIFFITH.
DEAR HEART.
"YOU WANT ME TO HAVE THIS JOB, DON'T YOU?"
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK THAT.
THEN GO TO MOBLEY FOR ME.
We'II send you a drink down.

"- Oh, come on, Marc!"
- When did you start using blow?
- I've only done coke once.
- Dad's not talking to mum.

He won't talk to her.
He says he hates her.
Stop fucking up Simon's party.
You're in the VIP Lounge.
What are you drinking?

- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
I have TS.
"Look, uh ..."
Apparently Chan again began distribution.
Muhbirlerimden called me one.
"Chan, followed up to the stadium."

That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."

Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."

Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?

AND A TROUBLED BUT GIFTED SON --
"WELL,THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING."
ENOUGH ABOUT ME -

"NO,I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT."
"YOU KNOW,I DON'T THINK"
THAT WE SHOULD WASTE ALL YOUR HARD WORK.
WHAT SAY WE SPLIT THE FEE?
YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE HE IS.
I WILL DO ALL THE REST.
IT'S EASY MONEY.
"EVELYN,I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS,"
BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY.
COME ON.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO TO PERSUADE YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MIAMI?
"APART FROM YOU,OF COURSE."
THE CHEAP LABOR.
"YOU KNOW,I CAN GET A KID OFF THE STREET"
TO DO A HIT FOR ABOUT A GRAND.
"WELL,IF I FLIRT WITH HIM A LITTLE."
"SAY,NOW,ISN'T THAT LUCY?"
LUCY!
"MICHAEL,I AM SO SORRY."
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
"YES,IT IS."
YOU TAUGHT ME BETTER THAN THAT.
I'M SO STUPID.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGH.
I'VE GOT GUYS HEADED TO HER HOTEL RIGHT NOW.
IT WON'T MATTER.
-I saw our future.

"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.

-It is amazing.
"-Seriously, never saw it."
Do not.

"Brothers and sisters, behold the power of Sven."
On that day I made an oath.
Sven ...
I
I promise to use my powers only for good things.
"For eternity all the time, to create ... eter a new ..."
Is there no end to the power of Sven?
-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
"Look, you give her an inch, she takes a mile."
I think we should stop.
"Oh, babe."
Come on.
Not now.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
I....
I didn't....
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
-You should be with her if you want.
-I don't want to.
I wanna be with you.
-I want you to be with her.
-I can't be with her.
-Why not?
-She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
-She's throwing herself at us.
"-She's throwing herself, I can't do it."
Jane....
"Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend and I won't lay there and watch you do it."
"Oh, who's gonna know?"
I'll know.
-Hey.
What took you so long?
-Sorry.
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

"Chris, can't do what?"
"- Jenna, please."
"- Can't do what, Chris?"
- You should just talk to Michael.
"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?
"Listen, don't ask me any more questions, please."
He should be telling you.

Which girls?

Max passed away.
And he was my best friend.

Yeah.

I will always miss Max.
Of course you will.

"Let's go, but be careful about my little girls."

I moved to the countryside.
"In nature, I found myself."

Come out.
Hi.
Do you know where you are?
You're in a police station.
Do you know who I am?
"I'm Detective Pembleton, Homicide."
You killed eight people.

He's an addict.
I can't rely on him.

Mm-hmm.
But it's up to you.

I have problems with food in my house.
"Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?"
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!
God!
She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!
Where to?
Aren't you ashamed to watch a woman bathing?
!
And where are you going?
"But I'm a girl, too."
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!
Do something.
"You stand and watch, while she falls inside!"
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.
Let me see...
Relax!
I'll ask her!
Aunty!
What has happened?
Nothing.
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.
A blouse?
Did a blouse make so much of noise?
!
Did a blouse make the noise?
What do you think I'd do?
Don't worry.
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
You got it straight?
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.
What stuff?
All you had was your purse.
It won't be long.
Come on in.
Shit!
I'll be back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
She better not have bought any clothes.
What does she have to pack?
-Come on.
-Be careful.
I love you.
Did you spend any of my money?
Fantasia?
Where did she go?
"Police officers, freeze!"
Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor!
Now!
Who the fuck are you?
-You bitch!
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
Very thoughtful of him.
What did you say?
What a spectacular rise!
As of now you have made $120.000.

Oh.
Have you worked for Mrs. Ryan long?
A few months.
Why?

For whom?
For myself.
I'm the prying kind.
"Tell me, my dear."

"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.

"He's in his crib, like you said."
"Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone."
He's not alone.
He has you.
"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.
"But... and if I'm gonna be a good father,"
I've gotta do what's best for him.
I can't fix you.
I can't... make you walk out the front door.
You have to do it yourself.
And I have to let you.
Ow!
Ow!
It's okay...
leave me alone!
Aah!
"Tammy, stop it!"
Ah!
Don't!
Leave me alone.
"I got her. 5 milligrams of lorazepam, now."
What happened?
I don't know.
It came out of nowhere.
No!
Mom's here.
Mom's here.
It hurts.
Papa!
Who spoke up?
Speak louder!
Hail Goddess!
Papa!
Papa!
- Say it again!
Hail Goddess!
I am asking who is making this noise!
Papa!
Papa!
Who is stuck down?
"Papa, I forgot to say that this is a time bomb."
What are you saying?
- What!
"By mistake I got time bomb instead of remote bomb, papa."
Then at what time will it explode?
"Uncle, at 6 o'clock!"
"By the way papa, what's the time?"
Hang on!
Hang on!
30 seconds to 6!
It means one..
- Two..
Three.
"Papa, did the bomb explode?"
"One, two, three."
'Pinto's bomb blasted the diamond..
..And not the people into pieces.'
'Its said that nobody gets anything before the right time..
..And more than what they deserve.'
'Everybody got their share of diamond.'
KELLY:
Hey.
WEXLER:
Hey.

KELLY:
Stand up for you?
Come on.
I can get up.

WEXLER:

KELLY:

I'm under instruction to make this brief.
The drive- through version.
But I want to say how happy I am to be performing this ceremony.
WEXLER:
"I look all right, John?"
- Perfect.
Aces.
"You know, this was her idea."
"I mean, she wanted to do it."
"The kid loves me, so why not do it?"
"Whatever time there is, huh?"
"I'm with you, Jimmy."
"- Are we ready to go, Jimmy?"
"- Yeah, I've been ready for 1 4 years."
- She's the one that's had cold feet.
- Go on.
"Robin Wirkus, do you take Jimmy Wexler to be your lawful wedded husband?"
"Well, let's see."
We got double-A's.
Watch yourself!
Halt!
Who goes there?
Don't shoot!
It's okay.
Friends.
-Do you know these life-forms?
-Yes!
They're Andy's toys.
"All right, everyone, you're clear to come up."
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
"Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!"
"Wh-why, thank you!"
"Now, thank you all for your kind welcome!"
"-Say, what's that button do?"
-I'll show you.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
"Hey, Woody's got something like that."
His is a pull string.
-Only it's...
-Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
"Oh, yeah, but not like this."
This is a quality sound system.
"Probably all copper wiring, huh?"
"So, where you from?"
Singapore?
Hong Kong?
"Well, no."
"Actually, I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four."
Who the bleedin' hell does he think he is?
- Who the bleeding heck do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
- Johnnie!
That's it.
There you go.
"Thank you, Grandad."
"You deserve a medal, mate."
Johnnie.
- Johnnie.
Johnnie.
- Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I'm Rose.
This is the Nancy.
Rose.
The propeller's snarled.
If I-
- If I can just cut it free--
Just pretend you're Errol Flynn.
He can do anything.
I've cut it free.
- She's moving.
"Come on, you beauty."
- She'll do it.
"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back."
"There's no mister, and back home, they call me Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
- Tell me one thing.
It's from Naples.
- From Naples?
"- Yes, yes."
Every last hair.
Who gave you this?
"Where'd you get it, Jimmy?"
Where have you been hanging out?
Tell me who gave you this.
"Jimmy, come here."
Come here.
Forgive me.
Excuse me.
I'd like to...
I'm looking for...
- Maria Concetta.
- What is it you want?
She has a brother...
Pasqualino.
There are thousands of Maria Concettas and Pasqualinos around here.
"Wait, maybe he's talking about the virgin."
"- Oh, the virgin?"
- Yes.
Her father doesn't know.
"Ah, her father doesn't know."
"Wait, I'll come with you."
I'll come with you.
- Thank you.
"- Antonio, and you?"
See if he'll give me a couple of dollars.
- Here.
- Thanks.
"- Wait here, I'll be right back."
What the hell happened in there?
Nothing.
"It was a little messy,"
That's all.
What the hell?
Who are you?
You bill?
"No, no I'm not bill."
"Oh, you must be otis."
Otis?
Who the hell is otis?
"Goddamn it, Sean."
You're nacho.
"That's right, asshole."
Who the hell was that?
I think that was my new
Boyfriend.
"What's going on, officer?"
A man wearing a tee-Shirt
That had a ladder 62 FDNY logo
On it doubleparked over at the
"Supermarket, and he, uh, I don't"
"Know how else to say this, he"

He was really scary.
"And he told me, told me I should"
Lose weight.

"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?

I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."

"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.

They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.

Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.
- Don't you say hi?

You got friends now?
Come on.
This is true.
"This is true, Roldy."
Ooh wee
"- Man, this is so not like me."
- Yeah.
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
"Better, faster, stronger."
Nice.
"Man, I've never used a sick day before."
"I'm taking a whole week off from work here, man."
"And in less than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam."
- This is nuts.
This is nuts.
"- I know, dude."
"It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip, only it's not gonna suck."
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.
Dude.
"Dude, this chick's giving me such a boner, it's awesome."
Thank you.
You ruined the moment.
"She's all yours, buddy."
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
"No, that's--"
Enjoy.
Just a minute.
Fuc--
"Hey, hey."
Let me in.
What are you doing?
You suppose-a something else.
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.
I don't have any hand soap here.
You got anything in the kitchen I could use?
Go use the station john.
I'd just get it dirty.
I'll tell him to get you some the next time he goes in.
Sorry to bother you.
You want a cup of coffee?
"Yeah, thanks."
"A nice place you got here, Mrs. Papadukis."
Papadakis.
"Oh, yeah."
Sorry.
Papadakis.
"What are you, Greek or somethin'?"
What...do I look Greek to you?
No.
Thanks.
So what do I call ya?
I guess you can call me Cora.
"A man, every man, needs to have a home."
"-You travel, huh?"
-Sure.
It's okay.
"But you know, the time come...."
The time come!
"Close the door, it is windy."
"Cora, give the man some wine."
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
"-Nice coffee, Missus."
Access granted.
"All right, Project Cadmus."
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.
"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?
We didn't come for a play date.
[SIR ENS WAIL ING]
-Help !
-Get us down!
Stay put.
We will get you out.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Whoa-

We need a plan.
We--
-Robin?
Are you OK?
"You, of all people, drive me home!"
- To ease my guilty conscience.
"- Oh, dear."
Everybody else was completely drunk.
Theo?
Go to sleep.
As the moisture flowed into droplets...
- Slaving away again?
- What?
What are you doing?
Surprise.
I moved out of my apartment.
- You agreed.
- I told you.
I had to talk to Laura first.
It's her house.
- But there's so much space here.
- Yeah...
But you're not very easy on her.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
"You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it."
That's mutual.
Exactly.
"A great basis, huh?"
Shit.
- You aren't pleased.
"- Yes, I am."
"Yes, I am."
Really.
"I'll talk to Laura later, OK?"
Ooh!
Hey!
"Ooh, what a lovely...cocoa tin lid!"
It doesn't matter what it is.
It's...
It's symbolic.
It's meaningful.
"Oh, meaningful."
The only thing I know about cocoa is it's very good at bedtime.
-
"- Language, Julie!"
-
- Morning!
"Packet of Jelly Tots, please."
I wouldn't stand too near the assistant manager.
You might get a nipple in the eye!
-
- Doesn't he like you dressed like that?
-
- I'm not dressed unless I wear a pinny.
I'm not giving in this time.
-
- I think you look terrific!
-
- You do?
-
- Thanks!
-
- Hey!
I'm over here!
Really?
Do you really think I look terrific?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?

"Yeah, I'm fine."

"A way with the truth, right."
"Listen, if you're asking me if it's too..."
Too late?
"It's never that, Mr. Fallin."
Never.
Never that.
"So, you want to-- you want to stay?"
- Yes.
- Good.
Good.
Thank you.
"She's, um-- she's really excited about this dance."
"A night out with you, a new dress."
She's really excited.
Do you want to call me Dad or Jim?
Dad.
I think Dad's nice.
Yeah.
And you?
"Um, are you Samantha or Sam?"
He and his men are the front line.
He's in charge of this.
Whether you like it or not.
"Igor here, they're coming out."
- Headed for the cars.
- Gotcha.
"Big Luc here, they're coming out."
Two black SUV's and a Mercedes.

And the rest?
- I only see Boulanger.
- The SUV's are off.
They're taking off.
The SUV's are leaving.
Very slowly.
I see them.
They just passed us.
Let 'em leave the area.
Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.
"We tail Horn, Boulanger, the chick."
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.
I repeat: don't hit 'em here!
The SUV's are stopped at the entrance.
- Horn and the chick are out.
- We'll be OK.
Armed to the teeth.
Where's he going?
Eve to Dennis.
What's up?
What are the orders?

Him?
"Dude, I swear."
Thank you so much.
What would have happened if you hadn't showed up.
"Sorry, sorry."
Shiv.
Nice to meet you.
It feels as if we go way back.
Me?
"No, people generally feel so."
But it isn't so.
"So, why are you being so intense?"
"Okay, we are childhood buddies."
Happy?
We are childhood buddies.
Happy?
Okay?
Sorted?

"Good day, sir!"
"Marshal, this way please!"
Who asked you to come in?
Lock him up!
"You agree with me, Marshal?"
Marshal...
What?
You're the Marshal?
It looks like a love triangle...
He was murdered by his enemy!
Brilliant!
Could it be the White Tiger?
After my careful observation...
No?
It's for the better.
"I'm tied down for a week, so I'll just stay put here and write."
"Mr. Director, you are wonderful."
Does it hurt?
A little.
"Damn it, this sucks."
Hello.
- Did you like the food yesterday?
"- Yes, it was delicious."
I'd like to order the soup again.
"Sure, but how's the movie director?"
He's still in pain.
- Hope he recovers soon.
- So do I.
- It'll be ready in a moment.
- Okay.
What's this?
"Oh, that?"
It's a cane.
Why?
Do you need it?
Is anyone using it?
We don't use it anymore.
My husband used it way back.
"If you need it, take it."
"Oh, thank you."
You're welcome.

"Now, why would you tell your mom about a giant robot, slugger?"
"Say, what'd you see at the power station?"
"Huh, tiger?"

Been in the forest lately?

You know you won't jump.

"Albert, help me."
Help me!
"Albert, I want the Tower of Pisa."
"Albert, I want it big."
I want it big.
Too much noise.
"Albert, for the first time   you're..."
I wanna be fucked.
(Camilla giggles)
It's a log.
- What?
- Fawlty!
"What are you talking about, you silly little man?"
What is going on here?
"I ask him for my room, and he tells me the manager's a Mr. Watt, aged 40."
No.
"No, no."
Faw-lty.
"""Faulty""?"
What's wrong with him?
"It's all right, Mrs. Richards."
He's from Barcelona.
The manager's from Barcelona?
"No, no, no."
He's from Swanage.
- And you're in 22.
- What?
You're in room 22.
"Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?"
"Very nice stay, Mr. Fawlty."
"Ah, glad you enjoyed it."
"Polly, would you get Mr. Firkin's bill, please?"
When will we see you again?
"Oh, not for a few weeks."
"You're not by any chance a betting man, Mr. Fawlty?"
"Er... well, I used to be."
Only there's a very nice little filly running at Exeter this afternoon.
- Really?
- Dragonfly.
Ah.
- Dragonfly?
- Yeah.
-Tweedles.
-Alice.
"-How do you do, again?"
-Where's the rabbit?
How is it you're being so great big?
"She ain't great big, this is how she normal is."
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
"No, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?"
"Oh, yeah."
-Where's the rabbit?
-BOTH:
Over theres.
-MALLY:
What are you doing here?
-I'm rescuing the Hatter.
I'm rescuing the Hatter.
He told me that the Vorpal sword is hidden in the castle.
Help me find it.
"I don't take orders from big, clumsy, galumphing..."
Shoo!
"-What is it, McTwisp?"
-I know where the sword is.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The sword's hidden inside.
"Be careful, Alice."
I know that smell.
(SNORING)
I'm not going in there.
Look what that thing did to my arm.
"Dear, oh, dear."
Why haven't you mentioned this?
It wasn't this bad before.
Come on.
"Should I help him along, Dad?"
"You know your dad, God bless his Irish soul..."
He was...
How shall I put it?
He was sort of killed.
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.
Tell Tommy.
"Come on, tell him!"
Don't move or I'll fucking kill you!
Son of a bitch.
Jimmy!
Get up!
Get up!
- I'll kill you.
- I'm your son.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
"- Vince, no!"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
"But it's over now, because we're going in... together."
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
- He's a thief.
- Meantime I'II report him.
- He's gone.
- Afugitive?
"- No, he checked out."
He popped off.
- He croaked.
- I don't understand.
- Dead.
- Great start!
- Take me to a hotel.
- I didn't get that.
There must be a hotel around.
"This time of year, at this hour?"
.
You razzin' me?
Okay.
Is there much more to walk?
Want me to carry it?
Come in.
It's kind of you to host me.
"please, this way."
Mr. Director...
Take your shoes off.
My mother's fanatical about dirt.
Watch your step.
Go ahead in.
"I'II camp out on the couch, I can't stay here."
I'II move the box.
"I'II get you settled, change the sheets too."
You shouldn't...
"It's moth balls, Mom puts them everywhere."
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
"No, no, no!"

And that's your daughter?
Yes.
I know you're still good inside.
I know you want to help us.
You don't know anything about me.
Please!

I can't just leave to North Dakota!
- We have to be there Friday.
- Or what?
All done.
- That was it?
"- See, I told you I'm good."
"- No, don't worry, it's not permanent."
- Um...
Okay.
"What is this, like, some kind of memory test or something like that?"
- You'll find out.
"- Oh, okay."
You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.
"Oh, okay."
Commencing at 5:38.

Nearly there.
I thought I turned that off.

You have never experienced it.
"- Monna, tell her to try it."
You have to taste it.
"Yes, is..."
But it hurts.
"- Thank you very much, but..."
She barked and tossed it.
She does not like the queue.
"I do not like it, but you're sitting on mine."
My dear friend.
Go straight and then left.
"Right, right."
"Sorry, right."
"Nice, huh?"
"Oh, fuck."

He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.

Seriously?
"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
The motel?
"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.
What?
"I do whatever I want, whenever I want."
It's perfect.
"Yeah, but... don't you miss your dad?"
Yo!
Sammy!
That's your brother with Amanda Heckerling?
He's cool.
Yeah.
He thinks so.
"Hey, tough guy."
I been looking for you.
Don't blame me if there's an accident!
Make way!
Make way!
Thank you!
"Brother, help me!"
Someone is trying to kill me!
"Brother, someone is trying to kill me!"
Can you hear me?
Damn it!
He's deaf.
You've got to answer my questions honestly.
- Do you know the deceased?
- Yes.
- I don't know him.
- What does he do here?
- He helps the actors dress.
- I don't know.
"Sir, the Marshal has arrived."
Fall in!
Attention!
"Marshal, at your service!"
"Marshal, this way, please!"
I said inside.
How dare you go in without an invitation!
Teach him a lesson!
Marshal...
Loser.
"Yes, Marshal."
What?
You're the Marshal!
"Reporting for duty, sir!"
Full-gun salute.
See you later.
"Well, John, I gave you back the life of that little girl but I'm not sure that I can let you walk out that door because you killed my son."
What are you waiting for?
"Gentlemen, please, this is a house of God."
Family.
"John, it's all about family."
I know.
And you took mine away from me.
[groans]
(Porter) Please!
Please.
[loud groan]
"You know, I just cannot give shit kickings the way I used to."
"(Porter) Please, leave."
Leave!
"Well, priest, you're in the wrong place."
I'm sorry.
Boys.
"May I read a prayer first, please?"
Make it fast.
"(John) Go ahead, Father."
"Chapter 11, verse 32."
"""And the Lord God said--"""
(Armant) Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Shoot that prick.
[gunshots]
"Stop running, John."
Shoot him!
[gunshots]
Shoot him.
Goddammit!
"- Thanks, madam."
Beto...
Tomorrow I'll come to talk to you.
"- All right, madam."
Merry Christmas.
The new owners will move in next week.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
"I want to help you, but I don't know how."
I don't want to leave.
You could remarry.
"I can't live with anybody, I am a weird man."
So many years have passed.
"- Yes, madam, 30."
"Can you please leave me alone, Beto?"
"Yes, madam."
"Hello, Too."
"Fine, and you?"
I am calling to ask you for a favour.
Can you get a job for Beto?
"Yes, we all feel the same."
"Yes, I'll do that."
Of course.
I send you a kiss.
Bye.
One moment.
We'd better go.
Hello?
"Hey, Lupe!"
Why?
Right.
Can't someone else go?
"Yeah, good enough."
-And What do you think caused it?
Trafficking in war.
"The League-Z has dangerous friends, there will be revenge."
-The Motorcycle club is a Balkan mafia?
-This Is a very fast response.
Anything is possible.
Myself loose!
-And Here comes Hamit Milonkovic.
Quiet!
-Do You!
Let myself go!
-There Are people in there!
-It's My restaurant!
I have employees there!
I do not know how many.
Lars!
She was missing?
-14-15 Years.
Eurasian appearance.
Where is she?
-Estava Here.
Who would be interested in harming you?
I have no idea.
You heard what happened in Mysen?
-With Ferrymen?
-What Your relationship with them?
I have nothing to do with it.
A girl was rescued.
It has something to do with you?
Nita?
It's okay.
Yes.
She must have cracked our plan!
Everything's gone!
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.
We have to catch her now.
That is important.
Okay.
Go...
Stop.
- Why are you stopping the car?
Who are you?
- Quick.
"- Sadhana, go."
I'm a cop.
We are in a hurry chasing an accused!
I'm a cop.
- This person is seriously injured!
It's an important case.
At least tell us where the hospital is.
It's within a kilometer.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go fast!
"Is everything okay, Alphonse?"
Yes.
But you keep following them properly.
"Madam, speed up."
Please.
What's happening there?
Nothing.
You keep tracking.
[SIGHS]
"History test next period, we're studying."
"Come on, baby, she means nothing to me."
Don't be mad.
"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe, underneath your whole I-could-give-a-crap-bad-boy thing that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like, the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
You spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool but it's just an act.
"We both know that you're just a sad, lonely little kid."
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.
I'm a hero.
A hero.
What?
What?
GIRL 1:
Good job.
BOY 1:
"Hey, way to go, Sam."
BOY 2:
"Good job, buddy."
BOY 3:
"Yeah, nice job, Winchester."

BOY 5:
"Nice, Sam."
"Tonino, daddy's boy!"
"- Darling, how are you?"
Fine.
- Are you OK?
"Are you OK, love?"
Mario!
- Quirino!
"Mario, you're already out?"
"Damn, that sucks."
"No, I mean I'm glad."
"Hi, Tonino."
- What did you do?
Nothing.
A classic case of mistaken identity.
I'll get a lawyer right away.
- A lawyer?
Are you crazy?
"I'll defend myself, instead send me some goodies."
"Bye, cutie."
- Let's go.
- Remember: no lawyers!
Bye.
"- Croquettes, cigarettes and sweets!"
Poor guy.
- Are you sure that it's a case of mistaken identity?
"Who knows, it happens a lot."
Just look at me.
"By the way, Counselor, we're going to have rename Tonino."
Why?
- Too many Tonino De Santises.
"True, it can happen."
- He's right.
No!
"No,that's perfect."
Hmm?
Yeah.
Hey!
Hi!
"Oh,sorry."
Do you know your friend here is a pervert?
"A $60 Brazilian wax and he's grossed out, but yet Neosporin and scabs are apparently really enticing."
"Baby,I would do you if you had Bella's mole."
I just don't like it when you mess with yourself.
"You guys,you have to come tonight."
You have to.
Johnny's got a gig.
"And you're thinking if he meets your friends,he'll dump you."
"No,I'm thinking it'll make him happy and I want to be supportive."
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Come here.
Hmm?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Whoo-oo!
I hope he sings that song about star-shine.
Whoo!
This first song is for a very special woman in my life.
"Bella,put your hand up."
I want everyone to see who you are.
"- Aw, I do like you."
My name is Murray Cornish.
I remember that.
- Do you?
- You're very charming.
- You think I'm going to -

"Yes, I like you."
I like you too.
"You know, you're not making me too fishy."
I'm
- I'm with everything -
I don't let it go down.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Are you going to live with us?
- Here?
- Yeah.
"Well, maybe someday I might."
- Not yet.
- Not yet.
It's not my time yet.
[Vocalizing]
"You could come in with me... with I, uh -with all our guys."
They'd like you.
But I would like you.
[Chuckling]
Murray's on the way.

Half of that.
"D'Artagnan, this came earlier."
Porthos!
It's a letter from Treville.
"We have to meet General Verdet's aide in Bourgogne, and escort him back to Paris."
He has news from the front.
What now?
"No, not now, go to sleep."
The war will wait.
"Wait, check you out."
"Girl, you ain't all churchgoing goody two shoes."
Look at that frumpy old church.
"It moved, God moved."
"Shut up, puta."
"Kike, please!"
What the fuck.

Oh...

That's my son.
No...

"Kike, listen."
No.
You didn't notice your shit was missing?
"Don't blame me for this, E.!"
What the fuck were you doing this whole time?
"I was working, pendejo!"
"Where were you, huh?"
Tough guy?
No.
Where were you?
"Angie, you don't get it."
The shit that...
Goes down behind those walls.
You can't understand.
"And here, my son wants to be like this."

Whose cigarette is that?
"Oh, Mary save us!"
They're repulsive.
Pamela.
"I'm not Pamela, I'm Sister Mary Maude."
What's with the Irish accent?
- I don't know.
"- Oh, you're a nun?"
With an MA in classical languages.
"Oh, I get it!"
The old split personality defence.
Classic.
- I don't know what you mean.
- She's lying.
All Right.
Would you also like to test me Greek?
"- This is not gonna work, Pamela."
- Stop calling me Pamela.
"Pamela, Pamela."
Pamela.
"Have another cigarette, Pamela."

"Well, promise me you'll never go away again."
Mama's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
"Hey, is that a big-boy tooth I see in there?"
"I twisted it 134 times, and then it came out during all-school assembly."
Oh.
Hm.
- What did the tooth fairy bring you?
"- A bow and arrow, a new pair of Converse, $1.50 and a Monster Flashlight."
- All under your pillow?
"- Well, I got the best tooth fairy in town."
Sounds like it.
Pour your own.
How did you get all that stuff under his pillow?
"Well, I picked up a few tricks from the other moms."

"I can't, Tommy."
"Jesus, it's been years."
Course you can.
You've a gorgeous voice.
Please.
For me.
Not like that.
Do it properly.
Like you did in Wicklow.
"Now, go on."
"You're a menace, Tommy Cassidy."

He's got the anti-warvote.
"Or he'll steal it, like his brother."
"Bobby's a mean little son of a bitch, Edgar."
He had the I.R.S. Auditmy mother when she was dying in the nursing home.
Why my place of origin?
Somewhere else ok?
"Up to you, just be 500m away from Lisa."
"Michael,"
I know what you're thinking.
You want me to stay away from Lisa cos you are not confident.
Good morning Mr. Lin.
Morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Thanks David.
It's my duty.
Good morning Mr. Mak.
You didn't drown?
"No, thanks for your concern."
You're such a dog.
Really?
It's my duty.

Goodbye.
You don't like him?
I don't like you too.
Just 3 weeks.
"After breakfast, I'll change and set off."
Going home to nap.

I don't like to sleep.
What if you fall asleep during investigation?
Wake me up.
Hey!
What?
Driving 2 cars is a waste?
Expect me to sit in your car?
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.
Where can I phone from?
Do you have a mobile?
"Well, me and mobiles..."
There's a phone kiosk over there.
"It's my office, but you can use it."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"Sophie, it's Mum."
No.
I'm still at the office.
"Yes, I know it's late."

"Really, really fun."

"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.
Next time let's not dwell on Matt.
"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"
Yeah.

Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.

"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
YOU'RE DOING THE BEST THING.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
"I'VE STAYED, AND I'VE LEFT."
SOMETIMES LEAVING IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
"IT MUST BE LONELY, WHAT YOU DO."
I COULDN'T LIVE THAT WAY.
"IN MY LINE OF WORK,"
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET TOO CLOSE.
WHAT IF YOU MET SOMEONE...
AND THERE'S A SPARK?
WOULD YOU IGNORE IT?
COULD YOU?
"I WOULD, UH..."
CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE JOB DONE.
I GOT TO HEAD OVER TO DOUG'S.
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.
OKAY.
"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG, SAM?"
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR TOUCH?
I DIDN'T KNOW DOUG WOULD HAVE A NINE-PIN DIMPLE LOCK --
"YOU KNOW, THE NEW KIND, THE KIND I HAVEN'T PRACTICED ON?"
"OKAY, MY FINGERS ARE BLEEDING NOW."
THERE'S SOME PAIN INVOLVED.
"YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE"
WITH BARS ON ITS WINDOWS.
I WONDER WHAT DOUG WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.
"COME ON, BABY."
THERE BETTER BE SOMETHING GOOD IN HERE.
THERE WE GO.
GOT IT.
LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH.
I'VE WORKED WITH LESS.
Get the fuck off me.
-Get off of Jacob.
Get off him.
I was supposed to protect him.
She's taking him to houston.
Fuck that bitch.
"Come on, man, get up."
Let's get outa here.

You finished?
Yeah.
Alright.
I saw your probation report signed on your bed.
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back at Barker sooner than you thought.
I'm real proud o'you.
'You hear what I said?
Yeah.
What?
"I don't know, you just ...."
You look like her sitting there.
We made a great team didn't we?
The four of us.

"Hey Wes, get up."
Come on.
What are you doing here?
"Hurry up, pack your things let's go."
Why?
We're leaving.

"Hi, this is Ken."
"I'm out right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get..."
Could I get the check?
"Say, I was wondering, if I checked out a day early, would I still get all my Extended Rest rewards points for the entire stay?"
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
- Watch your step here.
- I will.
"Those plants, they don't look nice anymore."
- They're okay.
"- Hey, where are we going, anyway?"
"- Uh, I'm gonna take you to the doctor."
Unless they've got a special job like you.

"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."

I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.

- Isn't he.

No.
No more talking.
No more lies.
No more lies ever again.

Don't leave me.
"Come back here, you bitch."

Okay.
Bo.
Stay back!
What's going on?
What the hell just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.
As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.

"Well, since my family has a cake shop..."
I think I'll be fine.
"Rather, I can finally show my performance."
Performance?
Eh?
What?
"- Ah, nothing."
"Ah, hey."
Can we meet on the 14th?
Valentine's day.
I'm a bit busy on the 14th...
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Well, that's right."
"A guy shouldn't be asking you out on that day, right?"
Sorry.
"Then, the 13th?"
- That's fine.
"Ah, thank goodness."
"Then, the 13th."
- Yeah.
"Then, on the 13th."
Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I'll text you later, okay?"
Bye bye.
"- Yeah, bye..."
I feel like I've been casually rejected...
"Oh, that's right."
The place was bad.
Your answers?
Beaufort and...
I heard you say it.
"Beaufort and Bath, that's what you said."
Yes.
"So, Beaufort is there..."
Show me your first letters.
"And presumably, Bath..."
But that doesn't work.
That doesn't work.
You haven't found the right answers.
I'm going to throw it over to Araucarians for a bonus point?
We think it's Beaufort and Minton.
"Beaufort and Minton, show me your first letters."
Let's see if you're right?
I know you're not.
It is Beaufort and Badminton.
ALL:
Oh!
"Oh, it's so obvious now!"
"The Badminton Horse Trials, of course."
The Horse Trials are held on the estate every year.
Araucarians.
Reveal the hive.
Wojtyla?
Erm...
No.
"Too obvious, isn't it?"
Or is Ratzinger...?
No.
"Yes, Ratzinger's in there."
Is he in there?

You better catch them for me!
What are you doing here!
Line up!
Go!

Open the door!
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.

I don't care about those old diamonds--
"Merle, let's go back to the house."
"Merle, my dear child..."
"Olivia, your aunt--"
Mr. Drake told me.
Somebody stole Grandmother's diamonds.
"But it doesn't matter, Uncle Howard."
"I'm afraid it's more serious than that, Merle."
Your Aunt Olivia is dead.
She's been murdered.
"You warned her, didn't you, Cousin Julian?"
You said somebody would cut her throat.

We'll need our copter to get the baby out.
The canyon is all jammed up.
"Negative, 7 Mary 4."
The CHP helicopter is halfway to Palm Springs on a blood run.
Sheriff has a chopper out of Malibu.
Let's get it!
"10-23, 7 Mary 4."
This is CHP to Station B.
- How's it going?
- Hang in.
I'm trying to get a chopper.
"7 Mary 4, negative on the sheriff's helicopter."
It's at Aero Bureau in Long Beach.
Its ETA would be 20 minutes.

"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.

"I mean, ok."
Attaboy.

"Yes, yes, speaking."
What?
"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."
"So, that's it for now."
Keep playing lotto!
You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."

YOU'D BETTER STAND ON IT YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"HE MEANS IF THE OLD MAN DIDN'T KILL HER,"

ANY NEWSPAPER THAT USES YOUR WIRE SERVICE

"Oh, come on, mum!"
Really?
"That's not helping, isn't it?"
"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."

"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."

What's going on?
Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
Understood.
"Yankee, can you see it?"
Yes.
Do it!
Dropping hellfire.
Started!
Shit!
"How's that, bastard!"
You draw his attention!
"Ram, shoot!"
Shut up!
The GONKU is now inoperative.
Every one.
Good job.
What happened?
Hey!
As expected... it's underground.
Let's work.
Here is today's crucial moment.
"Good night, this is Tokyo Rose."
Your jokes are hard to understand.
Receiving you clear.
Yankee.
From now on we will split and start the search.
Ram and Male search east side.
Ok.
We will turn to the west.
Understood.
Are you going to search with Male's RC?
Right?
It's just for precaution.
I know...
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.

You're okay.
I love you so much.
The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"

What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
-No!
Is it wrong?

I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!

What is your location?
Dark Sensations in the Bronx.
I wish you were here.
Mr. Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
"Oh, Pete got fired this morning."
That's so weird that you don't know that.
[Cheers and applause]
LIZ:
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?
!
Hell no!
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
"You know, I moved from Chicago for this."
From Chicago?
I was in Scottie Pippin's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
- What did the admiral say?
- Say?
About Harvey.
No objection.
"After all, it's the custom."
- Time to find your sea legs.
- Thank you.
- Get your things.
We'll get settled.
- I'm ready.
Harvey.
"Sorry, Mother."
"Goodbye, my dear."
Look after yourself.
"- Goodbye, Mother."
- Wait for me below.
- He'll find things a bit different.
- He's only 12.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
How long this time?
A year?
"- Less, perhaps."
"- Only ""perhaps""?"
- I hate goodbyes on the jetty.
- I know what you'll say.
- So I'll take my leave now.
- You left me days ago when you caught sight of the sea.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
God keep you both.
- What do you think of her?
'Course it does.
You bugger.
Mam!
Wait!

Who?
Him.
Nothing.
He said he'd given me a ball or something.
A ball?
He didn't say to come with him or anything?
To Canada?
No.
No.
"Because you're staying with me, aren't you?"
"Mam, can we play the record?"
No.
I told you.
But why?
Because I don't want to hear it!
Now fasten it up.
"You don't get it out, you don't show it anybody, and you don't tell anybody."
I mean it.
"She said, ""Pop in."""
She wants me to pop in.
"I'm not making this up, am I?"
"She wants me, Tubby Baker, to come and see her in her office."
"Got to mean something, hasn't it?"
Ooh.
"One, two."
And...
"# In this grove, in this grove"
So what's up?

Hello.
Thomas.
- I should've known.
I am no longer your psychologist.
Globale blamed you for all this?
No.
Not directly.
They replaced me by Dr Moreau.
They can.
With no reason.
But the girl was...
Eva?
- Yes.
Eva.
What will happen to her?
She was transferred to another sector.
less demanding of her body.
- What?
Another sentence of substitution.
but a longer one.
What does it consist in?
I can't tell you.
Thomas.
Globale forbids you to have any contact with her.
And it's best.
Where is she?
You must tell me.
Listen.
you know.
when we were waiting for the insurance experts.
Listen to this.
I'm really sorry.
"If you give me your number, I'll call ya and bring the money to ya."
I don't take I.O.U.'s from guys that I just met.
Forty bucks.
"Oh, wait."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
How 'bout this?
What's that?
"Hundred dollar five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, Lions."
From the Montecito.
Huh?
- No way the Rams cover.
You kidding?
- I owe you 40.
"This thing pays, you'll get two grand, man."
Come on.
Come on!
Give us a break.
Start betting on Korean Ping-Pong.
And get out of here.
"All right, fine."
All right.
It's me.
So what?
I don't know anything about fake chips.
You don't know anything about fake chips?
You cashed it in.
This isn't fair.
No.
"- It isn't fair, is it?"
- It wasn't even my chip.

-You brought this on yourself.
LARSON:
"You cost me my job, you prick!"
"Hey, Roy, take this outside the station house, okay?"
"Go outside, get it off your chest."
Better than doing it here.
"I'm gonna kick his ass, then your ass."
"If we go, we're gonna go."
Hell of a fall.

"Okay, people, come on."

Understood.
Dropping the hellfire.
Yankee... that's all?
Yes.
"It's a GUNK, isn't it?"
Everyone listen!
Gimlet here.
The bombing failed.
The enemy is getting closer.
As shown on the screen it's a self-supported tank.
"But, we will proceed as in practice."
I will move to position too.

This guy is Superman.
"Sure, he's famous now..."
... buthestartedoff justlike you.
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"That's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not Iike you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.
"You're hungry, aren't you?"
But I don't have any metal here.

The land of emperors should be right here.
"You are crazy,"
I'm sure the land of emperors is there.
Not here.
My God!
"Then, no!"
"Look, someone got out."
"They saw, I knew there was a way out."
"-Friend, how we get out?"
I do not know.
-I am trying to get.
"-Mano, Mano!"
"-Hey, Dad!"
"-Atticus, my good boy"
-See you all well.
What happened?
A huge iceberg came tumbling and rolling and here we are.
This is terrible.
"Nothing that would not to give way, baby."
-Mama!

-For he knew they were good.
-Where's Mommy?
Has anyone seen the glory?
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
"- Hey, guess what."
- They want Lily to skip fifth grade.
"Traditionally, the person who says ""guess what"""
also gets to say the what.
Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
"- I mean, there's proof of that?"
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
"They asked Alex to skip a grade, too..."
"- It's not a competition, Claire."
- ... but we felt... that it would be too much stress to have her with kids so much older.
- Good for Lily!
- Yeah.
"I just always thought she was, you know..."
- So did we.
Yeah.
- Us too.
Yeah.
- How was your big night with Javier?
- (groans)
I overindulged.
- Booze or burgers?
- Booze.
"I drank so much, I had an angry slap fight"
- with what turned out to be a mirror.
- (chuckles)
Gloria:
Do I hear my Manny?
Fitz.

She goes through my pockets some nights.
"Oh, absolutely."
Which horse?
"- Uh, Dragonfly."
- When's it running?
"No, it ran today."
I won that on it.
Oh.
"Well done, old boy."
"No, could you keep it?"
"No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you..."
"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"

Have you called them yet?
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.

"-Okay, okay."
"-...two, three."
"Now go, go, go."
Ryan?
"Ryan, are you okay?"
"Yeah, yeah."
-You?
-Yeah.
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--
"Oh, my God."
Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.
"-Oh, no, no, no."
It's just glitter.

"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
"Uh, yeah."
Sure.
Hi.
I know.
Brian's here.
Relax.
"All I said was ""Hi""."
Are you gonna bite my head off if I ask you how you are?
"I had a great time in Bali on my non-honeymoon,"
- and tomorrow I start working.
- That's good.
But Brian is here.
"Yeah, well, wasn't that how you guys planned it?"
"Adam, who are you blaming here?"
Marjorie or Brian?
I'm not blaming anybody.
"I'm just... trying to move on with my life, Nicole."
That's all.
"Yo, Adam."

"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."

Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.

I see.
I might add one thing.
"If I did know where your wife was, you are the last one I would tell."
Why don't you leave her alone now;
MAN:
"Come on, kid, get up."
I'll give you a thousand bucks.
Get him over.

"Come on, Brock."

A Major Warning.

Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides.
I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes.
I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love.
If you loved me.
you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait.
Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
- He is not much more than a cloud.
I'll come back to you.
I'll never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
All I have left is a show of strength.
"Besides, women like that sort of thing."
Are you insane?
Pretty dress.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?"
And... one.

Too bad!
Help us lift him.
Wait!
Come back!
I knew it!
It's the frail one!
"Oh, my God!"
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
Fucking Kraut!
What was that?
Fucking Kraut.
Idiot!
"Only for buses, sir."
-I'll be right back.
"No access for normal cars, sir."
Don't be a nag.
There's plenty of space.
Only buses.
"Drop dead, asshole."
"Yes, one more for my husband."
Everything will be ready when you come back.
Stop!
Take him away!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Check if we have these people in the computer.
"If not, ask who we do have."
Just the addresses.
Is it urgent?
-A matter of life and death.
I'll be gone all afternoon.
The money.
"Here, fifty thousand."
Take it.
I already bought jenever on the black market.
"You're a good girl, thanks."
"Seriously, you're a sweety plunge."
Unlike some people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
"Truth or Dare, everyone?"
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've already been over it."
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gum?"
"Truth, probably."
"Uh... ""True, probably."""
So truth.
Be nice.
"So, Felix..."
Tell me...
"If you had a golden ticket, and you could pick any girl, or any guy,"
"to take upstairs for a very quick making fast, no question asked, so,"
who would it be?
"In fact, here it is... your free shag ticket."
"Who is the lucky girl, Felix?"
"Who is it, Felix?"
"Who is the lucky girl, Felix?"
I'm sorry.
I want to play.
"I want to play, come on."
"Come on, let's play."

"Her daughter, son?"
"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."
"We're,like,at..."
Wilson's.
Hey.
I totally wasn't waiting for you.
My sister's car got towed.
Right.
Johnny!
"What's up,brother?"
"- Good show tonight,man."
"- Thanks,brother."
"- See you tomorrow,Johnny."
- Johnny.
"Yeah,the show was great."
"Your musical tastes have changed a bit,huh?"
"Oh,yeah,I guess you can't really sing along to the new stuff,huh?"
"I don't sing,remember?"
- Yeah.
I do.
- I noticed you're rocking the eyeliner now.
What's up with that?
"What,you don't like it?"
I dig it.
"It's just,I..."
"I admire that you can do the ""in the eye"" thing."
It makes me look like Boy George.
"Yeah,well,uh  you never needed any help drawing attention to your eyes."
"So,how's..."
"It was good to see you,Bella."
- Oh.
Okay.
- Take care.
Bye.
"- MORNING, SAM."

Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This may hurt a bit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
There we go.

That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!
- l need you now!
- Now?
You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?
I wouldn't do that!
People hold cars in high esteem.
They show certain signs of concern when they lose them.
Martin!
-Martin!

"One moment, the boss has a meeting."
I'm asking for sick leave.
Immediately.
Now before the symposium?
You've gone crazy!
And what about the report?
Do you have the report for me?
-Well...
"-Yes, or no?"
-No?
-I'm sorry.
It'll be all right.
Sorry.
-Yansky!
-Good bye!
"Martin, what's going on?"
You won't even look at me?
You have a nice hat.
"Yes, yes, Doctor Yansky."
"Decent, truthful,"
"responsible,"
So send him to a psychiatrist.
Life is beautiful.
-I know.
-So what's missing in your life?
It's not missing.
It's excessive.
The one from Sophia?
"- No, why?"
"Okay, never mind."
Thank you.
- Sure.
Sanchez.
"- Detective, it's Danny Ferman."
Hi.
"- Danny boy, how are you?"
I'm good.
Thank you.
"Did you guys call my office to pull,"
Sophia's voicemail off my machine?
Maybe.
We do that.
I'll look into it.
"Oh, and by the way, tox came back on her."
OD'd like I said.
- Okay.
We got a statement from the neighbor.
Russian woman.
A real character.
"- Yeah, I saw her last night."
"She said she saw a man stop by at the vic's early in the day, but no sign of a struggle."
"My gut says they were either shooting up together, or he was a dealer."
- She give a description?
Vague.
She said it was a white guy.
Big.
Really big.
That's it?
- That's it.
- Your wives.
- Yeah.
Commitment.
You have to care.
You're not going to stir?
- Stir?

"My omelette, my way."
OK.
"Your PSAs, your porters they're your family."
Why won't you give one of 'em a break?

- We all fail.
You failed at marriage.
- Twice.
Someone gave you a third chance.
- I didn't do drugs.
"Frank, all I'm asking, as a colleague, as a friend..."
And it's still no.
What are you doing here?
You're not on graveyard.
A friend was admitted so I thought I'd stick around.
Everything OK?
Think so.
I hope so.
- Cup of tea?
- Green.
Thanks.
Thanks...
"Alright, alright!"
- Griffin...
"Oh, my God!"

"No I don't have time for that, just sit down."

Griff...

Sit down.
I need money.
"I got into some trouble with some guys tonight, and, uh, they say that if I don't pay them tonight, I..."

I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.
- No...
"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"
"Sandy, I'm scared, I am scared,"

"No, no, hey, your family right here."

You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument.
"Please, don't move your hand."
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory is a funny thing.
I am an expert and I do not know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were...

You need $4.70 more.

"You see, because last year when I came from Blitzen, Washington to Los Angeles, it cost $26.40."
"Now it doesn't seem fair to go from Los Angeles to Blitzen, Washington for $31.10, so I think something's wrong."

Doesn't have to go talk to Ms. Rinsky.
"Deal. ""Two trains are leaving the station at the same time..."""
Fine!
I'll go.
What was I worried about?
It had been months
Since I last saw ms.
Rinsky.
She might not even remember me.
Hi.
Ms. Rinsky.
Frankie Heck.
Brick's mom?
Ohh.
Not today.
She remembers me.
Would you like me to come back another time?
No.
Sit.
Talk.
Unburden yourself during my limited free time.
Okay.
"Well, see, Brick got a ""d"" on his math test."
"Sometimes kids get D's, but not your son."
"Oh, no."
He has to be perfect
"At every single thing he does, right, mommy?"
I...
"You know, ms."
"Rinsky, you're very funny."
Brick never mentioned how funny you are.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.

He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.

Senor.

"Eric, you've gotta get away from here."
"No, I won't leave you."
"You pitiful, insignificant fools!"
Look out!
Now I am the ruler ofall the ocean!

Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
So much for true love!
"She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?"
"Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty."

"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...

Why did you have to tell me?
"Left, right, face."

Your brother was a good man.
"Yes, he was."
She won't get out of the car.
Oh...
Hey.
"Welcome home, Maggie."
"You know, I think it'll make you feel better to be with everyone."

I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.
Dating?
"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?
Henning.
He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.
-Are You good?
"Yes, yes."
"And this is my son, Hogarth."
"Thank you, Annie."

And the other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
(CHUCKLING) A hundred-foot robot?
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.

"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"

I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.

What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.

I'm sorry.
What do you think?
"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"

"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"

"- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt."
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
"That's what I shoot, a.45-.60."
"Shoot what, Tom?"
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
"He's dead, too."
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
-Yes.
He tries to buy their freedom.

He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.

Okay.
"Um, it just means you get 10 percent off a pay-per-view movie."
Oh.
Could I trade that in for a free breakfast?
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
"So, what brings you to Denver?"
"Oh, I'm just, uh, passing through."

"I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh?"
I don't think so.
Dalton.
"Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic."
"Well, that's okay."
I guess we've both had a long day.

You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?

A woman.

You're the devil.
Whoa.

Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."

"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.

He's just on a call.
"So, the IRA agreed to an Offer and Compromise, on your tax case."
The IRA?
The... the IRS.
"You'll have to pay a penalty, we can deal with all the specifics later, but you have some un-cashed checks in your file."
You should take a look at those.
Thanks.
I'm not gay.
You asked whether I was gay?
Yes... two years ago.
I know.
I wanted to answer.
"I'm not gay, I'm flexible."
Okay.

"Hey, what ever happened with that guy?"
What guy?
The... the heart guy.
"The one you really liked, but he was married and his wife was your patient."
What was his name?
Noah.
"Yeah, Noah."
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....

"Yes, it's been a long time."
"Now, look, Buddy."
I don't need that.

"No, you're not."
So stop comparing yourself to him.
You have no reason to.
You have everything you everwanted.
You earned it.
I have never felt this way.
I would have never known if I hadn't met you.
I'm soaring!
You know you totally get me.
It's weird.
You are so my type.
Mysterious.
"Stylish, cool."
"A little crazy, but not bad."
This is the kind of boy I wanted.
But this...
"Actually before I met him, I didn't know what I wanted."
Now it doesn't listen to me.
It belongs to him.
Shiv.
Ya.
Sure?
About that Shiv?
Sure?
Sure.

And you put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave.
"I never pressed ""Start""."
What's going on?
I'm sleeping with her.
"Oh, Mark!"
Not again.

I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.

That's why I'm taking the point.
PETERSEN:
We're close to that rendezvous area.
KIRBY:

You wouldn't understand.
"Okay, then tell me, Mike."

You don't like baseball no more?
"Fine, I get that."
"What do you like, Michael?"
Football?
Basketball?
You like school?
"Oh, I love it."

Not in good voice?

Sing it gaily.

Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.

He was 18.

It was my fault.

What kind of troubles?
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money and, well, you know, kids, they can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?

They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.

"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"
We could play cards.
"But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you?"
You might read to me.
Yes.
Yes.
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.
"Come on, beautiful!"
Open up!
"Ursula, you're my dream girl."
I've been dreaming about you for months.
My name's not Ursula.
What is it?
Suzanne.
How old are you?
I don't know.
Have any kids?
Why not?
"Ursula, be mine!"
Only three bucks!
Damn bitch!
Always suspicious.
Always messing around.
I'm getting fed up.
Got any bright ideas?
I might if I had some bread.
Hold on.
Whas up?
An idea.
What?
Is staring you in the face.
Is still warm.
Don't start in again.
"Feels good, doesn't it?"
How's that for a smooth ride?
Hydraulic suspension.
"Come on, don't crap your pants."
Want some toilet paper?
Mr. Adda!
-Yeah?
I am not Adda!
I am Chaddha!
Oh Mr. Chaddha!
"-Yeah, go on!"
"Mr. Chaddha, your goods are ready."
-Yeah.
Goods!
What kind of goods?
Where do they come from?
Who are you guys?
I guess you havent recognized us!
"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!
I think you are forgetting.
I am forgetting!
"Yes, right!"
"So guys, do one thing!"
Just forget about it!
Forget?
"What are you saying, Mr. Adda?"
Mr. Chaddha!
"Mr. Chaddha, dont do this, otherwise we will be ruined!"
..
We might die also!
-Yeah!
What can I do if you are going to die?
"Its all right, if you cant do anything!"
We want to meet your boss!
-Yeah!
Then go to right and turn to left!
"Or are you gonna stand up, spit it out... and go spill theirs?"
- Akan!
- You fuck...
No!
Stop!
I am ordering you to stop!
Henry!
Stop!
Where is he?
No.
"Fuck you, motherfucker!"
Fuck you!
"How could you do this to me, Henry?"
How could you fucking do this?
Answer me!
Answer me!
Motherfucker!
"What happened, Henry?"
You were supposed to love me.
Henry!
Henry!
Listen to your heart!
"Hello, Henry."
"Well, if you're hearing this, there's one more thing I need you to do."
Hey?
You... little... pussy..
"Hello, Henry."
"You can't speak, but that's normal."
"No, that isn't normal, but only temporary, okay?"
Do you remember how you got here?
That's fine.
"NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE,"
STAY IN THE CAR UNTIL I SAY.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
WHERE'S YOUR SON?

Thanks.
I hope she floats.
"You want to get that stern line, please?"
- Afternoon.
- Hello.
Give me the bottle.
Let me rephrase that:
Give me the bottle now.
- You know this is a no-wake zone?
"- No, sir, I didn't."
- Drive a little slower next time.
- We have to give them a ticket.
"- No, we don't."
- They were speeding.
-Hazelden?
What's this?
-It came for you in the mail.
Recovery?
"You put me on mailing lists for junkies, now?"
Where do you get your balls?
-What are you doing?

A classy piece like this?
"Horse with the trees, wooden frame?"
"$25,000 to $30,000 at a minimum."
"I think it was Tony said he wanted it burnt,Paulie,specifically."
"-Put it in my car, I'll take it home."
-All right.
It'd be an honor to hang this picture in my house.
"Tony, can you come down here, please?"
What's the matter?
-What happened?
-Your nephew.
Christopher did this?
He hit you?
What for?
-What's the difference?
-He was high.
"Little prick, I'm going to wring his fucking neck."
Where is he?
He's been using drugs.
Heroin.
-Who's this?
"-You called me, maricon."
"-Where's Christopher, asshole?"
"I hardly think she'd have the nerve to appear, let alone testify."
Have you heard what happened?
I was there.
I saw it.
You...
You mean you saw the man?
Did I?
"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.
"You know, Nancy never had a chance."
"Well, that explains everything."
I'll let you see for yourself.

Help me with the trick.
"Oh, Wilbur, stop."
Help me with the trick!
I want to do it!
One trick.
Hold my hands and then...
All right.
Oh!
I landed right on my feet.
Very suave.
"And, uh, and a good trick."
"Oh, swords!"
You're going to become my puppet.
Puppet...?
You plan to brainwash me?
What's that!
You're responsible for this?

What are you talking about?
Go take a look!
You're not...!
Hurry!

Adios!
My name is Chidou;

"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, I got myself something there."
What?
A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- Stop it!
Ugh!
[glass shatters] [coughing] [panting]
"Oh, no."
Why did you make me do that?
I guess I'm on my own.
- Psst.
- There you are.
You're all right.
"- Yeah, you are too."
You're ready.
"- Yeah, I know."
That's what I was saying the whole time.
But it feels good to hear you say it.

Come on!
Get up there!
"Come on, gray boy!"
"Come on, Buck."
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
You look like shit.
But your boat looks great.
Yeah.
"I live on my boat, man."
Personal hygiene goes out the window.
A lot of time to work on the place.
BEN:
You should try working on a shower.
NEIL:
Yeah.
"Hey, what can I tell you?"
"Standing on principle, man."
It's all I got.
Cigarette?
"No, I'm good."
"That's right, you quit."
Good for you.
BEN:
So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
"Yeah, pretty much."
What are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
[LAUGHS]
Break.
Any word from Beth?
"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be..."
Sister's what?
Her wedding.
Her sister's wedding.
- Isn't that what I said?
- No.
"You said ""funeral."""
Rosalinda...
For your kindness and hard work over so many years...
The penthouse is yours.
Mommy!
Daddy just gave away our house!
"Oh, really?"
Did he?
Who'd he give it to?
Shalom.
"So, I got assigned Rautavaara's ""Piano Sonata No. 2""..."
"- You know, ""The Fire Sermon""?"
"- Yeah, it's wonderful."
Sounds like a piece of cake for you.
Are you kidding me?
- It's the hardest in the canon.
- We'll get together later.
Who's that?
That's Miles.
He's a junior.
"He studies guitar and composition, and he deejays in Chinatown on the weekends."
He's cute.
"Yeah, he's okay."
"Oh, my God."
He's looking over here.
What's wrong with him looking at you?
I don't want him to see me in this.
This outfit is stupid.
You'll freeze to death.
Here.
No.
Easy.
We'll swap.
So I will transfer you my energy.
I will transfer my karma.
Here is my karma on you.
Jason!
You have a great aura.
Yes.
Jason!
Encouragement!
Yes!
This is a great way to stretch.
Yep.
You see?
You could do this with your partner at home.
Sure.
Let's ride this energy out!
Keep your chin up.
Yep.
"Yes, this fire has just started."
And we will not put it out.
What is he doing?
I don't really know that pose.
"Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Please regard me.
I'm sorry?
"Please, allow me."
To do what?
Regard me.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
"You are doing fantastic, my dear."
Do you think I'm bad?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How can you be sure?
I know.
You're good.
"Well, since I'm good, can you get me a bowl to fetch milk?"
"When I go to the fields, I'll find one."
I want it now.
It will only take two minutes.
I'm late.
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.
Go on.
"Mim Hamideh, hello."
Do you have a milk bowl for the engineer?
"Yes, by the window."
All right.
She says to bring the bowl back.
I have to go.
Off you go.
May God give you pride.
May God give you good health.
May God give you a long life.
- Excuse me.
- Don't mention it.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
is Kakrahman's house here?
What do you want?
Milk?
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Aren't we going back?
"We still have some time, right?"
For what?
I want to be with you a bit longer.
When he comes...
He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.
"Ah, here."
They don't even have a front desk.
Isn't it the one outside?
Is it?
Let's try the second floor.
They're all empty.
No one's here.
This is crazy.
"- No, please don't."
- I think I'm going crazy.
Be patient.
Let's meet in Seoul.
He'll go nuts if he finds out.
But I want to have you.
So bad.
- Really?
"- Yes, really."
For real.
"Then, strip."
Everything?
"- Elizabeth, how are you doing?"
- Fine.
Good.
"Well, we'll catch up downstairs."
- I heard rumors.
"- All true, I'm afraid."
The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
"I'm so sorry, Robert."
"What, about my arm or about not being there?"
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope.
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
- Dr. Corday.
How was London?
- Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the ER.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
"Well, good luck."
"- Bite me, panty smellers!"
"- Ma'am, you need to calm down!"
Five years.
Ended a while ago.
No baggage.
"No baggage, love that."
"No baggage, no babies."
Likey. (LAUGHING)
This is fun.
I'm having a fun time in this place.
"And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?"
WAYNE:
Katy!
It's impolite to talk about your money.
He's no slouch.
Okay.
Touche.
"Well, I'm about to begin your story."
"Where maybe one is ""too hard."""
"Maybe one is, um..."
- But in the end...
"- Yeah, you lost him."
He seems...
He seems nice.
Do you live...
Do you live in here?
"So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne?"
Ready to fall in Goldi-love?
Or Goldi-lust?
You won't be Goldi-laughin' when I break your Goldi-legs.
Dim the Goldi-lights?
Nights of your Goldi-life?
Use your Goldi-language.
Make her Goldi-laugh.
"- Yes, that's it."
It says:
"""At the foot of the mountain."""
"Hello, why are you late?"
- Why are you late?
- You've been waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Who told you to wait?
My uncle.
"I see, your uncle is..."
Mr Hashemi Masti.
It's a long way to your village... lt's not far!
Not far?
What do you think of your village?
"I've lived here since I was born, I know it."
We're your guests then?
Yes.
Do I turn left here?
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.
Since two p.m.
I've been waiting since school finished for the day.
My uncle said:
"""My friends are coming."
"Bring them to the house."""
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.
But you mustn't tell anyone.
- All right.
- Good boy.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for lost treasure."
Good idea.
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.
- I love you.
"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.
-That's part of it.
"-Yeah, me too."
I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
When did this happen?
When you were with her.
Christ.
Why didn't you beep me?
"Hey, John, you were in Milwaukee."
"Look, I've got a patroleo with her."
Who?
Crowe?
"Aw, Jesus, Tommy."
I told him to call me... if anything happens...
anything at all.
Let me ask you something.
"You believe her, don't you?"
"Yeah, sure, I believe her."
"Tommy, could you take over for Crowe through tonight... just till I get my head fucking straight here?"
"Good morning, Miss Brody."
Where's John?
He's working.
You'll be safe with me.
"Well, can you tell me when he'll be available?"
No.
No message.
Miss Brody!
It's Detective Ridgely.
Is everything all right?
Did you get my messages?
I've been calling you... and calling you.
Are you OK?
Where's Ridgely?
Ridgely?
What are you...
Do you have a death wish or something?
"Yes, I am."
"Congratulations, Dick."
- [DoorOpens] - [Man] Mr. Ziegler.
"Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back."
- The hell with them.
"- I'll go back, Mr. President."
"No, uh, theywantyou, Mr. President."

What is the matter with you?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
"I'm awfully sorry I dropped my suitcase, and I hope I didn't hurt you, mister."
"I'll put all my things back in the suitcase, and I'll get out of your way."
What is this?
(EXCLAIMING)
"Look out, conductors!"
It's the little boy!

He can't have gone far.
I've got to find him.
CONDUCTOR 1:
You've got to find him?
We've got to find him.
Half-fare!
CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.
"What's the matter, son?"
You're trembling.
I have very loose bones.
Are you lost?
I'd rather have four honest words than 50 pages of bilge.
"- Now, you play Rose..."
"- No, I play Rose."
And I play Lily.

Uncle Frank.
Mr. Hilliard.

Unfortunate experience.

No.
"Oh, that?"
You go and save the best for last
Oh!
What's happening?
What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."
- I'm coming in!
"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.
- What are you doing?
He's my friend too.
We really grew on each other.
Thanks.
I am counting on you.

Fire!

Where is the fire?
"The warehouse with medicinal herbs from Ming, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
You must find his journal.
That's the only way to bring the baron down.
He won't store it in an obvious place.
He will keep it very close to him.
That idiot!

Excuse me.

Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?

Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.
No.
It's me... and the godfather of my son.
You're kidding.
"That's what Julia wants, too?"
Yeah.
What do you say?
Yeah!
You bet!
I know.
Put it under there.
What are you doing that for?
I'm just passing the time.

I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
"Oh, that's good."
You like that?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
Fantastically.
Fantastically.
Courageously.
Courageously.

You don't have to bubble-wrap everything.
It's not like you're moving to the north pole.
Oh.
That's not yours.

I didn't hear about anything...
Where was he going to go leaving me here?

We heard her confession.
"But if this is Judy, where is Sally?"
"Uh, beats me."

"Judy, stop that."
The least you can do is show them you're sorry.
"Thank you, Judy."
Now all you have to do is tell me where Sally is.

I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Renee!
Let me in.
Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
"What do you mean, ""no""?"
"Cliff, where is he?"
As...
"As soon as I heard the police coming in, I told him to get out."
I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.
- What are you on about?
- David's not like you.
He won't cope in prison.
Give him a chance to get away.
Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.
Grab your case.
Come on.
"I'm staying here, in case John comes back."
Father!
...
Mother!
You killed us all.
- And ... three!
- Higher!
- Hey
"- Higher, higher!"
- You wanna go higher.
Okay everyone back to classes now
I just wanted to do something different.
Yeah.
Well that's definitely different.
- You don't like it?
"- No, I like it, I like it a lot"
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"- What's going on, Tris?"
- Nothing.
I'm fine.
Just...
Still having nightmares?
No.
We're good.
You and me.
"I know nothing else is, but we are."
Time for chores.
How much longer do we have to stay here for?
Until we know it's safe to leave.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Son!
You can't ignore me forever.
Why don't you take it?
I don't know.
It was Bennet's.
- I'd feel weird.
- Carrie...
"It's not your fault, what happened to him."
It's Bennet's.
You did a good job.
You should own that.

I want to see what happens when he wakes Harper.
Up!
Up you lazy bastards
Up!
Come on!
"Blessings are guarding you, friend."
"Can't you see I'm an officer, you bloody bogtrotter?"
And I'm Napoleon Bonaparte.
Has anybody seen the new officer?
Major Dunnett told me to find him.
Name?
Rank?
Patrick Michael Harper.
"Chosen Man, sir."
You?
Chosen Man?
Show me.
What's this?
Liquor?
Liquor displeases the Lord.
"Give it here, Harper, so I can destroy it."
"Oh, blimey."
A bloody Methodist.
"That's best brandy, sir."
"Top of the morning, Harper."
who the blazes are you sir?
"Lieutenant Sharpe, sir."
These are my orders.
Sharpe.
Sharpe?
Are you the fellow
- that Wellesley raised from the ranks?
"All right, I want to conduct."
You can't conduct.
I want to conduct!
No!
Let Wilbur conduct.
MAN 1:
Let Wilbur conduct!
MAN 2:
"Go ahead, Wilbur!"
"Now by popular demand, we bring you the interstate choir conducted by Wilbur Hoolick!"
Good luck.
"Oh, don't go, Mr. Miles."
Help me out with this number.
What number is it?
I Like to Hike.
"So do I, but what's the song?"
"I Like to Hike is the name of the song, and do it with dignity."
Dignity!
"Oh, yeah."
I...
I'll be dignity.

I know.
"Look, Janki.."
Janki.

"..I come back, you dont even talk to me!"
"See, sister-in-Iaw!"
See.. see..
I have brought so many saris for you!
See!
"This pink one, this black one, this red one!"
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead."
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.
It fucking knows.
It knows.
- It knows!
- It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
- Now open the door.
"- Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.
Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay."
Fuck.
Okay.
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
We're going to have a baby.
"Which, frankly, scares the hell out of me."
It'll be great.
Yeah.
"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.
LUC:
I'm... (STAMMERlNG)
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be an aunt!

"Girls,"
I think you should come upstairs.
I'll be right here.
"You will, won't you?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
"That's very, very good."
Commander.
What is it?
A group of people escaped the blockade.
What?
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
Who's your favorite player?
"Who's your favorite player, Ben?"
"Hey, come on!"
Who's your favorite?
- Mark Grace.
- Mark Grace?
What?
Are you nuts?
Shawon Dunston's the man.
Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Next season I'll take you to Wrigley Field.
"Come on, stick with me!"
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field....
"Come on, damn it!"
We'll get a couple of dogs then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?
There you go.
"Hey, stay up!"
Stay awake!
Keep your head up.
Keep your head above water.
All right.
"All right, so you think that you know a lot about baseball, do you?"
Come on.
All right.
Ask me a question.
Come on.
Ask me a tough one.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...
"Henry, stop dicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
Chop Chop.
Shh.
"It's me, Jimmy."
Move.
"Oh, shit."
Those pigs are here again.
Psst!
Don't compromise my lab.
Let them leave.
There's some cyanosis in his fingers.
- Heart rate...
- 185.
I've gotta tube him.
Scope!
"- I'm here, what's up?"
- Sudden acute respiratory distress.
Looks like trauma to the neck.
Obstructed airway.
- Kid's circling the drain.
- I need the endoscope.
- What?
Why?
"- This temp airway the cops put in,"
I can't take it out.
I gotta intubate through it.
Damn it!
- What's yours for?
- I can't...
No landmarks.
- O2 sats down to 88.
"- Hurry, Jerry!"
- There's too much swelling!
- We don't have time.
"OK, hold on, I think I got it."
ET tube.
- OK great.
Let's get ready...
"- No, sorry."
It's totally closed.
- Heart rate up to 190.
- He needs an airway now.
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."
(moaning)
Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."
[Aunt] Xiao-Mei!
Yes?
[Aunt] The sheriff is leaving.
I'm coming.
You trust them more than me.
I trust you enough to be honest about this.
Look at this place.
"Locks, cameras everywhere."
You obviously think someone is watching you.
"But as soon as something bad happens, you point the finger at me?"
How do you know you haven't been hacked or broken into?
Have you even considered that?

Yep.

We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.

"Run, run, run!"

"I was, um, I was just..."
You were with someone in here.
"No, I wasn't."
Who was it?
Skip?
I said I was alone.
"Okay, okay, fine."
I just thought I heard a man's voice.
"Come on, the meeting's started."
Let's go.
"Hello, my name is Skip, and I'm an addict."
"Hi, Skip."
Uh...
I was in love... with a bottle.
"We slept together, we worked together, and... we got fired together, and, uh...if--if booze was..."

NARRATOR:
He was brought across in 1228.
Preyed on humans for their blood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that...?
Was that a conscious choice?
- I'm gonna dig into you.
- I think so.
- I think I remember being...
- I love Switzerland.
I think I remember saying it.
It's just...
"Like, yeah."
Well...
"Of course, those aren't gonna work."
And then Andy said a lot of funny stuff here.
He gave that guy a lot of funny names like Cheddar and...
What were the...?
The names were:
"Switzerland, Steinbrenner."
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
T-Bone.
"- T-Bone, yeah."
- Michael.
- And he said a lot of funny stuff.
- Your tighty whities are visible.
Yeah.
Kat made me have the most uncomfortable meeting with Andy Samberg.
- I didn't mean to.
I was so 7th grade and embarrassed.
I didn't mean to.
You were gonna meet him that night or you weren't.
"I was like, ""Oh, Andy's here?"
"Selena, I don't want to wait that long."
I want to marry you now and become a lawyer too.
"Honey, don't cry."
It's nothing to cry about.
"Please go, Ted."
Just go.
Okay.
I guess I picked the wrong time.
"I'll come back tomorrow, when you're feeling better."
"Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Why, Nellie you didn't have to come to work today."
Work keeps my mind off of things.
"Selena's all right now, isn't she?"
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.
"Everything is just trouble, Mrs. MacKenzie."
Just trouble.
"Nellie, don't do any work today."
Just sit around and relax.
"Happy Labor Day, Mother."
Something's wrong.
She's upset.
"Can't blame her, with Lucas gone and nobody knows where he is."
I've gotta run.
Bye.
"- Hi, Norman."

- How are you?
- Fine.
Come on.
"Hello, Mike."
Where'd you come from?
- Back there.

You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.

- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."

I went to the hospital to see Yoon Jae...
But he looked really busy.
What?
Yoon Jae's at the hospital right now?
Well...um...
I'll leave the dumplings with the front concierge desk.
So make sure to tell him...
To pick it up and eat it.
He totally dissed me.

-Assistant principle...

-What?

-It's nothing.
-Teacher Gil Da Ran!

I was looking at them.
Put them down right now.
Those files...
"You were looking at them, Teacher Na?"
"Yes, Assistant Principal."
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.

"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
I don't know.
I just thought.
"Well, you didn't think so good."
How do you know?
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Ok?
Really.
Ok.
You ready for sleep?
Good night.
"Good night, honey."

"it's my mother, tom."
She's alone.
I never should have left her.
"At least in New York, I'd be near."
I'd be close to her.
"I could see about a transfer, Damien."
"I need reassignment, tom."
I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"I think I've lost my faith, tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
Stop!
Stop Mister!
Stop your r!
Hey!
Stop it Mister!
- Are you a part of these items?
- I am extra load!
I was extra load but now I am notll got rid of it!
"Let it be here, I will come back soon!"
- What are your burdens?
"- Those are my burden, can't you see them?"
The burden of misery and adversity!
The burden of cowardice!
What's your relationship with her'?
She is my sister!
- Your sister?
- Yes.
- Your sister?
- Yes.
Hey!
Mister!
Mister!
Officer!
My carfs wheel is there.
It's forbidden.
That's my wheel fell down there.
Go!
Go!
"No entrance, it's forbidden."
Ok!
But it has gone there itself!
"Go, go."
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."
- What?
- The racket and the whole 5000 votes.
- After you nearly killing the guy?
- Go on.
Beat it.
- Are you staying here?
- Yep.
- So am I.
Molly!
She crashed in CT.
Pressure dropped.
Now she's unconscious.
- Said her stomach hurt.
- Could've blown a mesenteric clot.
"Harper, get four units O-neg."
"Stay with us, Ben."
Paddles.
Paddles!
Charging 200.
Clear.
Charging 300.
Clear.
- I got a faint pulse.
- Pulse ox is 80.
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
It wasn't my call.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
[Yelling]
"Come on, Kamen!"
I'm sorry.
"No, Kaman!"
Please don't!
"Oh, God!"
[Screaming]
[Screaming continues]
[Tires screeching]
[Car horn blaring]
[Siren blares]
[Hotch] Yeah.
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
- He was fired seven months ago.
- [Garner] Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.
[Siren wailing]
[Train whistle blaring]
Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
"- All right, you fellas."
It looks like you're in need of some assistance.
- Get back!
- Huh?
- Back off!
- Huh?
"I said back off, motherfucker!"
Hey.
Hey!
Ho!
"Oh, man!"
Give me the case.
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Whoa!
Hail Yamaha.
"Ah, Jesus Christ!"
This night never ends.

- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.
Bring a yoghurt!
Sorry!
Pauline!
He's lovely...!
"Straight to the top of the stairs and quietly, please!"
Quiet.
Quiet!
"I shall be checking hands, faces, boots, and hair ribbons."
"The Halle Orchestra looks smart, so must we."
"Baker, come here."
You... are a chump.
What are you?
"I'm a chump, sir."
If Miss Riall had seen you in that state that would have been it.
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
"Okay, come on, come on."

This way!
"Hey... hustle, hustle!"
Let's go...

Come on!
Take 'em up...
Let's get out of here.
Song:
I have been a witness to the spilling of the blood seen a lifeless body lying in the mud
I walked away alive with a wounded heart but I had to heal it
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
Has there been any change?
No.
They believe that she might remain in this condition for some time.
We will wait as long as it takes.
We are used to waiting.
"I bet that she will be surprised, waking up to find that everything has changed."
Will I...
Will I seem different to her as well?
"She will think that you have grown into a fine man, I'm sure of it."
I shall return.
Milord Slaine!
Rittuo...
Eddelrittuo...
Milady...

She is awake...
Your Highness!
It is me!
It is Slaine!
Do you recognize me?
"It's Slaine, Slaine Troyard!"
I am Slaine Troyard...
Your Highness...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Your Highness!
I've been waiting so long to hear you say my name once again!
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!
#... around me
"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?
- There was an accident.
What did he do to her?

[boy #1] more goons!
[boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
[older boy #1] hey!
"[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.

[laughing]
That was an ambush!
[older boy #2] stop banging into me.
[older boy #1] I can't see.
[older boy #3] I can't get out.
[older boy #4] get me out.
Get it off me.
[boys] yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"Oh, you think you're pretty good, do you?"
I am deadly accurate in everything I do.
Old Mr. Chads here.
The meanest teacher I ever had.
"- Oh, he was harmless."
- Mm-mm.
"Easy for you to say, he liked you."
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
That's because he never knew
I was the one putting' gum on his seat.
"Oh, that was you?"
"He'd jump up all wiggly and squirmy, grabbing' at his backside, th... that squeaky little voice of his cooing like a pigeon."
"Ooh, ooh."
[laughing]
- [cork popping]
- Ooh!
[laughing]

"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
I'll beat you up!
Watch the teapot!
I don't need your advice!
I'm telling you
You...
"Get off, right?"
"Okay, I'll take your word"
Why are you pulling my clothes?
"Gao, are you really leaving?"
Y es!
But bear this in mind
"It's me who fired you, not vice versa!"
"Oh, you asshole!"
"Hi, is there some gold here on the road?"
It's you again!
Stay calm!
I just want to ask you something
Mind your head!
"Oh, you two are killing each other?"
Who exactly is your Brother Y an?
Y an Qingwang!
How come he stayed with Thunderstorm?
Say!
"Y es, yes!"
I'll tell you!
Brother Jin is killed!
"Y es, after Y an Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun"
He stayed at Thunderstorm's house

"THAT NICE LITTLE SECRETARY OF YOURS, DARLING."
HMM.
I WONDER WHAT SHE'S GOT.
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.

"So, Emma, what kind of music do they play?"
It's like an '80s pop vibe mixed with a little Black Keys.
Cool.
This is gonna be painful.
Be nice.
"So, Emma, how do you know Mat?"
"I think what she's trying to ask is, does he have a girlfriend?"
That's definitely what she's trying to ask.
That's not what I was trying to ask.
Do you guys want me to ask?
"Hey, Mat!"
No!
That is not what I was asking.
He's single.
- Lou?
- Yeah.

You're not our mom.
To your room!

I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!

Gone.
It wasn't a complete loss though.
Kuauo got it out.
We got it out.
"Wow, this is great."
"This is your new place, huh?"
"No, yours."
Mine?
Mine?
You don't like it?
"No, no."
I mean yeah!
It's just that it's so big.
"You know, for one person."
Perhaps that will change.
What kind of bullshit is that?
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.

Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
And is this a dessert or a side?
- It's a warm banana.
"- Oh, okay."
Halved... microwaved for two minutes.
- Hmm.
- Give that a shot.
"- Oh, 'cause it's..."
"- Oh, God, the middle is hot!"
- Take some water!
- [coughing]
- Mm.
- This is not a good meal.
"No, no, no, no, I'll just munch on this dry pasta."
"- No, no, it's okay."
- Babe...
You know what?
I have a better idea.
- What?
- I'm gonna go over there

- Okay.
"[""Between the Sheets"" by The Isley Brothers plays]"
"Oh, what?"

"Oh, you slid into it."
"Ooh, you miss these old moves?"
"- Oh, yes."
"- Come here, girl."
"Come on, yeah."
What's happening here?
What are you talking about?

"Where are we going, sir?"
Do you know the way to Makati?
I'm lost.
I don't know...
I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.
REED:
All right.
You're with me.
CREWMAN:
"Yes, sir."

"Captain, it's Trip!"
ARCHER:
You shouldn't have weapons in here.
HAYES:

MACO:
"Not here, sir."
Hayes to the Armoury.
"Armoury, respond."
Stand down!
[Tense instrumental music]
"-You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?"
-Tell them to stand down.
The Captain relieved you of duty.
When did I?
!
You gave it to Jai.
And Jai...
I get it.
It's between us.
Why drag Jaiprakash into this?
"All right, Hari..."
what's wrong?
Your touch has awoken the music in me!
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?
I've got to give you some news.
"Your husband is dead, isn't he?"
But don't worry...
"I'm willing to marry a ""window""!"
Window?
Aren't you a window now?
!
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!
But we will still meet!
No.
We will not.
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?
!
Don't look back.
But that man there...
The chap with the blue shorts?
- You know there is no such person.
- There is.
His name begins with F.
F?
A promising letter.
Foster?
Forrest?
Fotheringay?
Featherty?
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?
Might I play your pianoforte?
Yes.
Of course.
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive...
I cannot remember when we last had a song in the house.
Brandon!
Come and meet our beautiful new neighbours.
What a pity you're late.
You have not heard our songbird.
A great pity.
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?
- What's it like?
- Hot.
The air is full of spices.
Now.
Miss Dashwood.
it's your turn to entertain us.
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
What is it?
You won't tell me.
I'm hungry.
We can go to my place.
- Who did you inherit it from?
- My great-aunt.
She was great.
She loved collecting things.
She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled.
This was her depot.
- Her depot?
- So to speak.
You'll see.
"The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed."
Almost everybody.
Yeah.
She saved my life.
Just because you went shopping once!
"OK, OK."
Forget it.
- Lf I'd only known before.
- What?
That you're such a great roommate.
Where are you going?
What?
"I have to pee, you dumb cow!"
Or maybe not.
Hello.
Good-bye!
Shit!
Just a minute.
Great.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!
(sighs)
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
(sighs)
(SCOFFS)
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
(sighs) I gotta do this.
I gotta do this.
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.
Just a tad.
He won't even know I was here.

You just scared the hell out of me.
"Sorry, I..."
"I was just, I was..."

Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!

Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
Any other little tidbits of information
You'd like to share with us?
No.
"No, at least I don't think so."
[cell phone ringing]
Hello.
Guess where I am?
"You know,"
"This really isn't a great time,"
Lemme call you back.
"Sydney, I'm at a book signing."
And the guest of honour is
"Your druid expert, gareth watson."
Describe him to me.

Then who...?

Da veiga?
His son.
Da veiga doesn't have a son.

"I don't know, Ray."
"I said, where does he live?"
I don't know.
RAY:
"Where does he live, goddamn it?"
JACKIE:
I don't know.
RAY:
How do you get your shit?
"I said, where does he live, bitch?"
If we told anybody where Marco lives he'd kill us.
"Well, what the fuck do you think we're going to do, huh?"
Leave us the hell alone!
Don't hit her like that.
Please tell him and everything will be okay.
Jackie don't know.
I deal with Marco.
She don't.
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.
MARCO:
My God!

"Yawning like a princess, eh?"
Aren't you ashamed?
What is this?
A finger.
What else?
Acting smart!

How many are these?

And how many are these?
Your finger is swollen!

That explains it!
No!
Call the police!
You're an ill-mannered man!
No!
What are you up to?

The poor man will die!
He teases women in our area!
What nonsense?

I'm glad you've come!
Save me from this bear!
Look at my face!

"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
I used to cry for you!
And I used to engross in yourthoughts!

You're saying all of them sacrificed themselves?
Right.
"The documents that are related to the raid, they've all been destroyed."
The North Koreans sent a team.
All the press people are missing.
Their identity cards have been erased.
"For now, we are the only five people who know about this."
"- Yeah, so did I."
- So did I.
[PHONES BEEPING]
GOSSIP GIRL:
You wanted to meet Gossip Girl?
"Well, look around."
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high-school friendships fade it's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
"Now that all my secrets are out, you have a clean slate until college."
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you.
GIRL:
"Oh, my God."
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Wonderful.
NATE:
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about what I said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's Chuck?
It's over.
Once and for all.
But I'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
"You know, everyone's here."
Yeah.
Everyone's here.
"- Oh, it's beautiful."
"- By the way, what's your name?"
Sheena
Here I am.
Shall we...?
- Take it easy
Pump it up
- It's pumped.
Look
It's nothing.
"- Raj, where have you been?"
As usual.
Caught up with a girl
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train
And she falls for me.
- What...?
He bored me.
"He had me all alone, and he began flirting"
Same old hat... haven't I seen you before?
She sidled up to me.
- What?
I was scared!
"Only so much space, and there she was with me"
Then?
- Then what?
She was lost in my eyes
He was after my eyes.
Wouldn't shut up.
Boys these days...
These girls!
I just managed to come out unscathed
What's that?
Red Cross!
- Hello?
- Hey!
Hello.
Is your mom home?
"No, she's not home."
She's not upstairs?
We heard something.
"No, that was our dog."
- She's not home?
- No.
It's our dog.
When does she get back?
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where can we wait?
Let's see how much we raised.
- The money also?
- I can count everything.
- What a bad handwriting.
- Yes.
Like a doctor's prescription.
Barely legible.
You want to go to school again?
- Well ...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school?
- In Vienna.
"It's a lot busier there, huh?"
We have already picked up a nice sum.
"If everyone continues to give as much, we did well."
We'll see how much more we get.
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
"Addons Yes I see, Gwen, but do not worry."
Addons you will receive another assignment.
Addons you have to seduce Max.
You should store it somewhere.
We can not go from here ...
I can not see it.
You have seen.
"You must be clean, Max."
Asshole.
I killed him anyway.
Release.
Be careful.
Sitting quietly.
Lord!
Damn.
That's all right.
Do you think this plane was going to die?
I do not know.
Maybe.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Please help me.
"If not, my brother would die."
I can not afford it.
- What do you do now?
What?
- Luggage can be accessed here.
- Please.
- That's what I thought.
- Wait.
"- In my bag, I have a laptop."
With him we have access to the Internet.
Everyone okay?
SAM:
Dirk.
[GUN CLICKS]
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
Everybody stay where you are.
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
I'm like 21 Jump Street.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
-Where is it?
-No way you'll ever find it.
SAM:
Where is it?
"Sam Winchester, still a bully."
"You, you jocks."
"You popular kids, you always thought you were better than everybody else."
"And to you, I was just Dirk the Jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
[ Laughs ]
We're gonna take this puppy out on the road now!
"Wow. [ Laughs ] Um, thanks, mom."
I am just so psyched for this.
Andy:
I am so psyched for this!
What are you working on?
Taking an untapped market by storm.
And you?
Raining savage fires of revenge on Andy's mortal enemy.
Cool.
Have fun.
"Street kids, you know what I'm saying?"
"So they put it together to become Ronnie, Bobby..."
[ Imitating Sprinkler ] Yeah.
[ Off-key recorders playing ]
"No, no, no, no!"
You got to play with your heart.
You got to feel it.
And why wear them backwards?
"Yes, because inside-out is wiggity, wiggity wack."
We are so fly!

"- Night, Buckley."
"- Night, Mrs. Cole."
- Pretty copper kettle.
- Such an age since...
- Bright copper kettle.
- Been such an age since...
"Pretty copper kettle, bright copper kettle."
There it is.
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never...
Mrs. Cole?
They'll never get us all out.
"Uh, where..."
Where is she?
- Thank you.
- Cut!
Could someone please get Mr. Hilliard out of Dunkirk?
- Find Mrs. Cole!
- Train ticket.
Ration card.
Authorization to travel.
"Oh, don't be nervous."
Mr. Hilliard won't notice you're gone--
It's not Hilliard.
It's Ellis.
"He's gonna be so disappointed in me for missing the opening, for not turning up till the last minute."
Nonsense.
"Your husband is a lucky man, Mrs. Cole."
I'm sure he knows it.
He's not my husband.
Let's get you into makeup.
Hm...
You do look handsome in your sowester.
Mr.Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
I'll blame War Transport.
He'll have to make a deal with me.
So?
Fishes!
Fishes every....
Don't...stand under any thousand pounders.
Uh.
The Director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
He didn't say what it's 'bout.
"Tell him, ""he can find me""."
But...
I have found you.
No you haven't.
You are a masseuse.
Leaning the way of the ship.
"With Johnnie cradled, cradled in your arms."
Cradle.
Oh!
No...no thank you.
You look up.
And you see coming towards you...across the deck.
A vision of loveliness.
And you say.
Get up!
"""Kid's pretty messed up."""
"Girl, kid's pretty messed up."
"How are you, Dud?"
Pleasure.
This is Dan Mackintosh.
"Hi, Dan."
John McFeely.
"Oh, yeah, McFeely."
"All them ""Mac"" names sound alike to me."
"Had breakfast, Charlie?"
Yeah.
Charlie's a goddamn Yankee from Detroit.
"Listen, Dale, if we talk to this guy and he's involved in this shit..."
I told you he don't know nothing...
Hurricane.
"Dale, these are dangerous people we're dealing with."
"Well, I understand that."
"Well, you boys about ready?"
Just a second.
DALE:
"Here you go, Fern."
Keep the change.
"There ain't no change here, Hurricane."
It's a $12 check.
You give me a ten.
I'll catch you later.
Is he gone?
I haven't had a full meal since I met the son of a bitch.
"2-10, go ahead, Jimmy."
Go over to Harlan Childress'.
Lureen said he's raising hell.
I'm on a case.
Unless he's trying to kill her I don't have time.
She said he is.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
You want to tell me what's going on?
"It must have been something I ate, I..."
Something you ate.
And now I...
I feel better.
- I think.
- What'd you eat?
- What's gotten into you?
"- I know you, Marie."
And I know when something's up.
And you know I'm gonna dig it out of you sooner or later.
Lamb.
I ate lamb.

"Young like, maybe in the 20s."
Long brown hair.
I promise you.
Pinkie swear.
Okay.
Enough.
Shit!
"Fun, huh?"
What's the worst that could happen?
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.
It's harder when you don't know what you are.
My love carries a death sentence.

I will live the life I choose.
"This is not the day to piss me off, kid."
"I told you, man."
I wasn't even there.
Because I was banging your old lady.
"- Yo, Dy."
Dyson.
- He broke my arm.
- Just breathe.
-It's not broken.
"- Breathe, breathe, breathe."
-It's just dislocated.

Bust it!
She still is.

Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
Break it down!
This is a waste of time.
We don't need him anyway.
I need him.
"If he's a member of the resistance, he may be able to help me contact my ship."

He's the one.
He took your mother.
We have to...

Don't give them one.
What?
I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.
Please!
Please...
You look like a helpful citizen.
"So, tell me."
You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today.
"No, sir."
"No, I've seen no one."
Please.
You!
"I'm looking for someone, a woman."
I haven't seen any woman.
There are two right over here.
"You see them, don't you?"
Yes.
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
Caylem...
Should I call the boss for you?
"Don't piss me off, I've a gun."

You're officially under arrest.
"I'm Inspector Mak Ho-Man, Michael Mak."

Where should we celebrate?
I've reserved a table at a good toro Japanese restaurant.
Expensive but I know you won't mind.
I'm not going.
You guys go ahead.
Why?
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
Miss...
- Doctor!
- Mr. Santarelli...
- What happened?
- Something... something terrible!
Three men kidnapped me.
"- Oh, God..."
- Three men?
- Yes...
No!

"No, it's not possible."
It's impossible!
What?
The three men...
were you and your friends!
Me?
I can't forgive your prank this time!
"It wasn't funny, you understand?"
- I'll have you thrown in jail.
- It wasn't us!
Twenty years in prison!
People don't do this for a joke!
You're thugs!

"No, you mustn't call."
What are you doing?
Of course I'm calling.
"Okay, I confess, I was with my friends."
"Ah, he confesses at last."
Of course.
I can't bear to see you with Dr. Cicchirini...
I'll start getting bigger in a few weeks.
You can hang around with someone else then.
No fellas'll come near us if one of us is pregnant.
"So, Sharon, who you havin' it for?"
I can't tell.
Sorry.
Sharon.
Give us a hint.
- No.
- Just a little one.
Do we know him?
You're scarlet.
We must know him.
Is he married?
- Jesus!
"- No, he's not."
I'll bet you he is.
- Is he in here?
"- Jesus, Yvonne!"
Would you do it with anyone here?
I was only asking!
"You're right, though."
"Sorry for insulting you, Sharon."
"Seriously, though, Sharon."
Do we really not know him?
No.
Swear to God.
Where did yous...
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, all right?"
"Let's get pissed, will we?"
"Oh, yeah."
Young Sharon's after getting herself up the pole.
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."

Come.

Go.

"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
"Hairy is the word that's just, I just picture his forearms, and being like, where are you?"

Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.

"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"

But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.

Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."

"833 01:08:34,200 --&amp;gt; 01:08:38,600 Okey."
It's better.
"834 01:08:38,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:43,200 Everything is okey..."
And that guy is back to his place where he belongs.
"835 01:08:48,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:50,900 Yaman is free."
"836 01:08:54,300 --&amp;gt; 01:08:56,600 He is by the Serez's."
"837 01:09:03,800 --&amp;gt; 01:09:07,900 It's obvious you become a mother very young, the same as me."
Type in a new card for Elizabeth.
"You got it. *the superintendent of schools,*"
*this money* *will now be redirected*
*to Sweet Valley High* *Activities Committee...*
Great.
"You're up next, Bruce."
(mutters) Bruce.
And that's all the news you need to know.
"Till next time, Sweet Valley."
"And now, with his... unique take on Sweet Valley,"
Bruce Patman.
"Thank you, Jess..."
"*I mean, Elizabeth.*"
Where's his card?
It's coming right up.
"*Hello, fellow Gladiators.*"
"*And as if you didn't know,* *I'm Bruce Patman,*"
*and this is* *the Patman perspective...*
(giggling)
I'm really sorry.
This has to be done.
What did Collins say?
I have to talk to the principal.
Can't say you don't deserve it.
"Hey, nice move back there."
You really got me.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?"
I'm impressed.
You're a nightmare.
*But I say there's nothing wrong* *with having money.* (Patty) Winston!
*I love the way money feels.* *I love the way money smells.*
I love what money does for me.
"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!
[groans]
Ow!
"All right, Old Man Blumpkin's house."
"-Yeah, but be easy on the old guy, okay?"
You know he's got that heart condition.
[gun cocks]
-What are you two turds doing in my house?
-Old Man Blumpkin?
-How can you see us?
Only ghosts can see other ghosts.
"-Duh, a--hole."
I just died.
-Ohh.
"-Wait, what did you just say?"
-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."
-Only ghosts can see other ghosts?
-But then... that means...
-You don't remember... do you?
"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
"-(dispatcher) Uh, please say again."
-I said we have an orange with the hiccups.
-(dispatcher) Oh no!
You're screwed!
"[screams, dial tone]"
-Ugh.
"All right, I'm out of ideas."
-[whimpers]
"-Look, everybody."
The important thing right now is to just remain calm.
-[hiccup]
[all screaming]
"-No, no, no!"
Everybody just shut up!
We're not going to freak out.
-That's easy for [hiccup] you to say.
You don't have an exploding [hiccup] hippo in your tummy.
"-Dude, it's not a hippo."
-It's an exploding hippo.
"-Listen to me, Orange."
Do you want to get rid of your hiccups?
-Duh.
"-Then you have to do exactly what I tell you, okay?"
-Okay.
"-Okay, it's really simple."
All you have to do is take a deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds.
-Okay.
[inhales] -(Pear) What?
"No, that never works."
-[groans]
-I always heard you have to stand on your head and cross your eyes.
-Mmm!
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
"- Okay, come."
Are you blind since childhood?
- Yes.
"Me too. . . . it's okay, don't worry."
It's okay. . .say hello to aunty.
Come.
What is your name?
- Babu.
"Babu, are you Hindu or Muslim?"
Where did he go?
Strange!
I asked him his religion and he disappeared?
It's time for my bus to come.
Who throws such things on the street like that?
Hey guy! . . . idiot!
Why are you. . . .
What are you doing in the middle of the street?
Damn !
What are you doing?
Move!
Move!
Can't you hear?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Mangoes?
You sell mangoes?
I don't eat mangoes.
I don't sell mangoes.
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
"If you have finished work, go home."
Why tell me?
I am stuck here.
Why are you troubling me?
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
Fuck Prince.
"Because it would have like, doves and sheer scarves."
TED LEO:
"I think it would anti-climactic, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Well, no-one's going to climax."
I feel like there would be a lot of whispering.
TED LEO:
"I feel like there would be all this lead up to it, and then you'd actually get down to it--"
BETH HOYT:
"And he'd just be like, missionary, and it would be over?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, right?"
TED LEO:
Yeah.
"And he's really little, you know."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He is really little.
BETH HOYT:
Cee-Lo might be the one to have sex with.
TED LEO:
That's what I'm saying.
BETH HOYT:
Because he's a giver.
"Do you watch ""The Voice?"" He really, like, is into, I think he might give just the right amount."
"Like, not Sting give, but--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I would do what I had to do to meet that cat.
That white cat he holds on that show.
BETH HOYT:
That's what he's saying.
What?
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.
[ Finch ]
She reads the articles.
[ Boys Moaning ]
Is she ?
She's goin' downstairs.
[ Moaning ]
"- Oh, my God !"
"- Jackpot, baby !"
- Can you believe this ?
"- Nadia, I would have never known."
I have an announcement that I would like to make.
There is a gorgeous woman... masturbating on my bed !
- [ Finch ]
"Thank you, Nadia !"
"- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it."
- [ Scoffs ]
"What am I supposed to do, Kev ?"
- Seduce her.
Wha-- What the hell would I say ?
Go over there and ask her if she needs an extra hand.
"- That's stupid, Kev."
I can't-- - That's not stupid !
You're stupid if you don't go !
Come on !
Get over there !
"- Get goin', man."
She's prime.
- Get out of here !
- She's waitin' for you.
"- Okay, all right."
It was a wonderful experiment until we burned the church down.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Fair enough.
OK.
Let's talk about collaboration.
"If you could work with anyone in the biz, who would it be?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I would love to work with Tina Fey.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Really?
Wow.
"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.
My goal is to fall unconscious six times and be a Robocop!
Ouch!
That really hurts!
A Robocop!
You're Robocop!
"Dad, Dal-rae's killing your son!"
Dal-rae?
"He deserved it, right?"
Of course.
Take her away Young-hoon!
Don't come back here again!
How can he be so filthy!
Audience:
Yes.
AB:
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
The money has been paid
When did I say that?
Go now I won't fight， I didn't say I would
She's really got the nerve.
She's special
She'll crush you to death!
Miss， I give up.
I give up
I give up
Beat her
Don't!
Open up
Help， help!
I hate being hit on the chest， you bitch!
Landal， what are you doing inside?
Why so noisy?
Nothing.
I'm composing
Does it sound pleasant?
So-so
What happened?
My brother's still not back.
What about your sister?
Mimi hasn't returned either
You alone?
And me.
What do you want?
I feel a bit lonely
Shall I keep you company?
No.
Good night
Good night
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
How... you know this better.
At present he's celebrating festival at Khandala...
"Your father, Pasha."
Santo!
Raghu!
Kali!
Badal!
God!
Who are you trying to threaten by firing in the air?
Those days of threatening and firing have gone.
Now I'm only a retired IG.
- Uncle!
- Yes.
Uma sent this photo for you.
Wow!
Dear father!
Your darling daughter Radha!
Did you see?
This time my daughter left me... ...for her college youth festival.
"Thank God, your darling sister is here."
"Sandhya, it's right that Jamna is my sister."
But reason her widows are not supposed to have long tongue.
Even I don't like it.
But she's a widow.
"So, I can't even say anything to her."
"Shanti, where's Jamna?"
Sitting in the backyard.
Reading a holy book.
Mother!
Aunt is calling you.
"You go, my son."
I'm coming.
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.

SPEAKER 18:
"Dude, we do lock our doors."
"Our house has been broken into a couple times by some people, mainly dudes."
SPEAKER 19:
I've taken self-defense classes.

"No, I haven't."
No.
SPEAKER 26:
"I mean, I've never really felt at risk."
SPEAKER 27:
Sexual violence?
"Well, I don't know."
It's not really something that I think about a whole lot.
SPEAKER 25:
It's not really something I think about that much.
SPEAKER 21:
"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it.
"Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:"
"Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:"
"Good, now put the incense out."

Sasha:
"Oh, boy. man:"
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha:
Uh...15. man:
All right.
Sasha:
15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:
Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.
"Whatever you say there, dude."

"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!
"- Really, sir?"
Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.
"- I'm coming, abla."
There's a lot of ironing to do as well.
"We'll get all done, abla."
Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.
- Who?
"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""
"""... beloved father of Arda and Tuba..."""
"""... husband of Sevgi Gencerel."""
His funeral will be on this afternoon.
A relative?
"Abla, are you okay?"
To the funeral?
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."

Whoo!
Teenager #16:

There we go.

Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
But I never had the proof.
"What are you talking about, Marla?"
"Your husband, Barry.... my ex-husband, Barry..."
"Denise, Barry's a selfish bastard."
What?
No!
"No, he's not."
No.
Look.
-Oh my god.
-Mm-hm
This is not happening.
He fooled me too.
There were always signs.
What signs?
Think about it!
Haven't you ever been stuck out in the cold with him?
"I got pneumonia once, but..."
You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.
Think about your last birthday.
Happy Birthday to you!
Mmm!
It's spongy.
Selfish bastards can't participate in the celebration of others.
It's been documented.
No!
It's not true!
He loves people.
He was so close to his brother and sister.
Selfish bastards recreate the past for personal gain.

This separation has tormented me a lot.

"I don""t know for which sin I am paying the price."
"For God""s sake leave!"
"Don""t force me to get you arrested."
"Don""t give people the chance to say.. ..that for 50,000 rupees a wife got her husband arrested."
"Leave! - seema, give me my child!"
Leave him!
"Don""t remind me that I am the mother of a smuggler""s son!"
"Mother, is he my daddy?"
Your daddy is dead!
He has ruined our happiness and peace!
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so lonely?
"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.

"Did you go to college, too?"
Why?
Anything say that I can't?
"No, of course not."

Bobby:
Dad's fault.
Cathy:

Sometimes... [speaking indistinctly]
And stop videotaping!
Cathy:

JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...

You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.

Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...

And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.

"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"

Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?

She was shocked.

Ah.
Sorry. woman:
Okay. man:
It's 24 July.
[laughs]
woman:
And what a day it is. man:
It's the best day ever.
woman:
You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.

woman:
Good morning.

Deceiving is your old habit!

"Many years ago you had killed.. ..the entire family of Goga lighthouse""s in-charge!"
"What's this, dad?"
What's wrong dad?!
What's this letter?
This is an expulsion letter from school
You skip classes?
"Dad, that was when I was in 7th grade"
Oh
And that was a while ago?
You ditched school?
You failure!
Dad it was a very long time ago
No more allowance! and no more Belila (Egyptian food)
I don't like it
Help me Sameh
I'll go get something from the car
Why don't you be more like Sameh?
Smart and clever and always studying really hard
Thanks dad
"You smoke behind my back, you scum?"
What?
You think I don't know?
I know everything!
Go upstairs so I can shower you

I'll shower you then I'll help you study

Let's go!
Go where?
He said he's gonna shower us
GO
COME ON KARlM
COME ON
I'm drowning
Go now.
It'd be bad if they returned
Please
I'll cope with you some other day
I don't know what you're up to.
Anyway， you must pay
How much? $200，000?
No， make it $20，000
Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?
She's coming up
Miss， it's late.
Come some other day
You've put on my underpants
You must be crazy
Now I've got the proof
Take them off now
Okay
These are yours.
Take them back
ln fact， it was my fault
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Now we're literally playing with power.
"Come on, jump."
Jump!
"Come on, Mario, jump!"
"God, how do I jump?"
"Come on, jump!"
Ass!
"Oh, jump is over here."
"Alright, here we go."
"Get the mushroom, oh-"
"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
- I did everything for you!
"I did everything, what else do you want me to do?"
"For God's sake, Basha."
Is your heart that cold?
"I beg you, answer me!"
What?
Answer me!
Popoy stop it!
Basha...
I love you.
And it hurts.
Take me!
Right now!
Take me right now!
Hello?
Where are you?
Huh?
Where?
"I've been going around here over and over, where are you?"
I'm coming.
You keep saying you're coming but I still can't find you!

"What are you saying , man?- Don't use every opportunity, to come close to Mira."
I don't want to see you next to her again.

Kill him
Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
"And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs, you get to the next step, which is customer validation."
An Advaita Song
Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.

Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.

"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."

I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.

"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.

"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!

TED LEO:
Ryan Gosling and James Franco.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, I'm done with Ryan Gosling."
"I'm done with like, girls being like, isn't it interesting that I have a crush on Ryan Gosling?"
Because I'd kill him just to get those girls to shut up.
"And then James Franco, why not?"
It would be a project.
It would be an art project.
BETH HOYT:
Absolutely.
"That's the way he would see it, too."
"Not that [INAUDlBLE] it's just, you know, his view on everything, right?"
It's all art.

You don't get him?
TED LEO:
"No, I just don't know, I don't know, I don't think I've seen anything he's been in."
You know what I mean?
"Like, it's that kind of, I feel like it's, I'm on some other side of some line."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Ryan Gosling, or James Franco?"
TED LEO:
James Franco.
BETH HOYT:
You will.
"He's like all the little, a bunch of things."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He'll show up at your house one day.
What's that for?
It's my granddad's cross.
It'll keep trouble away.
I'm off.
Go ahead.
You abandoned her!
You hear?
You got cold feet.
Say something!
Tell him he's a coward!
Shut up.
"You mean, everyone run for your life?"
- Yashka couldn't have helped.
- You would've abandoned her too?
What's the use?
He'd have got caught himself and not saved Ksanka.
For shame...
Wait for me here.
"If I'm not back by evening, you come..."
Valerka.
Who's there?
"It's me, Father Mokei."
Danka?
Thank God...
I thought you'd followed your father.
I'm still alive.

"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."

It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
Yes

It's scary.
I think it's scary.

"Malena, listen."

Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?

This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."

Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.

We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
I have.
Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...
It is make-believe?
"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?
"What do you mean, it has come?"
"What has come, my friends?"
The future.
Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.
Yes?
"You mean, today is yesterday?"
Yesterday is over.
"When yesterday ends, starts tomorrow."
Then the day after tomorrow.
Then two days after tomorrow.
Then...
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
"-Okay, in one shot!"
- One shot!
One shot!
One shot!
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
My present?
You want more?
"My present, my birthday present!"
You think I'm still a kid?
These are really popular these days.
Then you wear it.
We spent all day looking for this.
Just keep it.
"Quiet, both of you!"
You're so loud I can't understand anything.
Let me speak too.
What's his problem?
"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Letter to Santa.
"""Dear Santa, I have been SO good this year..."""
You know what?
No!
"No, I am not listening to any more of this!"
You're just jealous!
Long term exposure has compromised your ability to judge.
There is no way I am married to a selfish bastard!
(SMACK!)
"Focus, Denise!"
Think about all that you have sacrificed.
How could I be so stupid?
"Don't go there, Denise!"
You deserve so much more.
I do?
"Denise, you deserve oral sex."
But... he said that was...
Impossible.
That it's just...
A scam.
Can't he get help?
No.
It's terminal.
"If he were a loser or even a prick, maybe..."
NOOO!
I hate G-d!
I hate Christmas!
Pull yourself together!
Denise!
NOOOOO!!!
Your life is in danger.
Earthquake!
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

My Radha!
"Sister-in-law, why are you scared?"
Brother Shreekant has personally gone to look for her.
He'll arrest that rogue in no time.
Jamna!
Bring my Radha back.
That's it.
My Radha...
"Yes, sister-in-law."
She'll definitely come back.
She'll definitely come back.
But God...
In which condition?
I just can't think over it.
That young boy and young girl...
And she'll be all alone.
And that too in a jungle!
Wonder what he must be doing with her.
And Radha is so innocent.
She doesn't know anything about this world.
She's so innocent.

- Aunt!

Thank you.
Thank you.
"Um, I do have a question, though,"
"'cause I--my biggest worry is, you know, of course, my bandages and stuff."
But I've been taking a sh--
"I know I can take a shower, but I haven't."
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"
"Please, please, please?"
Bobby:
Oh.
Cathy:
"I just need to have a talk, okay?"
"Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are."
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.
"I just need us all to help each other, okay?"
"And I know that sometimes when we ask you to do something to help, sometimes it's 'cause you don't want to go upstairs 'cause you get scared."
He studies to be a journo.
His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."
You started this firm.
"I'm speaking for all the boys, we got the biggest ruck... ...of our lives coming up and your brother's too much of a bottle job to lead us."
The GSE is Pete's firm.

This has got to stop.
Hush!
I shwear that girl looks like Her Grace.
Huh?
Is Sulhi in?
"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
Are you mental?!
James:
The LHC master power's down there.
"It's shielded, we can shut it off."

So that's it?!
The worlds largest machine has an on/off switch?
Kate:
What is your problem?!
James:
"Look, this is just a relay."
There's six of them.
If one of them trips the others go off automatically.
Amy:
I hope somebody noticed that.
Connor:
There's nobody around to notice it.
No one will be in until tomorrow.
"All Rio has to do is get his victim safely to shore, grab the flag, and he wins."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Make sure not to let my head go under in case he went under."
I wanted to see where he was at all times.
Stay calm.
I'm here to rescue you.
You're going to be okay.
I got you.
"Just try to kick with me, all right?"
I'm swimming for the finish line.
That's when I see Paul.
Paul:
"I get to the bridge, I look out in the lake,"
I see two swamped canoes and some guy in the middle of the lake splashing around.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" We're almost there, okay?"
Paul:
Calm!
Stay calm!
Everything's coming back to me from my Life Saving merit badge.
Get the person calm in the water before you approach him.

"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
Whoa.

Tom might do it no hands style.
I feel like Tom would be like-- or something would happen.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"He would give you a reverse happy ending, remember?"
"He was like, oh, this masseuse, masseurs were like, accusing him of first of all, coining the term reverse happy ending."
"Which doesn't, it didn't exist until he came along with it."
TED LEO:
"I love imagining that in like, a Vinny Barbarino voice, that he'd be like, come on, man."

man speaking native language:
It's not easy to explain motivation.
Can I do something to reunite Korea?
It looks impossible.
It looks out of my hands.
Judging from that Yello Robe fellow's expressions... he must have wicked plans for Wanqing &amp;amp; Master Tuan.
No
I must try to inform the Tuan family first.
"Go, little snake."
Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."

[romantic music continues] man:
"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.

"Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down."

[Moses speaking native language]

Wow.
Wow.
"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."
"One, two, three..."
"One, two, three..."
Third discharge.
"One, two, three..."
He's gone.
Doctor!
Mom?
"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
A woman by the water took off her clothes and...
"You love me, don't you?"
Don't talk nonsense.
Love?
"In the chat room, yes."
Not in reality.
No.
"I love you, too."
Alright?
I love you.
Don't go.
"Love, my ass!"
Bastard.
"Are you selling out love now, too?"
You bastard.
You deserve it.
I love you.
For real.
What happened with the college student?
- He's going off to complete his army duty.
-Why?
All of a sudden?
He's running off from my husband.
That hurts.
"If the sun comes up will he come, When the wind blows he'll leave."
"When I look at you, you're ignoring me."
Please wind stop blowing.
Why are you eating everything?
Stop eating the bone.
"It's no use holding you, you just go away."
Please wind stop blowing.
I don't know
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
So you know our guys are looking forward to it.
It's an opportunity to play at home.
And to home course call it advantage if you want to but were looking forward to playing them at home.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Anything else you like to add?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Just that you know there's no admission to come and watch the golf team play.
The tournament is March 28th &amp;amp; 29th.
We'd like to see everybody out there and wishing the Leathernecks well.

No.
Skinny?

- It's my third time playing it.
I have played it on my phone once and didn't sleep for two days.
(Finebros) And what is the purpose of the game?
To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!

"I mean about Yaman... 1078 01:32:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:32:04,600 It looks like I went a little far for that kid... 1079 01:32:04,867 --&amp;gt; 01:32:08,056 Everyone will apply the brakes now."
"1080 01:32:08,519 --&amp;gt; 01:32:10,519 Really, I'm so sorry."
"1081 01:32:10,572 --&amp;gt; 01:32:13,155 I know how much you like helping as husband and wife."
"1082 01:32:13,195 --&amp;gt; 01:32:15,513 Especially what Ender did for us,"
"1083 01:32:16,851 --&amp;gt; 01:32:18,718 it's a wonderful thing."
"1084 01:32:18,800 --&amp;gt; 01:32:22,300 Without thinking at all she helped Faruk."
"1085 01:32:22,709 --&amp;gt; 01:32:24,624 Thanks!"

"1089 01:32:34,821 --&amp;gt; 01:32:38,418 Thank you very much to both of you."

Don't even mention it!
"1091 01:33:04,587 --&amp;gt; 01:33:07,706 Where am I going to put all this money?"
"1092 01:33:07,741 --&amp;gt; 01:33:11,132 I sent the demon away."
My luck turned around!
"1093 01:33:11,188 --&amp;gt; 01:33:13,549 We don't get the money we win 1094 01:33:13,554 --&amp;gt; 01:33:15,668 We put it in the contribution's case."
"1095 01:33:15,878 --&amp;gt; 01:33:17,665 Who says that?"
"1096 01:33:17,712 --&amp;gt; 01:33:20,271 Am I stupid dear?"

"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?

She's not coming back.

I'm scared.

"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."

"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.

The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.

I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?

"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."

Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!

Europa (moon)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
"Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

Before and After
"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon"
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
That's good.
Yeah.
"It was a late model,"
is that Chrysler van?
It's a eighty-seven.
"Yeah,"
one of the little mini vans?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Is a,"
Do you like the way it rides and stuff?
"Uh, rides or runs?"
Rides rough?
"It,"
"yeah,"
"well, yeah,"
"it rides, rides rough,"
it runs good.
Yeah.
"You know, I kind of,"
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
Yeah.
"You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway."
"Yeah,"
"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
Yeah.
"But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too."
"You driven American cars all,"
"Uh, yeah,"
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
and have a happy Thanksgiving.
"Thank you,"
you too.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"The way,"
I'll go ahead and start
"the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,"
Uh-huh.
"or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day."
Uh-huh.
"A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day."
"I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, it was very different before."
How do you dress?
"Well, I'm a drafter,"
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and I have sweatshirt on today.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much the norm for me.
"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant."
Uh-huh.
"So I don't know,"
it worked pretty well.
"It was one of those, uh, those, dome type pop up tents."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Nice and quick and easy to put up.
Yeah.
Packs away nice and small
"and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto."
"Well, that's true,"
that's true.
It was a lot of fun.
"I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias."
"Wow,"
that's got to be beautiful territory.
"Yeah,"
"it's gorgeous,"
I love the big trees.
"Just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though."
Yeah.
"What, like, Sequoia National Park?"
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had been there before when I lived in California,"
"but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe"
Yeah.
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy"
"but, you know, he's"
Uh-huh.
"I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
Uh-huh.
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well."
Yeah.
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months"
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"And with all the,"
"see I've got,"
on the south side is all glass.
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass."
Yeah.
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet."
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
Oh.
which my son goes hunting.
He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know."
"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"
right.
Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,"
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills"
and they're bouncing checks all over the place
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
"uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks."
"Well, we have,"
"we used to, when I was younger"
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
"I'm, uh, kind of a sailor."
Yeah.
"I'm up in Minneapolis now,"
but I was in Florida
"so, uh, yeah,"
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
"Yeah,"
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
"I had a little sail,"
"Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here"
No
"Just motorboat's all we,"
What part of Texas you from?
"Uh, Nacogdoches."
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and it's changed their perspective.
"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
Uh-huh.
"So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,"
"Well, that's, that's great."
"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
"Well that's,"
"Like I said, I think it does,"
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
Yes.
Well
"Well, I guess, um,"
did you have anything else?
"No,"
no
I guess that's about all.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, I enjoyed talking with you."
"Well, good talking with you."
And I hope you have a good evening.
You too.
Thanks.
Okay.
"Bye,"
bye.
Bye
Okay.
"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?"
Oh yes.
I'm an old experienced hand.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"

"""White Lies"", released in July 2007, is the first single from Paul van Dyk's album ""In Between"". It features vocals from Jessica Sutta, former member of the Pussycat Dolls."
"""I had a lot of fun working with Jessica. Her lascivious voice and sexy attitude reflects the theme of the single perfectly."" said Paul van Dyk via press release."
Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."
"On Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart it has been #1 for four weeks. It has also reaching #38 in Germany's pop charts, #4 in Turkey's top 100, #14 in Finland and #8 in Canada's top 40 charts."

"Charles Bodinier (6 January 1844 - 1911) was a French theater manager. After working for the Comédie-Française he became director of the Théâtre d'Application and then of the Théâtre La Bodinière. La Bodinière appealed to an elite audience, and staged a variety of lectures and performances until Bodinier retired in 1902."
"Charles Bodinier was born on 6 January 1844 in Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine-et-Loire."
"He became a professional soldier, and was captured in the war of 1870."
He was not released until 1874. In 1876 he joined the staff of the Comédie-Française.
Bodinier was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

"Nathan is most well known for creating the original music for ""Tomb Raider"". While creating the ""Tomb Raider"" music, he had an idea in mind to create music that sounded like English classical music. He notes that his influences might have come from English classical music that his father used to play when he was small. He wrote the entire score for the first ""Tomb Raider"" in four weeks without insight on the game levels to help him draw the music accordingly. On the following two games he was still getting very limited descriptions for what musical elements he needed."

Frank Hay Gillingham (6 September 1875 – 1 April 1953) was an English cricketer. He played for Essex between 1903 and 1928.
"Born in Tokyo to a J. Gillingham, he was educated at Dulwich College and Durham University. He worked in the city of London for a while but was ordained as a priest in 1899 and became curate of Leyton. He later became an army chaplain with the 2nd Battalion The South Wales Borderers at Tidworth from 1905 to 1907 and again as Temporary Chaplain to the Forces during the First World War."
"As an amateur cricketer he was a member of the Essex XI who in 1905 beat the Australians at Leyton by 19 runs. He then went on to tour Jamaica with the Hon. L H Tennyson's team in 1927. That year he also made the first ball-by-ball cricket commentary for the BBC, speaking for a total of 25 minutes over four sessions. He was reportedly fired by BBC chairman Lord Reith for reading advertisement placards out on air to fill time during a rain break."
"In 1939, the Reverend Gillingham was appointed Chaplain to the Royal household."

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

"Royals may be best known for a bad punt he kicked in the 1993 NFL season AFC wildcard game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs on January 8, 1994. Near the end of the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading Kansas City by seven points, Royals failed to direct a punt towards a sideline, and instead, punted the ball forward directly towards the line of scrimmage. The punt was blocked and recovered by Kansas City. With 1:43 remaining in the fourth quarter and on 4th down, Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to receiver Tim Barnett. The ensuing PAT tied the game which then went into sudden death overtime.

= = = Shepperd's Dell = = =
"Shepperd's Dell is a small canyon in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, located at"
which is less than one-third mile (500 m) southeast of Rooster Rock State Park.
"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

= = = Anne of Foix-Candale = = =
Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery.

The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game."
"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."
"To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high-capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD.

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."

"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer."
"""Calabria"" left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Schütze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."

Compound NJ2 is a xanthylium yellowish pigment found in wine.
"In model solutions, colorless compounds, such as catechin, can give rise to new types of pigments. The first step is the formation of colorless dimeric compounds consisting of two flavanol units linked by carboxy-methine bridge. This is followed by the formation of xanthylium salt yellowish pigments and their ethylesters, resulting from the dehydration of the colorless dimers, followed by an oxidation process. The loss of a water molecule takes place between two A ring hydroxyl groups of the colorless dimers."

They go into a cave to escape capture, but Chi is bitten by a poisonous snake. He finds a medicine belonging to an ancient hero named Long Jianfei and shares it with Tak-fai.

"Fai and Chi remain skeptical about the things that happened and they bring the two ladies to Hong Kong. Yunluo is able to adapt to modern life in Hong Kong very quickly. On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott. He entered a Catholic seminary, but left without taking orders. He went to Paris and engaged in journalism, and taught science and classics in the Athlone and Sligo Intermediate schools. In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900. He was elected to Sligo County Council on its establishment in 1899 and became its first chairman."
"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing. In 1906 he was returned unopposed both for North Leitrim and for North Sligo, and chose to sit for the latter constituency, which he represented until his death in 1909."

"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."

"Dave Smith Motors is a car dealership in Kellogg, Idaho, that attracts customers from all over the country. The dealership has a reputation for being the ""World’s Largest Ram Dealer""."
"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."

"The Holy Quran: Arabic Text and English translation (completed 1936, published 1955) is a parallel text edition of the Quran compiled and translated by Maulvi Sher Ali, an Ahmadiyya missionary at the Fazl Mosque in London. This current version has been published with an alternative translation of, and footnotes to, some of the verses, by Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth successor of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Since its first publication in 1955 in the Netherlands, many editions have appeared in different countries. In 1997, an appendix was added at the end."
"An ex-evangelist, Clay Chip Smith, has reviewed the translation as, ""clear and worded satisfactorily"". The Islamic Studies department of the University of Georgia (US) has included the translation in its ""Islamic Resources"" webpage . A large Indian monthly from Bangalore, the ""Islamic Voice"", has cited it in its comparison to other contemporary translations of the Quran. The translation, as an Ahmadiyya Movement contribution has been mentioned by the multi-disciplinary study, ""The Black Studies Reader""."
This version of Quranic translation is done by a non-islamic group. Be careful
